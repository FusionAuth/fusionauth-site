For example, a FusionAuth Application for a game might have one CleanSpeak Application for usernames and another Application for chat.

This property is used when CleanSpeak sends user action notifications to FusionAuth (when users are disciplined for example). FusionAuth will translate the CleanSpeak ids to FusionAuth ids and then apply the user action.

|[field]#application.cleanSpeakConfiguration.usernameModeration.applicationId# [type]#[UUID]# [optional]#Optional#
|The Id of the CleanSpeak application that usernames are sent to for moderation.

|[field]#application.cleanSpeakConfiguration.usernameModeration.enabled# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `false`#
|True if CleanSpeak username moderation is enabled.

|[field]#application.data# [type]#[Object]# [optional]#Optional#

|Determines if the OAuth 2.0 Token endpoint will generate a refresh token or not. This flag needs to be true, the scope needs to include `offline_access` and a device identifier needs to be supplied for FusionAuth to generate a refresh token.

|[field]#application.oauthConfiguration.logoutURL# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|The logout URL for the Application. FusionAuth will redirect to this URL after the user logs out of OAuth.

|[field]#application.oauthConfiguration.requireClientAuthentication# [type]#[boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#Defaults to `false`# [since]#Available Since 1.3.0#
