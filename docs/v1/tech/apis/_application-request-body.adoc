|An array of UUIDs that map to the CleanSpeak applications for this Application. It is possible that a single Application in FusionAuth might have multiple Applications in CleanSpeak. For example, a FusionAuth Application for a game might have one CleanSpeak Application for usernames and another Application for chat.

This property is used when CleanSpeak sends user action notifications to FusionAuth (when users are disciplined for example). FusionAuth will translate the CleanSpeak ids to FusionAuth ids and then apply the user action.

include::_jwt_algorithm.adoc[]

Required when `enabled` is set to `true`.

When an HMAC algorithm is used such as `HS256`, `HS384` or `HS512`, the OAuth `client_secret` will be used as the signing secret.

|[field]#application.jwtConfiguration.enabled# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#Defaults to `false`#
|Indicates if this application is using the JWT configuration defined here or the global JWT configuration defined by the System Configuration. If this is `false` the signing algorithm configured in the System Configuration will be used. If `true` the signing algorithm defined in this application will be used.

|[field]#application.jwtConfiguration.privateKey# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|The private key used when an `RSA` or `ECDSA` based signing algorithm has been selected. The private key will be used to sign the JWT. This key is expected to be presented in a PEM encoded format.

Required when `enabled` is set to `true`.

|[field]#application.loginConfiguration.allowTokenRefresh# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#Defaults to `false`# [since]#Available Since 1.5.0#
|Indicates if a JWT may be refreshed using a Refresh Token for this application. This configuration is separate from issuing new Refresh Tokens which is controlled by the `generateRefreshTokens` parameter. This configuration indicates specifically if an existing Refresh Token may be used to request a new JWT using the link:jwt#refresh-a-jwt[Refresh API].
