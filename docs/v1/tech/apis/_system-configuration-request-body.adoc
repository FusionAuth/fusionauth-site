This could be caused by the user messing with the URL or internally some type of information wasn't passed between the OAuth endpoints correctly. For example, if you are federating login to an external IdP and that IdP does not properly echo the `state` parameter, FusionAuth's OAuth workflow will break and this page will be displayed.

|[field]#systemConfiguration.uiConfiguration.loginTheme.passwordSent# [type]#[String]#
|A https://freemarker.apache.org[FreeMarker] template that is rendered when the user requests the /password/sent page. This page is used when a user has submitted the forgot password form with their email. FusionAuth does not indicate back to the user if their email address was valid in order to prevent malicious activity that could reveal valid email addresses. Therefore, this page should indicate to the user that if their email was valid, they will receive an email shortly with a link to reset their password.

|[field]#systemConfiguration.uiConfiguration.loginTheme.registrationComplete# [type]#[String]#
|A https://freemarker.apache.org[FreeMarker] template that is rendered when the user requests the /registration/complete page.

|[field]#systemConfiguration.uiConfiguration.loginTheme.emailVerify# [type]#[String]#
|A https://freemarker.apache.org[FreeMarker] template that is rendered when the user requests the /registration/verify page by clicking the URL from the application specific verification email and the `verificationId` has expired. FusionAuth expires `verificationId` after a period of time (which is configurable). If the user has a URL from the verification email that has expired, this page will be rendered and the error will be displayed to the user.

|[field]#systemConfiguration.uiConfiguration.loginTheme.stylesheet# [type]#[String]#
