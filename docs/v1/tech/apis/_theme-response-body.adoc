|[field]#theme.loginTemplate.emailVerify# [type]#[String]#
|A https://freemarker.apache.org[FreeMarker] template that is rendered when the user requests the /email/verify page by clicking the URL from the verification email and the `verificationId` has expired.

|A https://freemarker.apache.org[FreeMarker] template that is rendered when the user requests the /oauth2/error page. This page is used if the user starts or is in the middle of the OAuth workflow and any type of error occurs. This could be caused by the user messing with the URL or internally some type of information wasn't passed between the OAuth endpoints correctly. For example, if you are federating login to an external IdP and that IdP does not properly echo the `state` parameter, FusionAuth's OAuth workflow will break and this page will be displayed.

|A https://freemarker.apache.org[FreeMarker] template that is rendered when the user requests the /oauth2/logout page. This page is used if the user initiates a logout. This page causes the user to be logged out of all associated applications via a front-channel mechanism before being redirected.

This page is used when a user has submitted the forgot password form with their email.
