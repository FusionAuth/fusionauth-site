== Overview

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are portable identity tokens. A JWT is issued after completing a link:login#authenticate-a-user[Login] request. In this document
the term JWT and access token are used interchangeably.

* <<Reconcile a JWT>>
* <<Refresh a JWT>>
* <<Validate a JWT>>
* <<Retrieve Public Keys>>
* <<Retrieve Refresh Tokens>>
* <<Revoke Refresh Tokens>>


== Issue a JWT
This API is used to issue a new access token (JWT) using an existing access token (JWT).

This API provides the single signon mechanism for access tokens. For example you have an access token for application A and you need an access
token for application B. You may use this API to request an access token to application B with the authorized token to application A. The returned access token will have the same expiration of the one provided.

=== Request

== Reconcile a JWT
The Reconcile API is used to take a JWT issued by a third party identity provider as described by an link:identity-providers[Identity Provider]
configuration and reconcile the User represented by the JWT to FusionAuth.

=== Request

link:authentication#no-authentication-required[icon:unlock-alt[role=green]] Reconcile a JWT
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#POST# [uri]#/api/jwt/reconcile#
--

[cols="3a,7a"]
[.api]
.Request Headers
|===
|[field]#X-Forwarded-For# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|The IP address of a client requesting authentication. If the IP address is provided it will be stored for login history of the user. It is
generally preferred to specify the IP address in the request body. If it is not provided in the request body this header value will be used
if available, the request body value will take precedence.
|===

include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_reconcile-request-body.adoc[]

=== Response

The response for this API contains the User object.

[cols="1,9a"]
.Response Codes
|===
|Code |Description

|200
|The reconcile was successful. The response will contain the User object that was authenticated.

|400
|The request was invalid and/or malformed. The response will contain an link:errors[Errors] JSON Object with the specific errors.

|401
|The request cannot be completed. The `identityProviderId` is invalid, the JWT signature cannot be validated, the JWT does not contain a claim
identified by the `uniqueIdentityClaim` property in the Identity Provider configuration, or the domain of the email address claim in the JWT
is not managed by the Identity Provider Configuration.

|404
|The user was not found or the password was incorrect. The response will be empty.

|500
|There was an internal error. A stack trace is provided and logged in the FusionAuth log files. The response will be empty.

|503
|The search index is not available or encountered an exception so the request cannot be completed. The response will contain a JSON body.

.Response Cookies
|===
|[field]#access_token# [type]#[String]#
|The encoded access token. This cookie is written in the response as an HTTP Only session cookie.

|[field]#refresh_token# [type]#[String]#
|The refresh token. This cookie is written in the response as an HTTP only persistent cookie. The cookie expiration is configured in the JWT
configuration for the application or the global JWT configuration.

== Retrieve Public Keys

This API is used to retrieve Public Keys used to cryptographically verify JWT signatures signed using the corresponding RSA or ECDSA private key.

=== Request

link:authentication#no-authentication-required[icon:unlock-alt[role=green]] Retrieve all Public Keys
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#GET# [uri]#/api/jwt/public-key#
--

link:authentication#no-authentication-required[icon:unlock-alt[role=green]] Retrieve a single Public Key for a specific Application by Key Identifier
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#GET# [uri]#/api/jwt/public-key``?applicationId=\{applicationId\}``#
--

[cols="3a,7a"]
[.api]
.Request Parameters
|===
|[field]#applicationId# [type]#[UUID]# [optional]#Optional#
|The Application Id is used to retrieve a specific Public Key. This will return the Public Key that has been specifically configured for the provided Application.

A public key may not be available for an Application if it is configured to use the global JWT configuration or a HMAC is the configured algorithm for JWT signing.
|===

=== Response

:no_errors:

.Response Body for a all Public Keys
|===
|[field]#publicKeys# [type]#[Map<String, String>]#
|The public keys keyed by the Application Id.

There is one special key value named `default`. If this value exists in the response, this will be the public key that will be used when signing JSON Web Tokens when the Application has not specified its own JWT configuration.
