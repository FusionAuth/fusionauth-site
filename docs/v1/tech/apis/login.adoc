== Overview

This page contains the APIs that are used to authenticate and track user logins.

* <<Authenticate a User>>
* <<Complete Two Factor Authentication>>
* <<Update Login Instant>>
* <<Logout a User>>


== Authenticate a User

The Login API is used authenticate a user in FusionAuth.

=== Request

link:authentication#no-authentication-required[icon:unlock-alt[role=green]] Authenticate a User.

[.api]
.Request Headers
|===
|[field]#X-Forwarded-For# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|The IP address of a client requesting authentication. If the IP address is provided it will be stored for login history of the user. It is
generally preferred to specify the IP address in the request body. If it is not provided in the request body this header value will be used
if available, the request body value will take precedence.
|===

[cols="3a,7a"]
[.api]
.Request Body
|===
|[field]#applicationId# [type]#[UUID]# [optional]#Optional#
|The Id of the Application the user is to be logged into. If this parameter is omitted the user will still be authenticated but a login
count will not be recorded for an Application.

|[field]#device# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|The unique device identifier for this request. This value should be unique to the device and the same device Id should be sent on subsequent requests for the same device.

Using this parameter will indicate you wish to receive a refresh token on the response. The refresh token will be written on the HTTP response as an HTTP only persistent cookie named `refresh_token`, and also be provided in the JSON response body.

|[field]#ipAddress# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|The IP address of the end-user that is logging into FusionAuth. If this value is omitted FusionAuth will attempt to obtain the IP address of
the client, the value will be that of the `X-Forwarded-For` header if provided or the last proxy that sent the request. The IP address will
be stored in the User login history.

|[field]#loginId# [type]#[String]# [required]#Required#
|The login identifier of the user. The login identifier can be either the `email` or the `username`.

|[field]#metaData.device.description# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|A human readable description of the device represented by the `device` parameter.

|[field]#metaData.device.lastAccessedAddress# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|The IP address of this login request.

|[field]#metaData.device.name# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|A human readable name of the device represented by the `device` parameter.

|[field]#metaData.device.type# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|The type of device represented by the `device` parameter. The following types may be specified:

* `BROWSER`
* `DESKTOP`
* `LAPTOP`
* `MOBILE`
* `OTHER`
* `SERVER`
* `TABLET`
* `TV`
* `UNKNOWN`

|[field]#noJWT# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `false`#
|When this value is set to true a JWT will not be issued as part of this request. The response body will not contain the `token` field, and the `access_token` and `refresh_token` cookies will not be written to the HTTP response.

This optional parameter may be helpful when performing high volume authentication requests and the JWT is not being utilized, in this scenario removing the additional latency required to issue and sign the JWT may have a measurable cumulative effect on performance.

|[field]#password# [type]#[String]# [required]#Required#
|The user's password or an Application specific link:../tutorials/authentication-tokens[Authentication Token].

|[field]#twoFactorTrustId# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|The Two Factor Trust identifier returned by the Two Factor Login API response. This value be may be provided to bypass the Two Factor challenge when a User has Two Factor enabled.

The default duration of this identifier is 5 minutes. This means that you have 5 minutes to complete the request to this API after

== Update Login Instant

Sends a ping to FusionAuth indicating that the user was automatically logged into an application. When using FusionAuth's SSO or your own, you
should call this if the user is already logged in centrally, but accesses an application where they no longer have a session. This helps
correctly track login counts, times and helps with reporting.

=== Request

link:authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[role=red]] Update the login instant for a given User and Application

|The Id of the Application the user is logging into.

|[field]#ipAddress# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|The IP address of the end-user that is logging into FusionAuth. If this value is omitted FusionAuth will attempt to obtain the IP address of
the client, the value will be that of the `X-Forwarded-For` header if provided or the last proxy that sent the request. The IP address will
be stored in the User login history.
