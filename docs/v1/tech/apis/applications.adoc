description: The APIs for creating, retrieving, updating and deleting Applications
---

== Overview

This page contains the APIs that are used to manage Applications as well as the Roles of an Application. Here are the APIs:

* <<Create an Application>>
* <<Retrieve an Application>>
* <<Update an Application>>
* <<Delete an Application>>
* <<Reactivate an Application>>
* <<Create an Application Role>>
* <<Update an Application Role>>
* <<Delete an Application Role>>
* <<Retrieve OAuth Configuration>>

== Create an Application

This API is used to create an Application. Specifying an Id on the URI will instruct Passport to use that Id when creating the Application. Otherwise, Passport will generate an Id for the Application.

=== Request

link:authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[role=red]] Create an Application with a generated Id
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#POST# [uri]#/api/application#
--

link:authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[role=red]] Create an Application with the given Id
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#POST# [uri]#/api/application/`\{applicationId\}`#
--

[cols="3a,7a"]
[.api]
.Request Parameters
|===
|[field]#applicationId# [type]#[UUID]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to a generated UUID#
|The Id to use for the new Application. If not specified a secure random UUID will be generated.
|===

[cols="3a,7a"]
[.api]
.Request Body
|===
|[field]#application.authenticationTokenConfiguration.enabled# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `false`#
|Determines if Users can have Authentication Tokens associated with this Application. This feature may not be enabled for the Passport application.

|[field]#application.cleanSpeakConfiguration.applicationIds# [type]#[Array<UUID>]# [optional]#Optional#
|An array of UUIDs that map to the CleanSpeak applications for this Application. It is possible that a single Application in Passport might have multiple Applications in CleanSpeak. For example, an Passport Application for a game might have one CleanSpeak Application for usernames and another Application for chat.

This property is used when CleanSpeak sends user action notifications to Passport (when users are disciplined for example). Passport will translate the CleanSpeak ids to Passport ids and then apply the user action.

|[field]#application.cleanSpeakConfiguration.usernameModeration.applicationId# [type]#[UUID]# [optional]#Optional#
|The Id of the CleanSpeak application that usernames are sent to for moderation.

|[field]#application.cleanSpeakConfiguration.usernameModeration.enabled# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `false`#
|True if CleanSpeak username moderation is enabled.

|[field]#application.jwtConfiguration.algorithm# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|
include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_jwt_algorithm.adoc[]

Required when `enabled` is set to `true`.

|[field]#application.jwtConfiguration.enabled# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#Defaults to `false`#
|Indicates if this application is using the JWT configuration defined here or the global JWT configuration defined by the System Configuration. If this is `false` the signing algorithm configured in the System Configuration will be used. If `true` the signing algorithm defined in this application will be used.

|[field]#application.jwtConfiguration.privateKey# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|The private key used when an `RSA` signing algorithm has been selected. The private key will be used to sign the JWT. This key is expected to be presented in a PEM encoded format.

Required when `enabled` is set to `true` and `algorithm` is set to an `RSA` based value.

|[field]#application.jwtConfiguration.publicKey# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|The public key used when an `RSA` signing algorithms has been selected. The public key will be used to verify JWTs signed with the private key. This key is expected to be presented in a PEM encoded format.

Required when `enabled` is set to `true` and `algorithm` is set to an `RSA` based value.

|[field]#application.jwtConfiguration.refreshTokenTimeToLiveInMinutes# [type]#[Integer]# [optional]#Optional#
|The length of time in minutes the JWT refresh token will live before it is expired and is not able to be exchanged for a JWT.

Required when `enabled` is set to `true`.

== Retrieve an Application

This API is used to retrieve one or all of the configured Applications. Specifying an Id on the URI will retrieve a single Application. Leaving off the Id will retrieve all of the Applications.

=== Request

link:authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[role=red]] Retrieve all of the active Applications
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#GET# [uri]#/api/application#
--

link:authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[role=red]] Retrieve all of the inactive Applications
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#GET# [uri]#/api/application``?inactive=true``#
--

[cols="3a,7a"]
[.api]
.Request Parameters
|===
|[field]#inactive# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional#
|Set this parameter to `true` in order to retrieve only inactive Applications. Setting this parameter to `false` is equivalent omitting the `inactive` parameter.
|===

link:authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[role=red]] Retrieve a single Application by Id
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#GET# [uri]#/api/application/`\{applicationId\}`#
--

[cols="3a,7a"]
[.api]
.Request Parameters
|===
|[field]#applicationId# [type]#[UUID]# [optional]#Optional#
|The Id of the Application to retrieve. This request will return the Application if it exists regardless if the Application is active or not.
|===

=== Response

The response for this API contains either a single Application or all of the Applications. When you call this API with an Id the response will contain just that Application. When you call this API without an Id the response will contain all of the Applications. Both response types are defined below along with an example JSON response.

== Update an Application

This API is used to update an existing Application. You must specify the Id of the Application you are updating on the URI. You must specify all of the properties of the Application when calling this API. This API doesn't merge the existing Application and your new data. It replaces the existing Application with your new data.

[NOTE]
====
You can't update an Application's roles via this API. This prevents you from accidentally removing all the roles of an Application. To create, update or remove a role from the Application, you need to call one of these APIs:

* <<Create an Application Role>>
* <<Update an Application Role>>
* <<Delete an Application Role>>
