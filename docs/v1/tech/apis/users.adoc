=== Request

link:authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[role=red]] Search for Users by Id

.Request Parameters
|===
|[field]#ids# [type]#[UUID]# [optional]#Optional#
|A User Id to retrieve. By specifying this URL parameter multiple times you can lookup multiple Users. Using this parameter is mutually exclusive with the `queryString` and is not paginated or sorted using the `sortFields`.

Using this parameter will not hit the Elasticsearch index, instead it will cause users to be retrieved by Id only.

|The number of search results to return. Used for pagination.

|[field]#queryString# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#

|The start row within the search results to return. Used for pagination.

|[field]#sortFields# [type]#[Array]# [optional]#Optional#
|An array of sort fields used to sort the result. The order the sort fields are provided will be maintained in the sorted output.

|[field]#sortFields``[x]``.missing# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `_last`#
|The value to substitute if this field is not defined. Two special values may be used:

* `_first` When the field is not defined sort this record first.
* `_last` When the field is not defined sort this record last.

|[field]#sortFields``[x]``.name# [type]#[String]# [required]#Required#
|The name of the field to sort.

Due to how the search index is structured not all fields on the user are sortable. The following field names are supported.

* `birthDate`
* `email`
* `fullName`
* `insertInstant`
* `login`
* `username`

|[field]#sortFields``[x]``.order# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `asc`#
|The order to sort the specified field. Possible values are:

* `asc`
* `desc`

== Start Forgot Password Workflow

This API is used to start the forgot password workflow for a single User.

For example, on your login form you may have a button for _Forgot your password_. This would be the API you would call to initiate the request for the user. If the email configuration is complete, the user
 will be sent the forgot password email containing a link containing the `changePasswordId`. The provided link should take the user to a form that allows them to change their password. This form should contain a hidden
  field for the `changePasswordId` generated by this API.

By default the `changePasswordId` is valid to be used with the link:#change-a-user-s-password[Change Password] API for 10 minutes. If a `404` is returned when using this Id to change the password, the workflow
will need to be started again to generate a new identifier. This duration can be modified using the System Configuration API or in the FusionAuth UI.

You may optionally authenticate this request with an API key to allow for some additional request parameters and the generated `changePasswordId` will be returned in the JSON body.
 This may be helpful if you wish to use your own email system or you have an alternative method to call the link:#change-a-user-s-password[Change Password] API.

=== Request

|[field]#changePasswordId# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|The optional change password Id to be used on the <<change-a-user-s-password,Change a User's Password>> API.

It is recommended to omit this parameter and allow FusionAuth to generate the identifier. Use this parameter only if you must supply your own
value for integration into existing systems.

|[field]#loginId# [type]#[String]# [required]#Required#
|The login identifier of the user. The login identifier can be either the `email` or the `username`. The username is not case sensitive.

|[field]#sendForgotPasswordEmail# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `true`#
|Whether or not calling this API should attempt to send the user an email using the Forgot Password Email Template. Setting this to
false will skip the email attempt and only set the `changePasswordId` for the user.

== Change a User's Password

This API is used to change the User's password.

This API may be used as the second part of the Forgot Password workflow. For example, after the User is sent an email that contains a link to
 a web form that allows them to update their password you will call this API with the `changePasswordId` and their updated password. If the
  `changePasswordId` is valid then the User's password will be updated.

This API may also be used separately from the Forgot Password workflow by omitting the `changePasswordId` and using the `loginId` instead.

By default the `changePasswordId` is valid for 10 minutes after it was generated. If a `404` is returned when using the change password Id,
the workflow will need to be started again to generate a new identifier. This duration can be modified using the System Configuration API or in the FusionAuth UI.


[NOTE]
====
When this API successfully completes, all refresh tokens and outstanding Change Password Ids (i.e. `changePasswordId`) currently assigned to the user will be expired or revoked. This means
that if a user is using a refresh token they will be forced to re-authenticate with their new password.

|[field]#changePasswordId# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|The `changePasswordId` that is used to identity the user after the Start Forgot Password workflow has been initiated.

When this value is provided it should be in place of the `loginId` in the request body. If both the `changePasswordId` and `loginId` are
 provided on the request, the `changePasswordId` will take precedence.

If this `changePasswordId` was sent via an email to the User by FusionAuth during User create in order to set up a new password, or as
part of a Forgot Password request the successful use of this identifier to change the User's password will implicitly verify
the User if not already verified.

== Flush the Search Engine

This API is used to issue a flush request to the FusionAuth Search. This will cause any cached data to be written to disk. In practice it is unlikely
 you'll find a need for this API in production unless you are performing search requests immediately following an operation that modifies the index and
  expecting to see the results immediately.
