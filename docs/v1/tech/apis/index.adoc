== Overview

The core of FusionAuth is a set of RESTful APIs that allow you to quickly integrate login, registration and advanced User management features into your application. The FusionAuth web UI is built upon these APIs, with the exception of managing API keys everything in the UI is available through an API.

On this page you will find links to each of the API groups and a general overview of the API status codes you can expect back from each API. Each API will also document specific status codes and the specific meaning of the status code.

== Status Codes

Each API may document specific status codes and provide a specific reason for returning that status code. This is a general overview of the status codes you may expect from an API and what they will mean to you.

.Response Codes
|===
|Code |Description

|200
|The request was successful. Generally the response body will contain JSON unless documented otherwise.

|400
|The request was invalid and/or malformed. The response will contain an link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/errors[Errors] JSON Object with the specific errors.

|401
|The request authentication failed. This request requires authentication and the API key was either omitted or invalid. In some cases this may also be returned if you are not authorized to make the request. See link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication[Authentication] for additional information on API authentication.

|404
|The object you requested doesn't exist. The response will be empty.

|405
|The HTTP method you requested is not allowed for the URI. This is a user error in making the HTTP request to the API. For example, if `POST` is the only supported way to call a particular API and you make the HTTP request with `GET`, you will receive a `405` status code. No body will be returned.

|500
|There was an internal error. A stack trace is provided and logged in the FusionAuth log files. The response will be empty. This is generally a FusionAuth error condition. If possible open a https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues[GitHub Issue] so we can help you resolve the issue.

|501
|The HTTP method you requested is not implemented. This is a user error in making the HTTP request to the API.
