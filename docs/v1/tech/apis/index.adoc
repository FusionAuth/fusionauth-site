== Overview

The core of FusionAuth is a set of RESTful APIs that allow you to quickly integrate login, registration and advanced User management features into your application. The FusionAuth web UI is built upon these APIs, with the exception of managing API keys everything in the UI is available through an API.

[NOTE]
====
When you send a JSON request body to a FusionAuth API ensure you have added the following HTTP header `Content-Type: application/json`. If your REST client has a JSON body option is is likely setting this header for you, but if you are building your own HTTP request ensure this header is provided on the request.
