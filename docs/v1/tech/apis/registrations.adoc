== Overview

This page contains the APIs that are used to manage User Registrations. A registration is the association between a User and an Application that they log into. Here are the APIs:

* <<Create a User Registration (for an existing user)>>
* <<Create a User and Registration (combined)>>
* <<Retrieve a User Registration>>
* <<Update a User Registration>>
* <<Delete a User Registration>>
* <<Verify a User Registration>>
* <<Resend a User Registration Verification Email>>

== Create a User Registration (for an existing user)

This API is used to create a new User Registration for an existing User. If the User has already created their global account but is now creating an account for an Application, this is the API you will use to create the new account. You must specify the User Id being registered on the URI. The Id of the Application the User is registering for is sent in the request body.

=== Request

[.api-authentication]
link:authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[role=red]] Create a User Registration for an existing User

== Create a User and Registration (combined)

This API is used to create a new User and a User Registration in a single request. This is useful if for example you have a main website that User's create their account on initially. The User is technically creating their global User object and a User Registration for that website (i.e. that Application). In this case, you will want to create the User and the User Registration in a single step. This is the API to use for that. You can optionally still provide an Id for the new User on the URI. If you don't specify an Id for the User, FusionAuth will create one for you.

=== Request

[.api-authentication]
link:authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[role=red]] Create a User and a User Registration in a single API call
[.endpoint]
.URI

--

[cols="3a,7a"]

.Request Parameters
|===
|[field]#userId# [type]#[UUID]# [optional]#Optional#
|The Id to use for the new User. If you don't specify this, FusionAuth will generate a random UUID.
