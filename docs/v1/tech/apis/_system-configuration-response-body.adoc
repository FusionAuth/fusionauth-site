|A https://freemarker.apache.org[FreeMarker] template that is rendered when the user requests the /password/sent page. This page is used when a user has submitted the forgot password form with their email. FusionAuth does not indicate back to the user if their email address was valid in order to prevent malicious activity that could reveal valid email addresses. Therefore, this page should indicate to the user that if their email was valid, they will receive an email shortly with a link to reset their password.

|[field]#systemConfiguration.uiConfiguration.loginTheme.registrationComplete# [type]#[String]#
|A https://freemarker.apache.org[FreeMarker] template that is rendered when the user requests the /registration/complete page.
