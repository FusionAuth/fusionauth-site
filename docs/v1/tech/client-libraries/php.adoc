include_once 'FusionAuthClient.php'

$client = new FusionAuthClient('6b87a398-39f2-4692-927b-13188a81a9a3', 'http://localhost:9011');

$email = "user@example.com";
$response = client->retrieveUserByEmail($email);
if($response->wasSuccessful()){
    $user = $response->successResponse->user;
} else {
    // Handle $response->errorResponse or $response->exception
}
