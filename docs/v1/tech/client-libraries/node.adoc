const client = new PassportClient('6b87a398-39f2-4692-927b-13188a81a9a3', 'http://passport.local');

// Retrieve User by Email Address
client.retrieveUserByEmail('user@example.com')
       .then(handleResponse);

function handleResponse (clientResponse) {
  console.info(JSON.stringify(clientResponse.successResponse.user, null, 2));
}
