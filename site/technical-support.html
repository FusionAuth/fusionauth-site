          As the FusionAuth community has grown, so has the number of support requests. We thought writing technical support guidelines would help customers, FusionAuth team members, and the community understand how to get technical support for FusionAuth.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're engineers. We’d love to help everyone with everything, but we are a team with limited resources. Sharing these guidelines will allow us to continue to move the product forward and ensure we can prioritize our limited support resources efficiently.

          This document is evolving and we welcome your feedback; please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> to share it.

            Whether you have a paid edition of FusionAuth that includes engineering support, or are one of the thousands of developers in the FusionAuth community, you’ll get answers more quickly if you provide the following information about your issue:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>What you are trying to do, specific step by step of clicks you make, APIs you’ve called, configuration you have, things you’ve changed, etc. More information is better. For example, what you are seeing, specific panels in the UI, API status codes, errors, screenshots, etc. We want all of it.</li>
            <li>What you expected to see. Sometimes this is obvious, and sometimes it isn’t. Err on the side of over sharing. </li>
            <li>What you've tried already. Sometimes this can help us narrow down the issue more quickly.</li>
            <li>The version of FusionAuth you are using (this information is available on the admin screen in the lower left hand corner).</li>
            <li>The number of FusionAuth nodes you are running in your deployment.</li>
            <li>Information about supporting infrastructure such as the database and elasticsearch, including the version and architecture (is the database local, cloud managed, etc).</li>
            <li><a href="/docs/v1/tech/troubleshooting/">All FusionAuth log files</a> you can provide. Please don't provide snippets because often the issue won't be in the snippet but somewhere else in the logs. Providing us with complete log files upfront helps us track down issues faster. And you'll avoid getting replies like "please send the complete log files". Of course, please remove any sensitive information from the log files.</li>
</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you don’t provide this information initially, expect the FusionAuth team to ask for it.

          <p>
            If you have a paid edition which includes technical support, please <a href="https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/">open a ticket via your account portal</a>. This ensures that we will see it; slack messages or emails can unfortunately get lost. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Paid support plans have access to the engineering team.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            When you open a ticket, you will get a response within <a href="/pricing/">the documented time window for your edition</a>, and typically sooner.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have a hosted FusionAuth instance running in FusionAuth Cloud, we provide support <b>related to the operation of your instance</b>. This includes upgrades, SLA (if applicable), backups/restores (if applicable) and downtime. FusionAuth Cloud support does not include support for implementation questions. That support requires purchase of an edition including technical support.

          <p>
            If you run the community or developer edition of FusionAuth and need technical support, please <a href="/community/forum/search">search the forum</a>, <a href="/community/forum/">post your question to the forum</a>, or <a href="/docs/v1/tech/">review our extensive documentation</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            With community support, we can't offer a guaranteed response time. The timeline for an answer in the forum depends on what other community members can provide as well as the demands on the FusionAuth community support team. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In most cases our community support team is able to review community requests and respond within a week.

          <h2><img src="/assets/img/icons/community-support-limits.svg" alt="Community Support Limitations">&nbsp;&nbsp;Community Support Limitations</h2>
          <p>
            There are certain classes of problems with which the FusionAuth community support team will not help. You are welcome to post these quesitons in the forums to get feedback and to educate other community members, however. 
          </p>
          <p>
            We are engineers and it pains us to not answer every question we can. We were born to solve problems. However, when it comes to architecture decisions or system performance it is just not possible for us to field these questions through the community channels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Architecture questions require a lot of context and knowledge of your application and infrastructure. The number of variables to be accounted for when offering performance advice is not trivial.
          </p>
          <p>
            For these reasons, we require a paid support plan to assist with these types of issues:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Production issues</li>
            <li>Architectural, design and integration guidance</li>
            <li>Performance tuning or load testing</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Some examples of questions the community support team won't be able to answer:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>I want to build my application using feature X and Y; how should I best leverage FusionAuth?</li>
            <li>I have 1M users and my FusionAuth instance is slow; can you help?</li>
            <li>I want to connect FusionAuth to [other service]. How do I do that?</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
