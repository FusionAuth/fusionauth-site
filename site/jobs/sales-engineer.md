### Overview

FusionAuth is a fast growing startup headquartered in Denver Colorado. We are expanding our team to help accelerate our growth and take FusionAuth to the next level.
 
Our mission is to make authentication and authorization simple and secure for every developer. This means building the best IAM (Identity and Access Management) and CIAM (Customer Identity and Access Management) solution in the world.

Ideally, you should be capable of coding and have knowledge of the industry including OAuth, SAML, OIDC, SSO, MFA, and other IAM standards.

* Engage with the FusionAuth Slack community and StackOverflow community
