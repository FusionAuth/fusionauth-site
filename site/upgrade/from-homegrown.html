            <h2>Auth is complex and doesn't earn revenue</h2>
            <p class="lh-2">Auth and identity are complex and can take experienced developers months to build, test, and then maintain, especially if they aren't full-time security experts. This opens you to risk, and takes you away from building features that earn you money.</p>

            <p class="lh-2">FusionAuth installs in minutes on any platform, and integrates with any codebase or framework. You get all the features, security and performance you need for all your apps without lifting a finger. Here are a few reasons FusionAuth is better than rolling your own.</p>
