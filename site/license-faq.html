      <h2>License questions</h2>
      <h3>Answers to some commonly asked questions.</h3>
      <p>
        While the exact terms of your use of FusionAuth are spelled out in the <a href='https://fusionauth.io/license/'>license agreement</a> and you should definitely have your lawyer read it, we wanted to provide a more human readable version.
      </p>
      <p>
        (That said, if there is any conflict between this FAQ and the license agreement, the license agreement wins.)

            <h3 id="1">What does the FusionAuth license apply to?</h3>
            <p>
              The FusionAuth license applies to the FusionAuth bundle fusionauth-app which is used by all of our installation methods (ZIPs, DEBs, RPMs, Docker, K8s, etc).
            </p>
            <p>
              The fusionauth-search bundle is vanilla ElasticSearch, and is covered by the <a href='https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/LICENSE.txt'>version appropriate ElasticSearch license</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              All other code such as client libraries and example applications are covered under their own licenses, which are usually Apache 2.0. Refer to each project for the correct license.

            <h3 id="2">Do I have to pay you to use FusionAuth?</h3>
            <p>
              If you use the community edition, you typically wonâ€™t have to pay us. However, there are some scenarios where you need to have an agreement with us.

              You will need a reseller license for FusionAuth in order to resell it to your customers. This license is usually charged per customer rather than per monthly active user. You should contact our sales team to discuss licensing options. They can be reached at <a href="mailto:sales@fusionauth.io">sales@fusionauth.io</a>.

            <p>
              We have a standard DPA (Data Processing Addendum) we can provide. However, we only execute DPAs with Enterprise Edition customers with a contract in place. You should contact our sales team to discuss DPA options. They can be reached at <a href="mailto:sales@fusionauth.io">sales@fusionauth.io</a>.

              Besides a DPA, you can always reference our license and privacy policies in your documentation. Here are the URLs for those documents:

            <p>
              Custom contracts and legal reviews require various contract minimums. These include the fees and contract length. In most cases, we require a minimum of a 24-month agreement and fees of $15,000/month. We are happy to discuss your specific needs and figure out what will work in your budget.

              We know that companies often require in-depth on-boarding processes, including security audits. We are happy to work with you to complete these tasks, but we require contract minimums in order to do so. In most cases, we require a minimum of a 24-month agreement and fees of $15,000/month.

            <p>
              Nope. The source code for the fusionauth-app bundle and all closed source libraries owned by FusionAuth cannot be decompiled or reverse engineered. This prevents companies from forking FusionAuth and creating their own solution to sell to their customers (i.e. like Amazon has done with ElasticSearch).

            <p>
              We're more than happy to chat about this topic, but the rule of thumb is: if you have more than one production instance of FusionAuth and are charging money to access it, you are reselling and need a reseller's license.
            </p>
            <p>
	      A few examples of reselling: 
            </p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>
	        Managed applications, each running in a customer's data centers with FusionAuth as the auth system. 
	      </li>
	      <li>
	        An application running in a private cloud, with one instance of the application and FusionAuth per customer.
	      </li>
	    </ul>
            <p>
	      If you have one production instance and you are charging your users, you are not reselling FusionAuth. If you have multiple production instances cbut are not charging users for application access, you are not reselling either.
            </p>
            <p>
	      A few examples of what is <em>not</em> reselling: 
            </p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>
	        A SaaS application where users may create their own tenants in FusionAuth. Even if these customers then have customers of their own who are logging in using FusionAuth and are charging money, this is not reselling.
	      </li>
	      <li>
	        A consulting company who buys FusionAuth on behalf of customers and builds their custom applications on top of it. (<a href="/contact/">Contact us</a> if this is your situation, in certain situations we offer commissions if the customer purchases FusionAuth based on a recommendation.)
	      </li>
	    </ul>
            <p>

            <h3 id="22">How often is billing done?</h3>
            <p>
              We can bill month-to-month or annually, your choice. You can also sign a multi-year agreement if you'd like; please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> for more details.
            </p>
            <p>
              Month to month billing occurs on actual MAUs of the preceding month. If you have 10,000 MAUs one month, 30,000 the next and then 10,000 the third, you'd be billed for the MAU count for each month (10,000, then 30,000, then 10,000).
            </p>
            <p>
              If you'd like to be billed annually because you want a fixed monthly payment, we'll bill you on your estimated average MAUs. At the end of the year, we will settle up any differences from the estimate.

            <h3 id="23">How are monthly active users calculated?</h3>
            <p>
              Monthly active users (MAUs) are calculated and reported nightly. An MAU is someone that uses your application in some fashion during the course of a calendar month. This could be a user registering, logging in, or opening your app. MAUs don't include failed logins.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, if a user logs in 1,000 times during a month, they count as 1 MAU.

            <h3 id="24">I need to run my servers airgapped. How does licensing work in this scenario?</h3>
            <p>
              Since version 1.26, FusionAuth supports airgapped licensed deployments. You can install your license text in the administrative user interface or via the API. FusionAuth's advanced features will work without any internet access.
            </p>
            <p>
              One limitation is the breached password feature. This relies on network access in order to retrieve the database, and so cannot be fully functional in an airgapped environment.
