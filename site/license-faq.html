      <h2>License questions</h2>
      <h3>Answers to some commonly asked questions.</h3>
      <p>
        While the exact terms of your use of FusionAuth are spelled out in the <a href='https://fusionauth.io/license/'>license agreement</a> and you should definitely have your lawyer read it, we wanted to provide a more human readable version.
      </p>
      <p>
        (That said, if there is any conflict between this FAQ and the license agreement, the license agreement wins.)

            <h3 id="1">What does the FusionAuth license apply to?</h3>
            <p>
              The FusionAuth license applies to the FusionAuth bundle fusionauth-app which is used by all of our installation methods (ZIPs, DEBs, RPMs, Docker, K8s, etc).
            </p>
            <p>
              The fusionauth-search bundle is vanilla ElasticSearch, and is covered by the <a href='https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/LICENSE.txt'>version appropriate ElasticSearch license</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              All other code such as client libraries and example applications are covered under their own licenses, which are usually Apache 2.0. Refer to each project for the correct license.

            <h3 id="2">Do I have to pay you to use FusionAuth?</h3>
            <p>
              If you use the community edition, you typically won’t have to pay us. However, there are some scenarios where you need to have an agreement with us.

              You will need a reseller license for FusionAuth in order to resell it to your customers. This license is usually charged per customer rather than per monthly active user. You should contact our sales team to discuss licensing options. They can be reached at <a href="mailto:sales@fusionauth.io">sales@fusionauth.io</a>.

            <p>
              We have a standard DPA (Data Processing Addendum) we can provide. However, we only execute DPAs with Enterprise Edition customers with a contract in place. You should contact our sales team to discuss DPA options. They can be reached at <a href="mailto:sales@fusionauth.io">sales@fusionauth.io</a>.

            <p>
              Custom contracts and legal reviews require various contract minimums. These include the fees and contract length. In most cases, we require a minimum of a 24-month agreement and fees of $15,000/month. We are happy to discuss your specific needs and figure out what will work in your budget.

            <p>
              We know that companies often require in-depth on-boarding processes, including security audits. We are happy to work with you to complete these tasks, but we require contract minimums in order to do so. In most cases, we require a minimum of a 24-month agreement and fees of $15,000/month.

            <p>
              Nope. The source code for the fusionauth-app bundle and all closed source libraries owned by FusionAuth cannot be decompiled or reverse engineered. This prevents companies from forking FusionAuth and creating their own solution to sell to their customers (i.e. like Amazon has done with ElasticSearch).
