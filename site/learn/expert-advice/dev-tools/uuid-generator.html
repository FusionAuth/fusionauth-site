<h3>UUID Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<h4>What is a UUID?</h4>
<p>A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a string of characters that is used to uniquely identify an object. You may also see the term GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) which is also commonly used. Both UUIDs and GUIDs are generated according to a standard, using a combination of random numbers, timestamps and algorithms, all of which makes it extremely unlikely that two of them will be the same. 
</p>
<br>
<h4>What version UUID generator is this tool?</h4>
<p>This UUID generator generates a version 4 universally unique identifier. A version 4 UUID is made up of 32 hexadecimal digits (128 bits), divided into five groups separated by hyphens in this format: Xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.
</p>
<p>
The main advantage of version 4 UUIDs is that they are generated using random numbers, which makes it extremely unlikely that two UUIDs will be the same. The sheer number of possible outcome combinations (2^128) would make it nearly impossible to generate a duplicate for practical purposes.
</p>
<p>
This makes UUIDs useful for generating unique identifiers for objects in software programs, database records, and other situations where a unique identifier is needed.
</p>
<p>
There are other versions of UUIDs as well, including version 1 UUIDs, which are generated using the current time and the device's MAC address, and version 3 and version 5 UUIDs, which are generated using a hash function and a namespace identifier.
</p>

<h4>How does FusionAuth use UUIDs? </h4>
<p> In FusionAuth, UUIDs are used to identify users, applications, and other objects such as roles and groups. For example, when a new user or role is created, a UUID is generated and assigned to that user or role. This UUID can then be used to uniquely identify the user within the system, grant them appropriate resources, and it is used as a primary key in the database to store and retrieve user information. UUIDs are just one data type used in FusionAuth. To see the other data types you can use in FusionAuth, check out <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/reference/data-types#uuids">this documentation</a>.
