When using FusionAuth, when your user begins the authentication process, you typically send them to FusionAuth. FusionAuth authenticates them and returns them to your application with a token indicating the login was successful.

With this architecture:

* FusionAuth is the **only** system that sees confidential credentials such as passwords.
* You can add multi-factor authentication (MFA) and other security features in one place.
* Adding, removing and auditing users' application access occurs in FusionAuth.
* Pre-built functionality like registration, single sign-on, and profile management speeds application development.

FusionAuth is available both as an installable piece of software and a SaaS service, so you have options. The software functionality is the same no matter where you run it.
