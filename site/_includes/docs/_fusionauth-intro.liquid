When using FusionAuth, when your user logs in, you typically send them to FusionAuth. FusionAuth authenticates them and returns them to your application, with a valid token.

With this architecture:

* FusionAuth is the **only** system that sees confidential credentials such as passwords.
* You can add MFA and other security features in one place.
* Adding, removing and auditing application access occurs in one place.
* Pre-built functionality like registration, single sign-on, or profile management speeds application development.

FusionAuth is available both as an installable piece of software and a SaaS service, so you have options. The software functionality is the same no matter where you run it.
