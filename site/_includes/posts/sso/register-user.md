Next, register the user for the application. Navigate to the "Users" tab and find your user. Click on the black "Manage
User" button under the "Action" heading in the list. You'll end up at the details page:

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/includes/fusionauth/register-user.png" alt="The user details screen,
where you can register them." class="img-fluid" figure=true %}

Click "Add registration" to register the user in `your_application`.

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/includes/fusionauth/add-registration.png" alt="Adding the user
registration." class="img-fluid" figure=true %}

If users of this application have unique configuration details, such as a username, timezone, or languages, which are
different from the user's defaults, you could configure them here.

However, for this tutorial, you can click the blue "Save" button and accept the default values.
