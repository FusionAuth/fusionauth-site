### About {{page.feature}}

{{page.feature_intro}}

In this doc, you'll learn how to add {{page.feature}} functionality to your {{page.technology}} application. You'll use FusionAuth to easily add {{page.feature}}.

### 1. Configure FusionAuth

First, set up FusionAuth and a sample {{page.technology}} application. Please follow <a href="/docs/v1/tech/tutorials/integrate-{{page.technology_slug}}" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> to get that sample application set up.

All done? Great.

Let's get {{page.feature}} set up for your {{page.technology}} application.

### 2. Enable {{page.feature}}

Now, let's enable {{page.feature}} using FusionAuth. Create another FusionAuth script. To set up {{page.feature}}, all you need to do is tweak FusionAuth configuration.

Go back to the `fusionauth-setup` directory:

```
cd ../setup-fusionauth
```

You can use the same client library and API key as you used when setting up FusionAuth and the sample {{page.technology}} application. But here, you are configuring a different aspect, namely {{page.feature}}.

Put the below code in `{{page.feature_config_script_location}}`.

```{{page.code_language}}
{% remote_include page.feature_config_script_content_location %}
```

Run this code:

```shell
{{page.feature_config_command}}
```

You are all done! With this configuration code, you've enabled {{page.feature}} for your {{page.technology}} application.

#### Manual configuration of {{page.feature}}

You can also configure {{page.feature}} manually by logging into the FusionAuth admin user interface and {{page.feature_manual_navigation}}.

{%capture alt_content%}Manually setting up {{page.feature}}.{%endcapture%}
{% include _image.liquid src=page.admin_feature_image_file alt=alt_content class="img-fluid" figure=true %}

### 3. Test Out {{page.feature}}

Now, test to see that you have {{page.feature}} enabled for your application. Close any other incognito windows you have open and open a new one. (This ensures you've logged out of the application.)

Visit [the {{page.technology}} application]({{page.sample_app_url}}) and log in again.

Now, on the login page, you should see a {{page.feature_singular}} button.

{%capture alt_content%}What the user sees with {{page.feature}} enabled.{%endcapture%}
{% include _image.liquid src=page.user_feature_image_file alt=alt_content class="img-fluid" figure=true %}

This is the default look and feel, but you can [configure branding using themes](/docs/v1/tech/themes/).
