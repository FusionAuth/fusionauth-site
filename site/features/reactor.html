        <h2>Breached Password Detection</h2>
        <p>
          FusionAuth will check user login credentials against a set of leaked databases that we've collected from all over the Internet, even the hard to reach places. You can enable Breached Password Detection during account creation, password resets, password changes and login. You can then force the user to change their password or notify them of the breach via email.

        <h2>Advanced Registration Forms</h2><span class="orange stamp">NEW!</span>
        <p>
          You can build custom forms and perform complex validation during registration without writing any code. Our Advanced Registration Forms provides you the ability to collect custom user data during registration and store it within FusionAuth. 
        </p>
        <h4>Build Multi-Page Custom Forms</h4>
        <p>
          Use standard form fields like email, name, and password, or create your own. Custom fields are typed and can be strings, numbers, dates or booleans. You can also create multi-page registration forms, collecting different information on each page.

        <h2>LDAP Integration</h2><span class="orange stamp">NEW!</span>
        <p>
          Want to connect external data sources such as LDAP to FusionAuth? Now you can with Connectors. When you configure a Connector, the rules for how a user is authenticated are completely customizable. You can also configure user data migration rules on a per-Connector basis. 
        </p>
        <h4>Authenticate? Migrate? Why Not Both?</h4>
        <p>
          When a user is matched to a Connector, FusionAuth authenticates them against the external provider, allowing it to be the system of record. If configured, user information will be migrated from the external system into FusionAuth, allowing for a staged transition from legacy systems.
