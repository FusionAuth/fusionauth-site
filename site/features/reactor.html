        <p>
          FusionAuth will check user login credentials against a set of leaked databases that we've collected from all over the Internet, even the hard to reach places. You can enable Breached Password Detection during account creation, password resets, password changes and login. You can then force the user to change their password or notify them of the breach via email.

          Want to connect external data sources such as LDAP or a custom API to FusionAuth? Now you can with Connectors. When you configure a Connector, the rules for how a user is authenticated are completely customizable. You can also configure user data migration rules on a per-Connector basis.
