1. This is an attack vector where the attacker has stolen the user's refresh token. Here, the attacker requests the user's shopping cart with the stolen refresh token and an invalid session id
1. The application backend verifies the session id and realizes it is invalid. Since the attacker also sent across the refresh token, the application backend calls the JWT refresh API in FusionAuth with the refresh token
1. FusionAuth looks up the refresh token and returns a new JWT
1. The application backend receives the 200 from FusionAuth and creates a server-side session and stores the User object (or JWT) in it
1. The application backend uses the JWT to look up the user's shopping cart. It responds to the attacker with the user's shopping cart contents (usually as JSON). It also includes the new session id as a cookie that attacker can now use
