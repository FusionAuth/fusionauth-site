FusionAuth is proud to announce a breakthrough in user security, SimplePass&trade;. This new technology helps users around the world remember their passwords.

## The problem 

It's long been known that passwords are easily forgotten, frustrating to end users, and generally a huge PITA.

## The solution

The FusionAuth R&D team, with decades of experience in security and software development, saw a clear market opportunity and went to work.

"The feature is remarkably simple" said CTO Daniel DeGroff. "We ask the user for their email address, and then we show them their password. We can even help them enter the characters if they don't have a keyboard handy."

"After completing the initial prototype we looked at each other and said 'Holy $@%!, I can't believe nobody thought of this before'. I'll never forget it."

Understandably proud of the team and their recent breakthrough, DeGroff confidently added "We're disrupting passwords. I don't even know what that means, but I'm pretty sure that is what is happening."

CEO Brian Pontarelli was skeptical of the technology at first. However, when shown how easy it allowed him to log into his AOL.com account, he was blown away.

Said Pontarelli, "I thought Passwordless was the future, I suppose everyone did. But this is way simpler and way more secure. I mean, nothing is more secure than your eyes, and you have to use your eyes to read the password." 

Pontarelli went on to say "This technology is so important for the whole world. We are making the technology publicly available today and I will call it SimplePass&trade;, because it's so simple."

As part of the R&D process, extensive user experience testing was performed to validate the research. In one trial, FusionAuth presented two login forms to [Peter Starke, a systems analyst](https://www.theonion.com/most-popular-passwords-of-year-include-123456-password-1821529484). One was the typical username and password (boring) and the other used the SimplePass&trade; technology.

Peter was quick to choose the form with SimplePass&trade; technology stating "I mean, it types the password for me! Now I don't have to remember anything to log into my bank account. It's great! Maybe they could work on entering my email address, I'm always forgetting that too."

## Addressing some security "experts"

However, we'd like to address some criticism. Since the announcement, FusionAuth has come under fire from industry security experts. 

These "experts" state that this feature, while helpful to users and obviously beneficial to the login  experience, the technology could be exploited by experienced hackers.

Our reply: "Haters gonna hate. You don't know crap about security."
