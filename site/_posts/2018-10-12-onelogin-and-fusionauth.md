If you have any type of application, site or service, you already know that secure customer identity and access management (CIAM) is vital to register, authenticate, and manage your users. OneLogin and FusionAuth both have powerful identity solutions, but the way they approach the challenge makes their platforms very different. Understanding their unique perspectives can help clarify which one is a better match for your company's needs.

For example, you may have seen OneLogin talking about their recent integrations that leverage blockchain technology. This is exciting news for the identity management community, and we look forward to seeing if it will it be a mass-market hit, a niche-industry toolkit, or simply a bright flash in the identity management news cycle. A large corporation like OneLogin backed with millions in investor funding can take a risk with emerging technology like this, and work out how it fits into their product portfolio at a later time.

FusionAuth focuses on features and functionality we know our customers need. Our goal is to provide a streamlined platform designed to match a company's requirements without adding in unnecessary overhead. This contrast in perspective explains the differences between OneLogin and FusionAuth.

## What OneLogin and FusionAuth Have In Common

### As Many Users As You Can Get

OneLogin and FusionAuth both take advantage of OAuth tokens & API key management providing secure access for web and mobile applications. In addition, they are both web-scale applications designed to register and manage an unlimited number of users without a hiccup.

### Full-Featured Identity Tools

OneLogin and FusionAuth both provide the essential tools that modern identity management requires including multi-factor authentication (MFA), single sign-on (SSO) across multiple applications, and customizable communication templates. Both also provide user reports that any company needs to monitor their growth.

These are basic requirements of any CIAM, and take substantial time and money to develop in-house. A custom built authorization system also requires constant evaluation and maintenance as technology and security threats evolve, shifting valuable developer resources away from core application features that generate revenue. OneLogin and FusionAuth both eliminate this cost of development and maintenance providing long-term value to their clients.

While OneLogin and FusionAuth share these benefits over a custom solution, they differ in ways that can be vital to an organization and how they need to manage their users.

## How OneLogin and FusionAuth Are Different

### Free for Unlimited Users
One of the biggest differences between OneLogin and FusionAuth is cost. FusionAuth is free for unlimited users. No strings, gimmicks, or tricks. No cost increases when you hit a certain Monthly Active User threshold. Much like a database or a web server, secure authentication is so essential that developers should be able to implement it quickly and easily without cost concerns. And unlike the free options from other vendors, we don't feature-cripple or user-limit FusionAuth. You get the full unrestricted platform with every feature and benefit.

### Single-Tenant Security
Another difference between OneLogin and FusionAuth is that both of FusionAuth's local and cloud options are true single-tenant solutions. OneLogin has a solution that installs on-premise, but it still relies on being connected to their cloud for complete functionality. FusionAuth's solution can be 100% on-premise providing complete control of data storage locations and transmission pathways. FusionAuth also enables customers to implement a firewall at any layer, further protecting data from unauthorized access.

FusionAuth's single-tenant architecture allows for easier compliance with complex regulatory restrictions in many industries and countries. Germany's Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, Australia's Privacy Principles, Canada's PIPEDA, and most recently the European Union's GDPR all place different restrictions on how a user's personal data can be used and transmitted. FusionAuth provides the expanded control for companies required to comply with laws and regulations in their specific region.

### Configurable Password Encryption
Every application has different security requirements. Some need to be HIPAA compliant, while others can be less stringent. We let you pick the level of security you need, and adjust it as quickly as your needs or threats evolve, including using different password schemas for different groups of users. This can be a completely transparent process without any downtime or customer friction.

### Enterprise Identity Unification (EIU)
Another way OneLogin and FusionAuth differ is how they can handle complex bulk merger challenges. In today's fast-moving business world, companies merge with or acquire partners and competitors every day. It's a difficult challenge to combine and manage the unique databases of users that each company brings into the system. This is the realm of EIU and presents many complex issues such as duplicate users, incomplete or conflicting data, and varying password schemas.

FusionAuth allows a parent company to create unique tenants to isolate distinct datasets while still providing a single user management system for the overall organization. It gives the administrators incremental control over how and when the information is merged, and can even engage the users to manage, filter, and unify their own profile data.

### Custom Feature Development
Another difference between OneLogin and FusionAuth is our size and flexibility. OneLogin is a large company supported by millions in investor funding. At their size, it is difficult to provide custom features or functionality for smaller companies with unique or non-standard needs.

FusionAuth is a small, bootstrapped company dedicated to our customers. We have successfully provided our core solutions with unique customizations and one-on-one support for our clients. We have eliminated the overhead, complex approval pipelines, and corporate red-tape that cripples large firms so we can deliver exceptional solutions for clients like DataStax, StrategyCorp, Deutsche Bank and IBM. If you have a specific challenge for managing users that we don't already cover, we'll work with you for a solution. This is an added benefit to having a single-tenant solution: your system can be customized to fit your specific requirements and specifications.
