The recent announcement of [CVE-2022-22965](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22965), where "a Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux application running on JDK 9+ may be vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) via data binding," has some folks asking if FusionAuth is affected. This CVE is also known as the "Spring4Shell" vulnerability.

FusionAuth is not affected by this vulnerability in Spring. FusionAuth uses a different MVC framework, [Prime](https://github.com/prime-framework/prime-mvc), so there is no way that any FusionAuth applications could be compromised.
