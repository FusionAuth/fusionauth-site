FusionAuth is an excellent centralized identity management platform, if we do say so ourselves. In a [webinar tomorrow](https://get.hypr.com/fusionauth-webcast), I'll be walking through how to set up single sign-on authentication between Zendesk, the popular customer support platform, and FusionAuth. In under 10 minutes, you'll see how easy it is to configure Zendesk to use SAML to integrate with FusionAuth.

If you were to continue this pattern with multiple applications, such as GSuite or a custom web application, users could sign into your entire suite of tools, both COTS and custom, with one username and password. [This architecture](/blog/2020/07/08/auth-and-the-bottleneck-architecture) also allows for operational efficiencies since all users are managed in a single store.

## Single Sign-on with HYPR's True Passwordless&trade; MFA

But wait, there's more!

To top it off, we'll be adding HYPR as an identity provider in the webinar. This will allow a user to authenticate using [HYPR's True Passwordless&trade; MFA](https://www.hypr.com/true-passwordless-mfa/). Any authorized user will then be able to access their applications in an easy, secure way. 

After that, we'll take questions.

If you'd like to see how easy it is to configure FusionAuth to serve as an centralized authentication and authorization service, HYPR and FusionAuth are hosting a webinar on Thursday, July 16 2020.
