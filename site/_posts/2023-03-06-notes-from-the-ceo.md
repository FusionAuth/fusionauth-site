When Daniel and I launched FusionAuth 4.3 years ago, we realized that we had a passion for creating tools that developers love. It was less about the specific features the tool had, but more about the technology that we used to solve problems. Honestly, we could have as easily written any developer tool, as long as we got to improve on everything as we went and write some awesome code.

A lot of companies will find an industry, build a product, and then sell it aggressively with the goal of growing from $0 to $1B valuation (or some other monetary goal). Sure, we live in a world where money is important, but this approach can de-emphasize the technology at the expense of money. In fact, the technology can be mostly spaghetti code and buggy, but if the sales team sells it, they will be winning. Just look at all the software out there that people are constantly complaining about. It's possible to sell poorly written software and make a ton of money.

But where's the fun in that? And how does that improve developers lives? And how does it improve the technology landscape for the future developers that are just joining the workforce or will be over the next 10 years?

We decided that equally important as growth and profits are, is the technology and the developers that use it.

Last year we struggled to maintain the notion that we exist to support developers. We lost sight of our developer roots and started to drift a bit more towards the structured corporate side of the industry. Lots of things changed including our website, our branding, our messaging, and our approach to growth. To some degree, our community and the free version of our product became less of a focus as we tried to growth quickly.

While we succeeded in our growth plans and had the best year in company history, something was missing. 

## Plans for 2023

This year we've decided to get back to basics and re-embrace our developer roots. You might have already noticed that our website is slowly changing. We are changing our messaging back so that it tells developers what we actually do (plus we are going a bit darker with our colors as well ðŸ˜Ž).

We've also launched a new free trial. Now you can test out FusionAuth with a free Starter license and a Basic deployment in FusionAuth Cloud. This is still a 14-day free trial, but later this year we are hoping to launch a completely free tier of FusionAuth Cloud as well.

We are launching a new React SDK and a simpler method of getting FusionAuth running. Soon, you'll be able to install FusionAuth locally, install the React SDK, and be up and running in literally minutes.

We launched our Digital Ocean Marketplace listing that will make it simple to run FusionAuth on DO. We are excited to see what the passionate community Digital Ocean has built creates on top of FusionAuth. And to expand our partnership with Digital Ocean in the future to make it even simpler to use FusionAuth.

Our AWS Marketplace is coming soon as well. The initial launch will allow customers to include FusionAuth on their AWS bill. We'll also be launching additional AWS integrations this year as well.

We've got a lot more coming this year as well. Join our mailing list to get updates about everything we are building.

Thanks and happy coding!
