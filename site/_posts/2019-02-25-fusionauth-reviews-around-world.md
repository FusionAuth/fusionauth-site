It's been only a few months since we launched FusionAuth and the reviews are coming in from all over. So far, developers are loving it! What's not to love? We designed FusionAuth to deploy in seconds, integrate with any codebase, and run anywhere on any platform.

While we knew we built a solution developers needed, we didn't expect to cover so much of the planet so quickly. Since September 1 we have had over 40,000 downloads from companies and developers on six continents and in almost every timezone. Take a look at this map of where FusionAuth is being used.

Those dots aren't individual instances by the way, those are cities, so each dot represents many instances. FusionAuth gets shared and recommended through developer groups fast, so when one company starts using it, we see more interest from the region. It's even more exciting when we get comments like:

**"Great tool, just the right features."**<br>
_Chris O., CEO of Betty Blocks_

And one of our favorites:

**"I am blown away by FusionAuth. You just saved us $800-$1500 per month from Auth0 pricing. They're gonna hate you."**<br>
_Mirza F._
