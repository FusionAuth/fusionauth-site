## Monday's DevTools Session
We start off the week on a panel of distinguished developers discussing how to launch, scale and manage custom developer tools. Join us and representatives of CircleCI, HashiCorp, Workday, Backstop, and Drud Technology to learn about the possibilities and pitfalls of building tools that developers need to succeed.  We'll even buy you lunch! [Get all the details here](https://sched.co/NNY7).

If you can't make the session, you can find us later in the evening for the [New to Boulder Dinner](https://sched.co/NNhe) at the [Trident Cafe](https://www.tridentcafe.com/) or at the [BSW Opening Party](https://sched.co/O6Gk) at Galvanize Boulder.

## Wednesday at Ignite Boulder
Wednesday brings us to the largest Ignite event in the world, [Ignite Boulder](https://igniteboulder.com/). Started in 2008, Ignite Boulder has sold out 36 times and promises presentations that inspire, entertain, and educate viewers on just about any topic imaginable. We'll be sponsoring the event and providing the first round (or two) of drinks, so make sure you get there early. We'll have more chances to enter to win that Nintendo Switch available, so look for the FusionAuth team and we'll get you set up.

## Friday is Boomtown Demo Day
Startup Week wouldn't be complete without a solid line up of entrepreneurs ready to present their best pitches, and the Boomtown Accelerator is ready to deliver. [Get to this keynote](https://sched.co/NNXy) to see fresh founders pitch their creative solutions and explain how their businesses can change your world. Make sure you are there by 4pm just in case you are the winner of the Nintendo Switch prize bundle including travel case and Super Mario Odyssey game!

## Tons of BSW Sessions
Of course BSW isn't about us, it's about an amazing community that shares a common goal: to imagine and build exciting, valuable, and successful companies. Take the time to browse through this incredible lineup of sessions covering Startup Strategies, Design & Development, the budding Cannabis Industry, Energy Science, Robotics and so much more. [Check out the full schedule here](https://boulderstartupweek2019.sched.com/).
