Growing is painful, and building an engineering team is hard. There are many reasons for this, and one of them is attrition. In this article I'll talk about my pain and suffering related to attrition while building FusionAuth.

### Statistics

The average tenure of a software engineer varies. Interestingly, tenure may be lowest in the largest tech companies such as Google and Amazon.

One report shows an average tenure in big tech is between 1.1 and 3.2 years.[^1] The US Bureau of Labor and Statistics report a nationwide average of 3.8 to 4.3 years which is not limited to the software industry.[^2] Regardless of which statistic you use, it is hard to argue that average tenure in big tech is short, and almost certainly lower than the average across all sectors.

### Bye, Felisha

Switching jobs means new experiences, more money and a change of scenery. This can be very appealing early in your career and can help you level up quickly.

The downside is that you rarely develop the same level of experiences and skill that you would by sticking around, learning to work through conflict, mastering a code base, and learning how to stay productive in spite of company politics.

Unfortunately this doesn't seem to be the sentiment shared by many engineers. 

### The problem

By the time an employee is beginning to produce and become competent - they have one foot out the door looking for their next adventure. 

There are various ways to overcome this problem.

The first is to hire many engineers at once. Using this strategy, even if a few leave, there is nearly always overlap in tenure so that the combined skills on the team never go to zero.

Hiring in bulk is not always possible, and it hasn't been for us for many years. Engineering salaries are high so this requires plenty of capital. 

At FusionAuth, we've taken a different path. We've never taken capital, we've built a profitable business w/out debt. We hire when we can afford to do so.

Hiring slow, means we may only be able to afford to hire a new engineer every 12-18 months. If the average tenure is less than your hiring cadence as - you'll never get ahead of the attrition curve. This is the experience I've had with growing a team slowly.

It is sort of like filling a tub without plugging the drain. Unless you have a really big hose , the tub will drain faster than you can fill it. It is just difficult to get ahead, and you end up cold and naked in the tub. Admittedly the analogy does fall apart a bit.   

But the end result is that it leaves the technical founders picking up the slack and working long hours to fill in the gaps. This cycle repeats and can become demoralizing when the time and effort that is spent transferring the skills necessary to continue and grow the business are never preserved.

### Light at the end of the tunnel

Thankfully, we have turned the corner on this issue and begun to dig our way out of the hole. As FusionAuth has continued to grow, we can now afford to pay competitive salaries, and we also have enough revenue to hire in bulk. We just hired four experienced engineers in December! Sort of an early Christmas present to the company. 

Hiring more than one engineer at a time is helpful in several ways.

The first is that the new team feels a sense of camaraderie as they all start from "zero" together. They do not have to compare their skill set or knowledge of the product with someone that has been working in the space for 10 years, and instead can compare to another that is starting from the same place at the same time.

The second - which is most exciting to me - is that we are now filling the tub four times as fast!
