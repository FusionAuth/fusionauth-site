FusionAuth, the authentication and authorization platform built for developers, today announced it has received its SOC 2 Type 2 certification. Achieving SOC 2 Type 2 compliance, which is focused on the security of an organization’s systems, illustrates to customers that FusionAuth is maintaining its adherence to one of the most stringent, industry-accepted auditing standards for service companies. FusionAuth, which was launched in 2018, achieved its SOC 2 Type 2 certification very early in its company lifecycle because it was focused on governance, risk and compliance practices since its inception.

“We founded FusionAuth on security, so we were able to skip the SOC 2 Type 1 audit and leapfrog to SOC 2 Type 2 very quickly,” said Brian Pontarelli, founder and co-CTO of FusionAuth. “It is important for us to support our customers however they need and provide them with the best security possible. Achieving SOC 2 Type 2 illustrates our dedication to that goal. We’re already looking forward to other standards, such as ISO 27001, that we can secure to support our customers even more.”

FusionAuth’s IAM platform was built with developers in mind and is API-first, meaning that developers are able to easily integrate its robust authorization and authentication features such as OAuth, OpenID Connect, and SAML directly into the products they build. The company continually innovates, bringing unique features to market that are easy for developers to add. In recent months, the company has launched its Entity Management, Multi-Factor Authentication, Advanced Threat Detection, and Enterprise Kubernetes Management features.
