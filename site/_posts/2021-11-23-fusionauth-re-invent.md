AWS re:Invent is one of the largest technical conferences. In the cloud space, it is the go-to event. In 2019, there were north of 50,000 attendees; this year the number of attendees is lower, but there'll still be a lot of folks in Las Vegas, NV the week after Thanksgiving. The FusionAuth team will be among them, and we'd love to see you.

We're going to re:Invent for many reasons. Both FusionAuth and our clients often develop and deploy on the public AWS cloud. Some use vanilla EC2 instances with RDS, others deploy on solutions like EKS and Fargate (yes, [FusionAuth supports Kubernetes](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/kubernetes/fusionauth-deployment/)). re:Invent is an opportunity to meet fellow developers, both during talks and in the everpresent hallway track. We look forward to exchanging AWS knowledge and ideas.

We're also excited to chat with attendees. The AWS CIAM solution, [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), has some issues (as [some in the FusionAuth community](/blog/2020/11/18/reconinfosec-fusionauth/) have shared). We'd like to hear from developers who are current Cognito users and are considering other solutions, such as FusionAuth. Migrating away from Cognito isn't straightforward, but there are ways.

We're also looking forward to specific sessions. I personally am excited about "What's new is Amazon RDS", "Creating the best developer experience" and "Deep dive into high performance networking on AWS". While many session videos are pushed to the Amazon Web Services Youtube Channel (here's a favorite of mine from recent years: [Becoming an AWS Policy Ninja using AWS IAM and AWS Organizations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hETtXCqX_Zc)), I find the in-person experience to be superior in a number of ways.

Of course, it isn't all educational talks. There's also fun to be had. One activity worth attending is [Corey Quinn's nature walk](https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1461533923855331329) where he skewers Expo vendors. There are numerous parties. If you registered, chances are at least one vendor has emailed you with an invite. This twitter account, [@reInventParties](https://twitter.com/reInventParties/), is another way to discover them. Finally, someone recommended getting into nature and checking out [Red Rock Canyon](https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/nevada/red-rock-canyon).

If you want to meet up with the FusionAuth team at re:Invent, we'd love to see you. Find us in a couple of places:

* We're having an [TopGolf party on Monday](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/aws-reinvent-kickoff-party-with-fusionauth-at-topgolf-tickets-186103098377). It's currently full, but please join the waitlist.
* We have a booth right across from the Developer Lounge in the Expo hall. There's no map for the 2021 re:Invent Expo yet, but [here's the page](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/learn/expo/). Brave the madness and come say hi for a demo, to chat about the intricacies of the Authorization Code grant, or to sign up for a couple of giveaways.
* Finally, we'll be out and about as well. Send us a note via our [contact form](/contact/) or tweet/DM a team member active on Twitter: [Dan](https://twitter.com/mooreds), [Akira](https://twitter.com/theakirati), [Brian](https://twitter.com/bpontarelli), or [Daniel](https://twitter.com/robotdan220). We'd love to hear from you.

Happy re:Inventing!
