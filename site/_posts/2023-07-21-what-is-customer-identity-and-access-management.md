Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) is a set of processes and technologies that organizations use to manage the identities and access of their customers. CIAM solutions help organizations securely authenticate and authorize customers, protect customer data, and provide a seamless customer experience.

## What is CIAM?

CIAM is similar to Identity and Access Management (IAM) but is solves the problems of a different audience: customers rather than employees. CIAM solutions help organizations:

* Secure customer identities. CIAM solutions protect customer identities from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. This can be done through the use of strong authentication methods, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), and other security measures, such as password policies and session management.
* Provide a seamless customer experience. CIAM solutions improve the customer experience by making it easier for customers to sign up, log in, and access services. CIAM solutions provide a single sign-on (SSO) experience by allowing customers to register and log in using social or federated user accounts. CIAM systems also provide self-service tools for managing customer profiles.
* Gather customer data. CIAM solutions allow organizations to gather customer data, such as contact information, preferences, and purchase history. This data can be used to improve the customer experience, to target marketing campaigns, and to make better business decisions. This data can be gathered for both paying customers and free users.

### Benefits to using CIAM solutions

* Improved security. CIAM solutions secure customer identities and data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. This reduces the risk of fraud, data breaches, and other security incidents.
* Enhanced customer experience. CIAM solutions improve the customer experience and make it simple for customers to sign up, log in, and access online services. Doing so leads to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.
* Increased business agility. CIAM solutions help organizations be more agile by making it easier to onboard new customers, launch new products and services, and respond to changing customer demands.
* Reduced costs. CIAM solutions reduce costs by streamlining customer onboarding and support processes, thereby reducing the need for manual intervention.

### Customer experience

One of the key benefits of CIAM solutions is that they can help to improve the customer experience. As mentioned, CIAM solutions can make it easier for customers to sign up, log in, and access services. This leads to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.

CIAM solutions can:

* Offer a single sign-on (SSO) solution, which allows customers to sign in to multiple applications with a single set of credentials.
* Allow customers to register and log in using social accounts, such as Facebook, Apple, or Google.
* Provide self-service tools for managing profiles.
* Let customers to undertake account security and recovery actions, such as adding MFA or resetting a password.
* Personalize the customer experience based on customer preferences.

### User experience

The user experience (UX) of a CIAM solution is also important. A good UX will make it easy for customers to use the solution and improve the overall customer experience.

There are a number of factors that can affect the UX of a CIAM solution. These factors include:

* The design of the user interface (UI).
* The use of clear and concise language.
* Helpful error messages.
* The ability to customize the solution to meet the specific needs of the organization. These include user interface speed, device-based responsive design, and localization (if targeting other countries or users speaking other languages).

### Apps

CIAM solutions can also be used to improve the security and usability of applciation. For example, CIAM solutions can be used to:

* Implement MFA for app login without requiring changes to the application.
* Restrict app access to authorized users.
* Allow other login methods, such as social sign-on or passkeys.
* Collect user data for analytics purposes.
* Personalize the app experience based on user preferences and consents.

## What is the difference between CIAM and IAM?

Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) and Identity Access Management (IAM) are both related to identity and access management, but they have different focuses. CIAM manages identities and access of customers and users, while IAM focuses on managing identities and access of employees.

These areas of focus lead to a number of differences between CIAM and IAM systems.

* Audience: CIAM is focused on managing the identities and access of external users, such as customers, users, partners, and suppliers. IAM is focused on managing the identities and access of internal users, such as employees and contractors.
* Scope: CIAM typically covers a wider range of activities than IAM. In addition to authentication and authorization, CIAM may also include activities such as identity proofing, account provisioning, and user management. IAM typically focuses on authentication and authorization.
* Security requirements: IAM typically has more stringent security requirements than CIAM. This is because of the negative ramifications of a compromised employee account.

CIAM and IAM are both important flavors of identity and access management. However, they have different focuses and requirements.

## What are the essential elements of CIAM?

There are a number of essential elements for a successful CIAM solution. These elements include:

* Scalability: CIAM solutions need to be able to scale to handle large numbers of users. This is especially important for businesses that have a large customer base or that expect to see significant growth in the number of users.
* Privacy: CIAM solutions need to protect customer data. This includes data such as names, addresses, email addresses, and passwords. CIAM solutions should use industry-standard security measures to protect customer data, such as encryption, hashing and access control.
* Functionality: CIAM solutions need to provide a wide range of features. These features should include registration, login, password management, account recovery, and role-based access control (RBAC). CIAM solutions should also be able to integrate with other applications and systems, such as CRM systems and e-commerce platforms.
* Extensibility: CIAM solutions need to be able to be extended to meet the specific needs of an organization. This means that the solution should be flexible enough to be customized to the specific requirements of the organization. Including the ability to add [application specific themes](/docs/v1/tech/themes/application-specific-themes), where the styling and branding match the application.
* APIs & Integrations: CIAM solutions need to be able to integrate with other applications and systems. This allows the solution to be used to improve the security and user experience of other applications.
* Adaptability: CIAM solutions encounter peaks and valleys of usage over time, depending on the customer journey
* Self-service: Both because of scaling and long lag times between users interacting with the CIAM system, the ability for users to manage their own user data, credentials and authentication methods is unique to CIAM systems.

In addition to these essential elements, there are a number of other factors that organizations should consider when choosing a CIAM solution. These include the cost of the solution, the ease of use, and the level of support that is offered.

## What are the common authentication elements in CIAM?

One of the key components of a CIAM system is authentication. Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity. There are a number of different authentication methods that can be used in CIAM, including:

* Passwords: Passwords are the most common form of online authentication. However, passwords can be easily guessed or stolen, so they are not always the most secure option.
* Single sign-on (SSO): SSO allows users to log in to multiple applications with a single set of credentials. SSO can help to simplify the login process and improve the user experience.
* Social login: Social login allows users to log in to applications using their social media accounts. Social login can make the login process easier and more convenient for users.
* Passwordless authentication: Rather than a specific method, passwordless authentication applies to any method that does not require users to enter a password.
* Passkeys: Passkeys do not require users to enter a password. This is also known as WebAuthn. Passkey authentication is a promising new security method that can help organizations improve the security and user experience of their applications.
* Magic Link: Magic link authentication is a passwordless authentication method that uses one-time links sent to a user's email address to authenticate them. Also probably my favorite because it has the word magic in it (oh and it is easy to use).

### Multi-Factor Authentication

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is requires users to provide two or more pieces of evidence to authenticate themselves. This can include a password, a one-time code, or a biometric identifier. MFA is a more secure form of authentication than passwords alone because it makes it more difficult for attackers to gain access to user accounts.

There are a number of different MFA methods that can be used, including:

* SMS-based MFA: This method sends a one-time code to the user's mobile phone.
* Email-based MFA: This method sends a one-time code to the user's email address.
* Push notification-based MFA: This method sends a notification to the user's mobile device.
* Biometric MFA: This method requires users to provide a biometric identifier, such as a fingerprint or facial scan.

See what [Muti-Factor Authentication](https://fusionauth.io/articles/authentication/multi-factor-authentication) FusionAuth offers.

### Single Sign-On

Single sign-on (SSO) is a security feature that allows users to log in to multiple applications with a single set of credentials. SSO can help to simplify the login process and improve the user experience.

### Social Login

Social login is a security feature that allows users to log in to applications using their social media accounts. Social login can make the login process easier and more convenient for users.

There are a number of different social login methods that can be used, including:

* Facebook login
* Google login
* Instagram login
* TikTok login
* Twitter login
* WeChat login. WeChat is primarily used in China.
* Xing login. Xing is primarily used in Germany. 

There may be other social providers in your geography. Ask your teenager.

### Passwordless

Passwordless authentication is a security method that does not require users to enter a password. Instead, users can authenticate themselves using a variety of methods, such as one-time codes, biometrics, or physical keys.

Here are some of the benefits of using passwordless authentication:

* Increased security: Passwordless authentication is more secure than traditional password-based authentication because it eliminates the need for users to remember and enter passwords.
* Improved user experience: Passwordless authentication can improve the user experience by making it easier and faster for users to log in.
* Reduced IT costs: Passwordless authentication can reduce IT costs by eliminating the need to manage and reset passwords.

Here are some of the methods that can be used for passwordless authentication:

* One-time codes: One-time codes are short, randomly generated codes that are sent to the user's device. The user must enter the code to authenticate themselves.
* Biometrics: Biometrics are physical characteristics that can be used to authenticate users, such as fingerprints, facial scans, or voiceprints.
* Physical keys: Physical keys can be used to authenticate users by inserting them into a device or by tapping them against a sensor.

### Magic Link

Magic link authentication is a passwordless authentication method that uses one-time links sent to a user's email address to authenticate them. Users receive an email with a link that expires after a certain amount of time. When they click on the link, they are automatically logged in to the application.

Magic link authentication is a more secure alternative to traditional password-based authentication because it eliminates the need for users to remember and enter passwords. It is also more convenient for users because they do not have to enter their email address and password every time they want to log in.

Here are some of the benefits of using magic link authentication:

* Increased security: Magic link authentication is more secure than traditional password-based authentication because it eliminates the need for users to remember and enter passwords. Possession of the link is enough.
* Improved user experience: Magic link authentication can improve the user experience by making it easier and faster for users to log in.
* Reduced IT costs: Magic link authentication can reduce IT costs by eliminating the need to manage and reset passwords.

Here are some of the ways that magic link authentication works:

1. When a user wants to log in to an application that supports magic link authentication, they enter their email address.
2. The application sends a one-time link to the user's email address.
3. The user clicks on the link and is automatically logged in to the application.
