To use a Generic Connector:

* Build a Generic Connector API endpoint in your application which exposes your user data.
* Configure the Connector in [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Connectors#, including securing the endpoint.
* Add the Connector Policy in [breadcrumb]#Tenants -> Your Tenant -> Connectors# to configure to which users the connector applies.


=== Request

The request will be delivered as JSON.

=== Response

Your API should return a valid JSON user object with status code 200 if the user is found and authenticated. Note that while you may return all the attributes of the user object, only the required ones must be returned.

If the user cannot be authenticated, you should return the appropriate status code and response data as documented by the link:../apis/login[Login API].
