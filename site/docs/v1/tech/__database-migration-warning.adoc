*Database migration*

The database schema has changed and an upgrade is required for this version of FusionAuth. While in development mode you will prompted to upgrade the database by maintenance mode before you may login. In a production runtime with silent configuration, the upgrade will occur automatically during startup.

See link:/docs/v1/tech/admin-guide/upgrade#database[Database Upgrades] for more information about database migrations.
