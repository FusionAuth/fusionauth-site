== Overview

If any problems arise or if you are unable to access FusionAuth, consult the FusionAuth log files. In most cases API errors will be written out to the `fusionauth-app.log` file, but for some installations such as Docker, the errors will be sent to `stdout`.

If you need further assistance, please ask a question in the https://fusionauth.io/community/forum/[FusionAuth forum, window="_blank"] or open an issue on https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/new/choose[Github, window="_blank"] if you have found a bug (please provide replication steps).

If you have a paid edition which includes support you may open a support request from your https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/[FusionAuth Account, window="_blank"] page. Learn more about link:/pricing/[purchasing support].

== Logs

=== System Log UI

The system logs may be reviewed in the FusionAuth admin UI by navigating to [breadcrumb]#System -> Logs#.  This feature was added in version 1.16.0. This UI will only render logs for systems that write their logs out to disk.  Deployments which write logs to STDOUT, such is the case with Docker, will not be able to review logs through this interface.

The system log UI organizes and renders the most recent 64KB of all logs for all nodes in the deployment.  If you need the entire log, use the download action in the upper-right hand corner of UI to download a zip of all logs.

image::troubleshooting/system-logs-multiple-nodes.png[System Logs - Multiple Nodes,width=1200]

=== Filesystem Logs

Alternatively, the logs may be accessed directly.  The following are the default locations for each of the FusionAuth log files. You may or may not have all of the FusionAuth services installed for your system, so you may not have all of the following logs on your server.

[source,shell]
.Linux and macOS
----
/usr/local/fusionauth/logs/fusionauth-app.log
/usr/local/fusionauth/logs/fusionauth-search.log
----

These paths assume the suggested product location of `\fusionauth`. This path may be different on your system depending on where you unpacked the zip files.

[source]
.Windows
----
\fusionauth\logs\fusionauth-app.log
\fusionauth\logs\fusionauth-search.log
----

Note that if you started Windows via Fast Path, the `fusionauth-app.log` file will not be created. Instead the services are running interactively and all logging is written to to stdout.

=== Event Log

[NOTE.since]
====
Available since 1.6.0
====

The event log is a FusionAuth message store designed to capture different types of events that may be necessary to communicate to a FusionAuth developer or admin user.

The event log may contain helpful details to indicate the cause of the failure, or a failure condition you need to be aware of in FusionAuth. See [breadcrumb]#System -> Event Log#.

While not limited to, generally speaking the event log will contain events or errors related to external systems or asynchronous issues that are difficult to communicate to the API caller or the FusionAuth admin at runtime. While not intended to be an exhaustive list, examples of these types of errors are:

- SMTP connection issues
- Lambda invocation errors
- External identity provider failures or configuration issues
- Failure to deliver a webhook event

== Enabling Debugging

=== Functionality specific

Many features have additional debugging that can be enabled via the administrative user interface or the API. These features include, but are not limited to:

* Identity Providers
* Application SAML IdP configuration
* Connectors

If you are having issues with certain functionality, look for a [field]#Debug enabled# checkbox in the user interface. If present, set it to true.

image::troubleshooting/generic-connector-debug-enabled.png[Enabling debugging for a generic connector,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

The additional debugging information will be written to the <<Event Log>>.

=== Enabling JMX

link:https://openjdk.java.net/groups/jmx/[JMX] is an API which allows deeper insight into and monitoring of Java applications, including FusionAuth. To use JMX, you’ll need to include a few modules:

* `jdk.management.agent`
* `jdk.httpserver` if you are using the JMX http adapter

These should be part of a recent, standard Java install. However, if you are using the Docker image, which is built with jlink, you'll need to build a new image with these modules. There's a link:https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/issues/70[GitHub issue about adding these modules to the FusionAuth image].

When the above modules are available to your Java runtime, configure JMX by passing additional arguments to FusionAuth using any of the supported link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/configuration/[configuration options] such as adding a `fusionauth-app.additional-java-args` entry to the `fusionauth.properties` file.

== Troubleshooting Two Factor Authentication

If you are receiving an invalid code for your two factor authentication and you are using a link:/docs/v1/tech/tutorials/two-factor/authenticator-app/[time based one time password (TOTP) application such as Google Authenticator or Authy], confirm that the system time is correct on the server.

The TOTP two factor auth system is time dependent and if there is any slippage between the system time of the client and the system time of the server, the generated code will not be correct. This is also known as "clock skew".

The fix is to ensure that the FusionAuth server has the correct system time. How exactly do that that depends on the type of system; please consult your operating system documentation.

== Troubleshooting Database Connections

If you find that FusionAuth is unable to connect to the database, ensure you are able to use a command line client connection to successfully make a connection using the same port and credentials.

Some MySQL services such as Microsoft Azure may require a specific version of TLS to connect successfully. At the time of writing this note, the MySQL connector will not attempt to utilize TLSv1.2 by default, so when connecting to a service that requires this version you will need to explicitly request this version of TLS on the connection string. For example, appending this `enabledTLSProtocols=TLSv1.2` to the connection string will allow you to successfully connect to an Azure managed MySQL database. See https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/8.0/en/connector-j-reference-using-ssl.html[MySQL Connector : Connecting Securely Using SSL] for additional information.

== Troubleshooting Performance

If you are not seeing the logins per second you'd expect from FusionAuth, you can take some steps to troubleshoot the issue. Generally speaking the primary bottleneck for logins per second is CPU. Hashing the password is intentionally slow. FusionAuth will not be able to perform more logins per second than your CPU can handle. The database is the other likely bottleneck.

One way to identify if the password hashing is the bottleneck in load tests is to reduce the hash strength. See [breadcrumb]#Tenants -> Edit -> Password -> Cryptographic hash settings#. Set this to Salted MD5 with a factor of 1 and then enable Re-hash on login. This will cause each user to have their password re-hashed next time they login to use MD5. Salted MD5 is *not* a good password hashing strategy for a number of reasons, but is useful to test whether your system is CPU bound. Make sure you switch back after testing is done.

If you can still get a lower number of logins per second than you'd expect with this configuration, then the database is likely the bottleneck and you should update your system to use a database with more resources and load test that system.

If the MD5 configuration allows you to achieve a much higher logins per second, then the CPU is your bottleneck. If you are CPU bound, the only way to get more logins per second is to horizontally scale (add more nodes) or vertically scale (use larger CPUs with each node).


== Troubleshooting Uninstall-Upgrade-Reinstall.

[WARNING]
====
This will completely remove FusionAuth App and FusionAuth Search from your installation. +
Proceed with caution.
====

=== The Nuclear Option icon:radiation-alt[type="fas"]

If you are looking to set up, to set up a clean install (scorched earth):

==== RPM

To set up a `clean install` (scorched earth):

===== Remove Packages Manually

1.  Remove the RPM package for `fusionauth-search` and `fusionauth-app`
- `sudo rpm -e fusionauth-search`
- `sudo rpm -e fusionauth-app`

1. Manually delete anything left over from RPM
- `sudo rm -rf /usr/local/fusionauth/fusionauth-search/`
- `sudo rm -rf /usr/local/fusionauth/fusionauth-app/`

1. Note, this will leave:
- `/usr/local/fusionauth/config`
- `/usr/local/fusionauth/data`
- `/usr/local/fusionauth/java`
- `/usr/local/fusionauth/bin` (if it exists)
- `/usr/local/fusionauth/java` (is also safe to delete, but is not necessary)

1. Run a re-install with the `-s` option enabled on FastPath (see warning regarding production below).  This will reinstall Elasticsearch in additional to FusionAuth.
- `sh -c "curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-install/master/install.sh | sh -s - -s"`

1. This should leave you with a clean install preserving:
- The FusionAuth config file found in `/usr/local/fusionauth/config/fusionauth.properties`
- The Elasticsearch index found in `/usr/local/fusionauth/data`

[WARNING]
====
As noted elsewhere, it is recommended users not use our FastPath Install Scripts in production.

These scripts are wrappers for our link:/direct-download[direct download packages].  When installed directly, there is:

- Greater control over how FusionAuth is installed
- Greater control over the roles/users/permissions assigned to FusionAuth packages
- Greater likelihood of a 'clean' uninstall/upgrade with a package manager (rpm/deb)
====


== Common Errors

=== Access Denied

If you see an Access Denied error in your browser while using the FusionAuth UI, this could be caused by a mis-configured CDN or proxy. This error often produces a 4xx error code such as a 403. In order to fix this issue, ensure that your CDN, proxy or gateway does not prevent traffic from flowing directly to FusionAuth. FusionAuth is able to handle all HTTP traffic and any network handling between the browser and FusionAuth should be as simple as possible.

=== FusionAuth Stops Unexpectedly

If you are running FusionAuth on a server with limited memory, it may stop unexpectedly. This can also happen when there are many other applications competing for memory on the server.

When FusionAuth is killed because of an out of memory issue (OOM), it dies with no explanation in the FusionAuth logs. You might see lines like this in server system logs (typically under `/var/log/`):

```
Dec 30 12:00:38 vps kernel: Out of memory: Kill process 30047 (java) score 98 or sacrifice child
```

The OOM killer will begin killing services once the kernel runs out of memory. The solution will be to allocate less memory to FusionAuth or to increase the amount of RAM available.

You can do the former with the `fusionauth-app.memory` setting. See the link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/configuration/[configuration reference] for more details.

You may do the latter by running a larger server or running fewer competing applications. In particular, applications used by FusionAuth such as Elasticsearch or the database may be moved off to external servers.

=== MapperParsingException

If you are using the Elasticsearch search engine, attributes in the `user.data` and `registration.data` are indexed for you. The data fields can contain arbitrary JSON objects.

If your user search is failing mysteriously and you see an error like this one in your system logs:

```
org.elasticsearch.index.mapper.MapperParsingException: failed to parse field [data.field] of type [text] in document with id 'b8f1ad7d-def0-48d1-a983-aeabf0122b90'. Preview of field's value: '{bar=123}'
```

or
```
org.elasticsearch.index.mapper.MapperParsingException: Could not dynamically add mapping for field [field.email]. Existing mapping for [data.field] must be of type object but found [text].
```

This means that the type of a field in one of the data fields was changed. In this case, `data.field` was originally text, but the request causing this error message was trying to put an object into that attribute.

Elasticsearch will dynamically build a schema based upon custom data, so it is critical that the schema not be modified.

The fix is:

* understand how the field types changed
* find the user's Id
* modify the problematic `data` fields via the User API to remove the mismatched fields

Unfortunately, you can't search for the user by email or username or other characteristics using the User Search API. If you have the user's Id, which may be available in the error messages, you can use that. Searching by UUID doesn't use Elasticsearch. If you do not have the UUID, you should change to the database search engine to find the user. You can switch back to Elasticsearch after you have corrected the `data` field.

If you have a support contract, please https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/[open a ticket] and we'll help you out. If not, please back up your FusionAuth database and test the fix thoroughly in a staging environment before applying it to your production instance.
