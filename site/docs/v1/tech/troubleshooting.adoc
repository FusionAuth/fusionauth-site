== Overview

If any problems arise or if you are unable to access FusionAuth, consult the FusionAuth log files. In most cases API errors will be written out to the `fusionauth-app.log` file, but for some installations such as Docker, the errors will be sent to `stdout`.

If you need further assistance, please ask a question in the https://fusionauth.io/community/forum/[FusionAuth forum, window="_blank"] or open an issue on https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/new/choose[Github, window="_blank"] if you have found a bug (please provide replication steps). 

If you have a paid edition which includes support you may open a support request from your https://account.fusionauth.io/[FusionAuth Account, window="_blank"] page. Learn more about link:/pricing/[purchasing support].

=== Logs

==== System Log UI

The system logs may be reviewed in the FusionAuth admin UI by navigating to [breadcrumb]#System -> Logs#.  This feature was added in version 1.16.0. This UI will only render logs for systems that write their logs out to disk.  Deployments which write logs to STDOUT, such is the case with Docker, will not be able to review logs through this interface.

The system log UI organizes and renders the most recent 64KB of all logs for all nodes in the deployment.  If you need the entire log, use the download action in the upper-right hand corner of UI to download a zip of all logs.

==== Filesystem Logs

Alternatively, the logs may be accessed directly.  The following are the default locations for each of the FusionAuth log files. You may or may not have all of the FusionAuth services installed for your system, so you may not have all of the following logs on your server.

[source,shell]
.Linux and macOS
----
/usr/local/fusionauth/logs/fusionauth-app.log
/usr/local/fusionauth/logs/fusionauth-search.log
----

These paths assume the suggested product location of `\fusionauth`. This path may be different on your system depending on where you unpacked the zip files.

[source]
.Windows
----
\fusionauth\logs\fusionauth-app.log
\fusionauth\logs\fusionauth-search.log
----

Note that if you started Windows via Fast Path, the `fusionauth-app.log` file will not be created. Instead the services are running interactively and all logging is written to to stdout.

==== Event Log

[NOTE.since]
====
Available since 1.6.0
====

The event log is a FusionAuth message store designed to capture different types of events that may be necessary to communicate to a FusionAuth developer or admin user.

The event log may contain helpful details to indicate the cause of the failure, or a failure condition you need to be aware of in FusionAuth. See [breadcrumb]#System -> Event Log#.

While not limited to, generally speaking the event log will contain events or errors related to external systems or asynchronous issues that are difficult to communicate to the API caller or the FusionAuth admin at runtime. While not intended to be an exhaustive list, examples of these types of errors are:

- SMTP connection issues
- Lambda invocation errors
- External identity provider failures or configuration issues
- Failure to deliver a webhook event

== Troubleshooting Two Factor Authentication

If you are receiving an invalid code for your two factor authentication and you are using a link:/docs/v1/tech/tutorials/two-factor/authenticator-app/[time based one time password (TOTP) application such as Google Authenticator or Authy], confirm that the system time is correct on the server.

The TOTP two factor auth system is time dependent and if there is any slippage between the system time of the client and the system time of the server, the generated code will not be correct. This is also known as "clock skew". 

The fix is to ensure that the FusionAuth server has the correct system time. How exactly do that that depends on the type of system; please consult your operating system documentation.

== Troubleshooting Database Connections

If you find that FusionAuth is unable to connect to the database, ensure you are able to use a command line client connection to successfully make a connection using the same port and credentials.

Some MySQL services such as Microsoft Azure may require a specific version of TLS to connect successfully. At the time of writing this note, the MySQL connector will not attempt to utilize TLSv1.2 by default, so when connecting to a service that requires this version you will need to explicitly request this version of TLS on the connection string. For example, appending this `enabledTLSProtocols=TLSv1.2` to the connection string will allow you to successfully connect to an Azure managed MySQL database. See https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/8.0/en/connector-j-reference-using-ssl.html[MySQL Connector : Connecting Securely Using SSL] for additional information.

== Common Errors

=== Access Denied

If you see an Access Denied error in your browser while using the FusionAuth UI, this could be caused by a mis-configured CDN or proxy. This error often produces a 4xx error code such as a 403. In order to fix this issue, ensure that your CDN, proxy or gateway does not prevent traffic from flowing directly to FusionAuth. FusionAuth is able to handle all HTTP traffic and any network handling between the browser and FusionAuth should be as simple as possible.

=== FusionAuth Stops Unexpectedly

If you are running FusionAuth on a server with limited memory, it may stop unexpectedly. This can also happen when there are many other applications competing for memory on the server. 

When FusionAuth is killed because of an out of memory issue (OOM), it dies with no explanation in the FusionAuth logs. You might see lines like this in server system logs (typically under `/var/log/`):

```
Dec 30 12:00:38 vps kernel: Out of memory: Kill process 30047 (java) score 98 or sacrifice child
```

The OOM killer will begin killing services once the kernel runs out of memory. The solution will be to allocate less memory to FusionAuth or to increase the amount of RAM available. 

You can do the former with the `fusionauth-app.memory` setting. See the link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/configuration/[configuration reference] for more details. 

You may do the latter by running a larger server or running fewer competing applications. In particular, applications used by FusionAuth such as Elasticsearch or the database may be moved off to external servers.
