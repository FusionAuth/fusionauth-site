Once you have completed this configuration you will be able to enable the Sign in with Apple login button for one or more FusionAuth Applications. Below is an example login page with the Apple Identity Provider enabled.

== Create an Apple Developer Account

Ensure you have an Apple Developer account, and then navigate to your Apple Developer account.

* https://developer.apple.com/

If you do not yet have an Apple Developer account, please do this now. Once you have logged into Apple and have obtained access to your Apple Developer account, continue to the next step.

== Configure your Apple Developer Account

If you already have an App ID, Service ID and key configured for Sign in with Apple, you may utilize these existing values. If you have yet to configure your Apple developer account for Sign in with Apple, complete the following steps.

=== Register a New App ID

image::identity-providers/identity-provider-apple-identifiers.png[Apple Identifiers,width=1200,role=shadowed bottom-cropped]

From your Apple Developer account, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles# and select [breadcrumb]#Identifiers# from the left column. Click on the plus icon to add a new identifier.

image::identity-providers/identity-provider-apple-add-app-ids.png[Register a new Identifier,width=1200,role=shadowed bottom-cropped]

Select [breadcrumb]#App IDs# and click Continue. On the next panel, fill in the Description field and [breadcrumb]#Sign in with Apple# from the list of capabilities and then click Continue. On the next panel confirm your selection, make a note of the App ID Prefix (Team ID) and click Register.

=== Register a New Service ID

image::identity-providers/identity-provider-apple-identifiers.png[Apple Identifiers,width=1200,role=shadowed bottom-cropped]

From your Apple Developer account, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles# and select [breadcrumb]#Identifiers# from the left column. Click on plus icon to add a new identifier.

image::identity-providers/identity-provider-apple-add-service-ids.png[Register a new Identifier,width=1200,role=shadowed bottom-cropped]

Select [breadcrumb]#Service IDs# and click Continue. On the next panel, fill in the Description the Identifier fields and click Continue. Complete this step by clicking Register on the following panel.

Edit your newly created Service Id, enable and then configure [breadcrumb]#Sign In with Apple#. Clicking the Configure button will open a Web Authentication Configuration panel. In this step you will need to configure your application domain and return URL of your FusionAuth service.

If you do not see the [breadcrumb]#Domains and Subdomains# and the [breadcrumb]#Return URLs# text input fields, click the plus icon next to Website URLs.

Next, enter your application domain and Return URL.

For example, if the FusionAuth URL is `\https://login.piedpiper.com` then the origin would be `login.piedpiper.com`. The Return URL is the FusionAuth URL with a path of `/oauth2/callback`, so in this example the return URL would be `\https://login.piedpiper.com/oauth2/callback`.

Additional domains and return URLs may be added at a later time as well. Once you have completed this configuration, save your changes and click Continue. Confirm your changes to the Services ID by clicking Save.

=== Register a New Key

image::identity-providers/identity-provider-apple-keys.png[Apple Identifiers,width=1200,role=shadowed bottom-cropped]

From your Apple Developer account, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles# and select [breadcrumb]#Keys# from the left column. Click on the plus icon to add a new key.

image::identity-providers/identity-provider-apple-new-key.png[Register a new Key,width=1200,role=shadowed bottom-cropped]

Enter a name for your key.

image::identity-providers/identity-provider-apple-new-key-signin.png[Register a new Key,width=1200,role=shadowed bottom-cropped]

Enable the [breadcrumb]#Sign in with Apple# checkbox, and then click the Configure button.

On the next panel select the previously created App ID and click Save. Click Continue, and then confirm key registration by clicking Register. When prompted to download the key, do so and make a note of the [breadcrumb]#Key ID#.

== Import the Private Key

Now that we have completed the Apple configuration, we can import the private key we collected in the previous step. To import the private key, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Key Master# and select [breadcrumb]#Import Private Key# from the actions in the top right.

[NOTE]
====
Make sure you use the `Key ID` from the previous step for the [field]#Key identifier# field.
====

Enter the `Key ID` from the previous step and enter it into the [field]#Key identifier# field. Using a text editor, open the key file you downloaded in the previous step and copy the value into the [field]#Private key# field.

== Create an Apple Identity Provider

The last step will be to create an Apple Identity Provider in FusionAuth. To create an Identity Provider navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Identity Providers# and click [breadcrumb]#Add provider# and select `Apple` from the dialog.

This will take you to the [breadcrumb]#Add Apple# panel, and you'll fill out the required fields using the values from your Apple Developer account. The button text is also required but it will be defaulted to `Sign in with Apple`, you may optionally modify this default value.

:identity_provider!:

== Apple Private Mail Relay Configuration

When a user logs in with Apple, they will be provided an option to send their actual email address or an anonymous email address back to FusionAuth.

For example, if the user selects to use an anonymous email address, FusionAuth will receive an email that ends in `@privaterelay.appleid.com`. This email address may be used to communicate with the user, however it means that the email will be routed through Apple's Private Email Relay service. To ensure your email is delivered you will want to register your email domain and perform any necessary configuration with your SMTP service provider.

Some Email Service providers may provide documentation to assist you in making the necessary configuration changes. For example, the following article is provided by SendGrid to help you send email through Apple's Private Email Relay.

== CORS Configuration

In order to complete the login request, Apple will make an HTTP `POST` request to the callback URL in FusionAuth. In order for this request to be allowed through the CORS filter you will need to navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> System -> CORS# and add `\https://appleid.apple.com` as an [field]#Allowed Origin# the CORS configuration.

Once you complete your Apple Identity Provider configuration, if your CORS configuration is not yet configured to allow the Apple login request to complete you wil be shown the following warning prompting you to complete the CORS configuration. See the link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/cors/[CORS Filter reference] for additional details on modifying the CORS configuration.

=== Troubleshooting CORS

If you receive a `403` status code in the browser console during login when using Safari, additional configuration is required. The redirect flow is slightly different between the browsers.

To resolve this issue, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> System -> CORS# and add the `GET` method to the [field]#Allowed methods#.

== Building Your Own Integration

:identity_provider_path: apple
include::docs/v1/tech/identity-providers/_login-api-integration.adoc[]
:identity_provider_path!:


== Troubleshooting

If you see the following error in the UI:

```
A request to the Apple Token API has failed. Unable to complete this login request.
```

And this error is logged in the Event Log:

```
Status code [400] Error response is { "error" : "invalid_client" }
```

Ensure that you have imported the private key provided by Apple into FusionAuth using the [field]#Key ID# specified in the Apple Developer Account dashboard.

If you import with the default behavior, FusionAuth will generate an identifier. The generated key identifier will not match the value expected by Apple and the integration will fail with the above error.

If you encounter this error, re-import the private key with the correct Id to ensure the key identifier is set correctly.
