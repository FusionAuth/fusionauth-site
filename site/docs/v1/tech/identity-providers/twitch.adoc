Once you have completed this configuration you will be able to enable the Twitch login button for one or more FusionAuth Applications. Below is an example login page with the Twitch Identity Provider enabled.

Ensure you have a Twitch account, and then navigate to the Twitch Developer dashboard. Please note that you will need to have verified your account and enabled two-factor authentication.

== Create a Twitch Account

If you do not yet have a Twitch app you will need to create an app in this step. If you already have a Twitch app that you plan to use for FusionAuth, please review this section anyway to ensure your configuration is correct to support the Twitch Identity Provider.

In the following screenshot you will find an example of creating an application in Twitch. Review the following sections to ensure your configuration is correct. Fill out any required fields found on this form and click the `Create` button to create a new Twitter app.


=== Add the Callback URL

In this example I have registered `\https://login.piedpiper.com/oauth-callback` as the callback URL. Please note that Twitch requires this URL to use the `HTTPS` schema.

=== Choose a Category

You can select the category of the application for which you are enabling the ability to login with Twitch.

=== Keys and token

Once you click `Create`, you will be redirected back to the dashboard for applications. From there, you will have to click `Manage` to view the client id and the client secret. Create a secret by clicking on the "New Secret" button. These two values will be used to configure the FusionAuth Identity Provider.

There is no further configuration to perform on this panel, you will only need to record or copy these values for the next step.

Once you have completed this configuration you will be able to enable the Twitch login button for one or more FusionAuth Applications.
