== Configure OpenID Connect with Discord

Once you have completed this configuration you may enable an OpenID Connect "Login with Discord" button for one or more FusionAuth Applications. See link:https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2/[Discord - OAuth2] for an additional reference.

=== Register a Discord OAuth2 Application

You will first need to log in to link:https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/[Discord].

Once logged in, navigate to link:https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/[https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/] and create a new application.

Once the application has been created, note the `CLIENT ID` and the `CLIENT SECRET`.  These will be used respectively as the [field]#Client Id# value and the [field]#Client secret# value in your FusionAuth OpenID Connect Identity Provider configuration.

Now navigate to [breadcrumb]#Selected App -> Settings -> OAuth2# in the navigation pane on the left side of the screen to configure OAuth2 for your Discord app.

Here we have configured a `REDIRECT` for our application.  If FusionAuth is running at `https://login.piedpiper.com`, this value should be `https://login.piedpiper.com/oauth2/callback`.

=== Configure a New FusionAuth OpenID Connect Identity Provider

To create a Discord Identity Provider return to FusionAuth and  navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Identity Providers# and click `Add OpenID Connect`.

This will take you to the `Add OpenID Connect` screen, and you'll fill out the required fields. [field]#Client Id# and [field]#Client secret# values reference the previously noted Discord Application's `CLIENT ID` and `CLIENT SECRET`. The [field]#Redirect URL# is read only and generated for you based upon the URL of FusionAuth. This value should match the one you configured in your Discord application.

Discord has not implemented a well-known configuration endpoint, so you will need to disable the [field]#Discover endpoints# field and specify the endpoints manually.  The values for these fields are:

* `Authorization endpoint` - `https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize`
* `Token endpoint` - `https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/token`
* `Userinfo endpoint` - `https://discordapp.com/api/users/@me`

You will need to specify the scopes `identify` and `email` in the [field]#Scope# field for your application.

You will need to set [field]#Client authentication method# to `Request body (client_secret_post)`, as Discord expects the `client_secret` in the request body of the authentication request.

Additionally, you will need to update the [field]#Unique Id Claim# field to `id` (from the standard claim of `sub`) under the [breadcrumb]#Options# tab.

In the following screenshot you will see that we have enabled this login provider for the `Pied Piper` application and enabled [field]#Create registration#.

Discord does not implement OpenID Connect to spec. In order to pull in some additional data for populating the user profile (Discord username, Avatar URL, etc.) you can enable a [field]#Reconcile lambda#.  Review link:/docs/v1/tech/lambdas/openid-connect-response-reconcile[the lambda documentation] to learn about how to create and assign your own lambda.  This is optional.

That's it, now the `Login with Discord` button will show up on the login page of our `PiedPiper` application.
