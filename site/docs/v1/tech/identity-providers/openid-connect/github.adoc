== Configure OpenID Connect with GitHub

[NOTE]
====
GitHub user's must have a public email address configured to link on email (See link:/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers#linking-strategies[Linking Strategies]).  A more cautious approach would be to link on username or create an anonymous link to ensure that this Github OIDC connection is always functional.
====

Once you have completed this configuration you may enable an OpenID Connect "Login with GitHub" button for one or more FusionAuth Applications. See link:https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/[GitHub - Creating an OAuth App] for an additional reference.

=== Register a GitHub OAuth2 Application

You will first need to login to link:https://github.com/[GitHub].

Once logged in, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Developer settings -> OAuth Apps -> Register a new application# to create a new GitHub OAuth Application.

Here we have configured our application `Authorization callback URL`.  If FusionAuth is running at `[host]`, this value should be `https://[host]/oauth2/callback`.

Once the application has been created, note the `Client ID` and the `Client Secret`.  These will be used respectively as the [field]#Client Id# value and the [field]#Client secret# value in your FusionAuth OpenID Connect Identity Providers configuration.  Please note that you may have to click on "Generate a new client secret"

=== Configure a New FusionAuth OpenID Connect Identity Provider

To create a GitHub Identity Provider return to FusionAuth and navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Identity Providers# and click `Add provider` and select `OpenID Connect` from the dialog.

This will take you to the `Add OpenID Connect` panel, and you'll fill out the required fields.

You will need to set [field]#Client authentication method# to `HTTP Basic authentication (client_secret_basic)`.

[field]#Client Id# and [field]#Client secret# values reference the previously noted GitHub OAuth Application's `Client ID` and `Client Secret`. The [field]#Redirect URL# is read only and generated for you based upon the URL of FusionAuth, this value should match the one you configured in your GitHub application.

GitHub has not implemented a well-known configuration endpoint, so you will need to disable the [field]#Discover endpoints# field and specify the endpoints manually.  The values for these fields are:

* `Authorization endpoint` - `\https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize`
* `Token endpoint` - `\https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token`
* `Userinfo endpoint` - `\https://api.github.com/user`

You will need to specify `user:email` as a [field]#Scope# for your application.

In the following screenshot you will see that we have enabled this login provider for the `Pied Piper` application and enabled [field]#Create registration#.

GitHub does not implement OpenID Connect to spec. In order to pull in some additional data for populating the user profile (GitHub shortname, Image URL, etc.) you can enable a [field]#Reconcile lambda#.  See link:/docs/v1/tech/lambdas/openid-connect-response-reconcile/[this example lambda] which is based on the GitHub use case.  This is optional.

The final item to configure is under the options tab.  For Github, you will want to indicate:

- [field]#Unique Id claim# of `id`
- [field]#Email claim# of `email`
- [field]#Username claim# of `login`

That's it, now the `Login with GitHub` button will show up on the login page of our `Pied Piper` application.
