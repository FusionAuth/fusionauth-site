[field]#Callback URL (ACS)#::
An Assertion Consumer Service (or ACS) is the location at a service provider that accepts messages to establish a session based on the assertion.
+
By default the redirect URI will be the first Authorized redirect URI found in the FusionAuth Application OAuth configuration. To specify a redirect URI send the authorized URI in the `RelayState` parameter. Support for using the `RelayState` in this manner is supported in FusionAuth version greater than or equal to `1.41.0`. In prior versions, append a query parameter named `redirect_uri` to the ACS in the IdP configuration.
+
Note: For IdP initiated logins in order to receive a refresh token the query parameter `?scope=offline_access` will need to be appended to the url. When logging into the FusionAuth Admin application this parameter is included by default and does not need to be supplied.

[field]#Issuer#::
The service provider EntityId. This is a URL.

[field]#Metadata URL#::
The URL where the service provider metadata resides.
