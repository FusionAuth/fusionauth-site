== Overview

Adding a Login with Twitter button to FusionAuth is simple, and this guide will walk you through the steps necessary to collect the credentials from Twitter in order to enable this Social login.

* <<Create a Twitter App>>
* <<Create a Twitter Identity Provider>>
* <<Building Your Own Integration>>

Once you have completed this configuration you will be able to enable the Twitter login button for one or more FusionAuth Applications. Below is an example login page with the Twitter Identity Provider enabled.

== Create a Twitter Account

Ensure you have a Twitter account, and then navigate to the Twitter Developer dashboard.

* https://developer.twitter.com

If you do not yet have a developer account, you will need to apply for access to the Twitter API.

* https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access.html

Once you have logged into Twitter and have obtained access to a Twitter developer account, continue to the next step.

== Create a Twitter App

If you do not yet have a Twitter app you will need to create an app in this step. If you already have a Twitter app that you plan to use for FusionAuth please review this section anyway to ensure your configuration is correct to support the Twitter login.

* https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps

In the following screenshot you will find an example of the Create an App process. Review the following sections to ensure your configuration is correct.

=== Record the Keys and Token

The API key and API secret key are typically presented at the onset of app creation. Record these values. They will be needed for later integration with the FusionAuth IdP.

=== Authentication Settings

You will need to modify a few setting here to enable Twitter to connect with FusionAuth.

==== Add the Callback URL +++<span style"height: 50%; width: 50%;"><span class="fa-stack fa-2x" style="color: #F4821F;"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-1x"></i><span class="fa-stack-1x calendar-text" style="color: black; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: medium">1</span></span>+++ & +++<span class="fa-stack fa-2x" style="color: #F4821F;"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-1x"></i><span class="fa-stack-1x calendar-text" style="color: black; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: medium">2</span></span>+++

In this example I have registered `\https://login.piedpiper.com/oauth2/callback` as the callback URL. Enable 3-legged OAuth and complete all required fields.

The first part of that value will be equal to the public URL of FusionAuth, in this case `\https://login.piedpiper.com`. The second part, the actual redirect URI will always be `/oauth2/callback`.

==== Request Email +++<span class="fa-stack fa-2x" style="color: #F4821F;"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-1x"></i><span class="fa-stack-1x calendar-text" style="color: black; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: medium">3</span></span>+++

Finally, you will want to ensure you have checked `Request email address from users.`  Please note, for some Twitter users, it is possible to create an account without an email address. If this is the case for your Twitter users, you will want to configure the IdP below to link on a username, or create a pending link. See link:/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers#linking-strategies[Linking Strategies]

=== Keys and token

Now click on the [breadcrumb]#Keys and tokens# tab. In this section you will find the Consumer API keys. These two values will be used to configure the FusionAuth Identity Provider.

There is no further configuration to perform on this panel, you will only need to record or copy these values for the next step. These values are typically displayed at the onset of app creation and then hidden. Click regenerate to obtain a new value and remember to update your codebase with these new values.

== Create a Twitter Identity Provider

The last step will be to create a Twitter Identity Provider in FusionAuth. To create an Identity Provider navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Identity Providers# and click `Add provider` and select `Twitter` from the dialog.

This will take you to the `Add Twitter` panel, and you'll fill out the `Consumer key` and `Consumer secret` required fields using the values found in the Twitter App `Keys and tokens` tab from the previous step. The button text is also required but it will be defaulted to `Login with Twitter`, you may optionally modify this default value.

To configure a lambda, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Lambdas#.

[field]#Debug enabled# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `false`#::
Enable debug to create an event log to assist you in debugging integration errors.

== Proxy details

If you are running FusionAuth behind a proxy of some sort, please review the following information.

FusionAuth will detect the public URL of your instance at runtime to send to Twitter as the callback URL. If you are behind a proxy, ensure that the `X-Forwarded-Host` and the `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers are added by your proxy if the host or protocol do not match what is behind the proxy. For example, if your public URL is using `https` and your proxy is performing SSL acceleration the URL behind the proxy may be `http`. In this scenario, most proxies will have added the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header to the request which will allow FusionAuth to send the correct URL to Twitter.
