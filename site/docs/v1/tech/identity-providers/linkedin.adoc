Adding a Sign in with LinkedIn button to FusionAuth is simple, and this guide will walk you through the steps necessary to collect the credentials from LinkedIn in order to enable this Social login.

Once you have completed this configuration you will be able to enable the LinkedIn login button for one or more FusionAuth Applications. Below is an example login page with the LinkedIn Identity Provider enabled.

First, log in to LinkedIn and navigate to the https://www.linkedin.com/developers/[developer portal].

== Optionally Create a LinkedIn App

If you have an existing LinkedIn app which you are going to use, skip this step.

If you don't have an existing LinkedIn app, navigate to the https://www.linkedin.com/developer/apps/new[new application form] and fill it out. In the following example I will create my first application before I can create credentials. I will call the application `Pied Piper`.

== Grant Your App Required Permissions

In the LinkedIn developer portal, ensure you are viewing the correct LinkedIn application by navigating to [breadcrumb]#My apps -> Your Application#.

If you don't see the [breadcrumb]#Products# tab for your application, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Products# in the top level menu. This may occur if this is your first LinkedIn application.

Navigate to [breadcrumb]#My apps -> Your Application -> Products#. Select `Sign In With LinkedIn` and accept the terms.

[NOTE]
====
Your application may not be immediately available. It may be reviewed for a time by the LinkedIn platform team.

== Set Up Your LinkedIn App Client Credentials

In the LinkedIn developer portal, ensure you are viewing the correct LinkedIn app by navigating to [breadcrumb]#My apps -> Your Application#.

View the application credentials by going to [breadcrumb]#Auth -> Application credentials#. Record both the `Client ID` and the `Client Secret` values.

Add your redirect URL. This value will be your FusionAuth installation hostname with the string `/oauth2/callback` appended. For example, if you are going to access FusionAuth at `https://login.piedpiper.com` then you will add `https://login.piedpiper.com/oauth2/callback` to the `Authorized redirect URLs for your app` list.

Save the setting.

You should see the following scopes in the [breadcrumb]#Oauth 2.0 Scopes# section:

* `r_emailaddress`
* `r_liteprofile`

[NOTE]
====
If you do not see these scopes, you may not have added the LinkedIn product to your LinkedIn app correctly. You may also need to reload the app page or log out of LinkedIn and log in again to make sure your application has the proper permissions.
====

Now you have completed creating a LinkedIn App with the appropriate permissions.

== Create a LinkedIn Identity Provider

The last step will be to create a LinkedIn Identity Provider in FusionAuth. Log in to the FusionAuth administrative user interface. Create an Identity Provider by navigating to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Identity Providers# and click on the menu on the upper right and select `Add LinkedIn`.

This will take you to the `Add LinkedIn` screen, and you'll fill out the `Client Id` and `Client secret` required fields with the values previously recorded. The button text is also required, but it will be defaulted to `Sign in with LinkedIn`. You may optionally modify this value.
