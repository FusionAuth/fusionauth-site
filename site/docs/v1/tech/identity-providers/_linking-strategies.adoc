The linking strategy to use when creating the link between the Identity Provider and the user.

The possible values are:

* `Create a Pending Link` - Do not automatically link, instead return a pending link identifier that can be used to link to an existing user.
* `Anonymously Link` - Always create a link based upon the unique Id returned by the identity provider. A username or email is not required and will not be used to link the user. A reconcile lambda will not be used in this configuration.
* `Link On Email` - Link to an existing user based upon email. A user will be created with the email returned by the identity provider if one does not already exist.
* `Link On Email. Do not create the user if they do not exist` - Only link to an existing user based upon email. A user will not be created if one does not already exist with email returned by the identity provider.
* `Link On Username` - Link to an existing user based upon username. A user will be created with the username returned by the identity provider if one does not already exist.
* `Link On Username. Do not create the user if they do not exist` - Only link to an existing user based upon username. A user will not be created if one does not already exist with the username returned by the identity provider.
