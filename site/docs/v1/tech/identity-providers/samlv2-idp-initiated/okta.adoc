== Configure SAML v2 IdP Initiated SSO With Okta

This page will guide you in configuring a SAMLv2 IdP Initiated Identity Provider with Okta as the initiating IdP. You will be able to visit an Okta provided link, authenticate and then be logged in to FusionAuth.

This document assumes you have an admin account with Okta and a valid FusionAuth paid edition license.

== Create and Partially Configure the Okta SSO Application

Navigate to the Okta admin screen, and add an application. Search for `SAML Service Provider` and add this type of application.

Add an [field]#Application label# describing the application. Configure any other "General Settings" as needed.

Click "Next". You will arrive at the "Sign-On Options" section.

Click "View Setup Instructions". This will open needed instructions in a separate browser tab:

image::identity-providers/idp-initiated/okta-saml-sp-configuration-instructions.png[Configuration instructions for the SAML SP when creating a SAMLv2 application in Okta,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Record the [field]#Identity Provider Issuer# and [field]#Identity Provider HTTP Post URL# values. The former is a string such as `exkq14ymac31Bx7895d6`. There may be a typo in the instructions with the string `is` prefixed to the [field]#Identity Provider Issuer#.

Download the "Identity Provider Certificate" too, then close the instructions tab.

== Add the Okta Public Certificate to FusionAuth

Log in to the FusionAuth administrative user interface and navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Key Master#.

Import the Okta provided certificate you just downloaded.

== Add the SAMLv2 IdP Initiated Identity Provider

Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Identity Providers#. Add a SAMLv2 IdP Initiated Provider.

* Configure the [field]#Name# with a descriptive value.
* Set the [field]#Issuer# value to the [field]#Identity Provider Issuer# value from Okta.
* Set the [field]#Verification key# to the public certificate you just imported.

Enable this Identity Provider for any FusionAuth applications. For this example, `Pied Piper` allows use of this Identity Provider.

Any users who authenticate with Okta will be registered for this application because of the [field]#Create registrations# setting.

All other options may be left with default values. Save the configuration.

== View the Identity Provider in FusionAuth

View the created Identity Provider and navigate to the [field]#SAML v2 Integration details# section.

Record the values of the [field]#Callback URL (ACS)# and [field]#Issuer# fields. Those will be used later.

== CORS Settings

Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> System -> CORS#.

Determine the hostname and scheme of the Okta Identity Provider HTTP POST URL. If the URL is `https://example.okta.com/app/generic-saml/11111151wmJ3HKZYD5d6/saml2`, then the hostname and scheme are `https://example.okta.com`.

Add this value to the CORS [field]#Allowed origins# field. Ensure that the `POST` method is checked in the [field]#Allowed methods# field. Save the configuration

== Configure the FusionAuth Application Redirect URL

Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Applications -> Your Application -> OAuth#. Update the [field]#Authorized redirect URLs# field to include `https://local.fusionauth.io/?client_id=CLIENTID` where CLIENTID is the value from the [field]#Client id# field.

[NOTE]
====
This URL is where a user will end up after authentication and may be any value URL.
====

Ensure the Authorization Code grant is enabled.

== Complete SSO Configuration in Okta

Return to the [breadcrumb]#Sign-on Options# tab in the Okta Admin screen.

* Set the value of the [field]#Assertion Consumer Service URL# to the value of the [field]#Callback URL (ACS)# from the FusionAuth Identity Provider recorded above.
* Set the value of the [field]#Service Provider Entity Id# to the value of the [field]#Issuer# recorded above.
* Set the [field]#Application username format# to be `Email`.

image::identity-providers/idp-initiated/okta-sign-on-advanced-settings.png[Configure Okta with the FusionAuth SP information,width=1200]

Save the Okta application by clicking "Done".

Scroll to the [breadcrumb]#App Embed Link# section and note the [field]#Embed Link# value. This is the link a user needs to visit to begin the IdP initiated SSO, so you could place it in your application's navigation, launchpad or elsewhere.

Finally, click on the [breadcrumb]#Assignments# tab and assign the user to the application.

== Test It Out

Open an incognito browser window and visit the [field]#Embed Link# value. Log in with your Okta IdP credentials.

image::identity-providers/idp-initiated/okta-login-page.png[Logging in with Okta,width=1200]

When you authenticate successfully, you will eventually land at the URL configured in the application's [field]#Authorized redirect URLs# field. The full URL contains an authorization code.

Since you configured registration for this Identity Provider, if the user did not previously exist in your FusionAuth instance, they will now have an account.

For a production application, the authorization code would be exchanged by your application for a JWT from FusionAuth.
