`<base_url>` is the URL for your FusionAuth instance, something like `\https://login.piedpiper.com`. 

`<identityProviderId>` is the Id of the Identity Provider, and will be a valid UUID.

`<applicationId>` is the id of the application that is the target of the login, and will be a valid UUID.

For an SP-initiated configuration:

*Callback URL (ACS):*
`<base_url>/samlv2/acs`

For an IdP-initiated configuration (per application):

*Callback URL (ACS):*
`<base_url>/samlv2/acs/<identityProviderId>/<applicationId>`

*Issuer:*
`<base_url>/samlv2/sp/<identityProviderId>`

*Metadata URL:*
`<base_url>/samlv2/sp/metadata/<identityProviderId>`

Note: When supplying the `Callback URL (ACS)` for IdP initiated logins in order to receive a refresh token the query parameter `?scope=offline_access` will need to be appended to the url. When logging into the FusionAuth Admin application this parameter is included by default and does not need to be supplied.
