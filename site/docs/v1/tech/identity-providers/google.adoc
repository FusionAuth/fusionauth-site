== Overview

Adding a Login with Google button to FusionAuth is simple, and this guide will walk you through the steps necessary to collect the credentials from Google in order to enable this Social login.

* <<Create a Google Cloud Account>>
* <<Create Google OAuth client credentials>>
* <<Create a Google Identity Provider>>
* <<Building Your Own Integration>>

Once you have completed this configuration you will be able to enable the Google login button for one or more FusionAuth Applications. Below is an example login page with the Google Identity Provider enabled.

== Create a Google Cloud Account

Ensure you have a Google login, and then navigate to the Google Cloud console.

* https://console.cloud.google.com

== Create Google OAuth client credentials

In the Google Cloud console, find the APIs & Services Credentials by navigating to [breadcrumb]#APIs and Services -> Credentials#.

If you are prompted to select or create a project, do that now. In the following example I will need to create my first project before I can create credentials. I will call the project `Pied Piper`.

Now that you have selected or created your first project, click on `Create credentials` and select `OAuth client ID`.

If you see an alert indicating you first need to configure the content screen, do that now by clicking on `Configure consent screen`.

On this panel, you will need to fill out the required fields and then click `Save`. Once this is complete you may return the `Credentials` tab to complete creating the OAuth credentials.

In this example I have set the following fields.

* Application name
* Authorized domains
* Application Homepage link
* Application Privacy Policy link
* Application Terms of Service link

Now you may return to the Credential section, click on `Create credentials` and select `OAuth client ID`.

On this panel, select `Web application`, specify the name of the credential and fill out the `Authorized JavaScript origins` field. This value should be the origin of your application login page. In this example I have specified `\https://login.piedpiper.com` because this is the URL of FusionAuth for Pied Piper.

Now you have completed creating a Google OAuth client credential. If you select the newly created credential, you will be provided with the `Client ID` and `Client secret` necessary for the next step.

== Create a Google Identity Provider

The last step will be to create a Google Identity Provider in FusionAuth. To create an Identity Provider navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Identity Providers# and click `Add provider` and select `Google` from the dialog.

This will take you to the `Add Google` panel, and you'll fill out the `Client Id` and `Client secret` required fields using the values found in the Google Cloud console. The button text is also required but it will be defaulted to `Login with Google`, you may optionally modify this default value.
