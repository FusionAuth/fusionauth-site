=== A Note About User Images in this Documentation

== Finding the Self Service Page

To view the account and self service pages, login as an admin and navigate to [breadcrumb]#Applications# and click on the icon:search[role=ui-button green,type=fas] icon to view the application details. 

From here copy and paste the account URL into a browser. Use a different browser than the one you are using to access the FusionAuth administrative user interface, or use your browser in incognito mode.

In a real world application this link would be part of the navigation for your application.

=== Account Home

Before accessing the account you will be asked to log in. Make sure the user you log in with is registered for this application.

=== Update User Data and Password

FusionAuth Self Service Account Management allows users to easily update their user data and passwords.  To adjust user profile data, click on the edit icon in the upper corner.  From there a user will be presented with editable fields for user data and their password. 

More information about updating user data and passwords can be found in the link:/docs/v1/tech/account-management/updating-user-data[Updating User Data and Password] section.

Current supported MFA types are:

- SMS
- Email

If you are not seeing this screen, you may need additional configuration.
Please see link:/docs/v1/tech/account-management/troubleshooting/[troubleshooting] steps.

You can click on the links below for more about setting up each MFA method.

=== Recovery Codes

Please note that once an authenticator is enabled, users will be displayed recovery codes similar to what is shown below. 

Please encourage your users to save these in a secure location, as they can be used to recover an account, should one of their second factors fail to be available. For example, if an email or sms service is "down" and users still want to use your application, or if a user loses their phone, a recovery code allows access.
