=== Not Registered

Please note, if the user is not registered to the application, they will not be able to self serve from the Account Management page.

To remedy --

From the Admin UI click on `icon:users[type="fas"] Users > icon:address-card[type="fas"] Manage >  Registrations Tab > icon:plus[type="fas"] Add registration > Add User` Another option is to programmatically add the user to teh application through the API.
