== Self Service For Users

FusionAuth Self Service Registration Forms allows users to update most of their own data from a hosted page.  Below we will document two common tasks users - updating passwords and other user data fields.

* <<User Profile Data (User Facing)>>
* <<Update User Password (User Facing)>>

=== User Profile Data (User Facing)

To edit your profile data, navigate to account self service home and click on the edit icon in the top right.

Once on the account self service edit screen your information (user object) can be updated directly.

Any changes here will be saved to your user in FusionAuth.

To edit profile data (including the password) on the user, navigate to account self service home and click on the edit icon in the top right.
