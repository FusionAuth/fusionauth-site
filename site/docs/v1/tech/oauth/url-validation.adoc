== Overview

Beginning in version `1.43.0` FusionAuth provides support for wildcards in OAuth 2.0 redirect URLs and origin URLs. This document provides details on where wildcards are allowed in configured values and the valid replacement patterns for wildcards in each position.

== URL Validation Policy

In order to validate allowed authorized redirect and origin URLs containing wildcards, the [field]#URL validation# setting must be configured to `Allow wildcards` under [breadcrumb]#Applications -> Edit Application -> OAuth#.

See the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/applications[Application API] or link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/applications#oauth[Application OAuth Configuration] for details.

== Allowed Wildcard Positions

In order to maintain security while allowing the flexibility of wildcards, FusionAuth limits the position and number of wildcards that are allowed in the configured authorized redirect and origin URLs. The asterisk character, `*`, is the wildcard character.

=== Domain

The domain of a configured URL allows 0 or 1 wildcards in the domain portion of the URL. Wildcards are not allowed if the host is specified by an IP address. If the domain contains a wildcard, it must meet all of the following requirements:

 * The domain must contain at least three segments.
 * The wildcard may only appear in the host portion of the domain (left-most subdomain).
 * The wildcard can be a full or partial replacement of the host.

The following table provides some examples of valid and invalid wildcard patterns.

[cols="45m,10,45"]
.Domain Wildcards
|===
| Example | Valid | Reason

|\https://*.example.com
|+++<i class="fas fa-check green-text"></i>+++
|&nbsp;

|\https://blah*.example.com
|+++<i class="fas fa-check green-text"></i>+++
|&nbsp;

|\https://*.com
|+++<i class="fas fa-times red-text"></i>+++
|The domain only contains two segments

|\https://auth.*.com
|+++<i class="fas fa-times red-text"></i>+++
|The wildcard does not appear in the host

|\https://pass:[*]midpass:[*].example.com
|+++<i class="fas fa-times red-text"></i>+++
|The domain contains multiple wildcards

|\https://*.168.1.1
|+++<i class="fas fa-times red-text"></i>+++
|Wildcards are not allowed with IP addresses

|===

=== Port

The port number can be specified as a wildcard. There is no partial wildcard support for the port number.

[cols="45m,10,45"]
.Port Wildcards
|===
| Example | Valid | Reason

|\https://example.com:*
|+++<i class="fas fa-check green-text"></i>+++
|&nbsp;

|\https://example.com:4*
|+++<i class="fas fa-times red-text"></i>+++
|Partial wildcards are not allowed for the port number

|===

=== Path Segments

Wildcards are allowed in path segments with the following restrictions:

 * There can be no more than one wildcard _per path segment_.
 * The wildcard can be a full or partial replacement of the path segment.

The following table provides some examples of valid and invalid wildcard patterns in the path.

[cols="45m,10,45"]
.Path Wildcards
|===
| Example | Valid | Reason

|\https://example.com/path/*/resource
|+++<i class="fas fa-check green-text"></i>+++
|&nbsp;

|\https://example.com/p*/to/resource
|+++<i class="fas fa-check green-text"></i>+++
|&nbsp;

|\https://example.com/pass:[*]/par*tial/pass:[*]
|+++<i class="fas fa-check green-text"></i>+++
|&nbsp;

|\https://example.com/path/pass:[*]midpass:[*]/resource
|+++<i class="fas fa-times red-text"></i>+++
|The path segment contains multiple wildcards

|===

=== Query String Values

Wildcards are allowed in query string values with the following restrictions:

 * Partial wildcards are not allowed for query string values.

Wildcards are _not_ allowed in query string names. The following table provides some examples of valid and invalid wildcard patterns in the query string.

[cols="45m,10,45"]
.Query String Wildcards
|===
| Example | Valid | Reason

|\https://example.com?foo=*
|+++<i class="fas fa-check green-text"></i>+++
|&nbsp;

|\https://example.com?foo=pass:[*]&bar=pass:[*]&baz=blah
|+++<i class="fas fa-check green-text"></i>+++
|&nbsp;

|\https://example.com?foo=par*tial
|+++<i class="fas fa-times red-text"></i>+++
|Partial wildcard replacement is not allowed for query string values

|\https://example.com?*=blah
|+++<i class="fas fa-times red-text"></i>+++
|Wildcards are not allowed in query string names

|===

== Wildcard Replacement Patterns

The position where wildcards are allowed in configured values is just one half of the puzzle. Wildcards in each portion of the URL have different rules for the replacement values. Please note that allowed replacement values may not produce a valid URL. This section provides details on the allowed replacements for wildcards in each portion of the URL. Each wildcard in the configured value must match one or more characters. Matches against empty strings will fail.

=== Domain

Replacements for wildcards in the domain portion of the URL must not contain `.`, `:`, `/`, or `?` characters. The following table lists examples of valid and invalid replacements for valid wildcard patterns.

[cols="25m,25m,10,40"]
.Domain wildcard replacement
|===
| Pattern | Value | Valid | Reason

|\https://*.example.com
|\https://login.example.com
|+++<i class="fas fa-check green-text"></i>+++
|&nbsp;

|\https://auth*.example.com
|\https://auth2.example.com
|+++<i class="fas fa-check green-text"></i>+++
|&nbsp;

|\https://auth*.example.com
|\https://auth.example.com
|+++<i class="fas fa-times red-text"></i>+++
|The value does not contain a character to replace the `*`

|\https://*.example.com
|\https://auth.customer.example.com
|+++<i class="fas fa-times red-text"></i>+++
|The replacement contains a `.` character

|===

=== Port

Replacement values for wildcards in the port portion of the URL must consist of one or more decimal digits.

[cols="25m,25m,10,40"]
.Port wildcard replacement
|===
| Pattern | Value | Valid | Reason

|\https://example.com:*
|\https://example.com:2012
|+++<i class="fas fa-check green-text"></i>+++
|&nbsp;

|\https://example.com:*
|\https://example.com:80b
|+++<i class="fas fa-times red-text"></i>+++
|The replacement value contains a non-numeric character

|===

=== Path Segments

Replacement values for wildcards in a path segment of the URL must not contain `/` or `?` characters.

[cols="25m,25m,10,40"]

|===
| Pattern | Value | Valid | Reason

|&nbsp;

|&nbsp;

|\https://example.com/path/*/resource
|\https://example.com/path/to/the/resource
|+++<i class="fas fa-times red-text"></i>+++
|The replacement value contains a `/`

|\https://example.com/path/*
|\https://example.com/path/resource?foo=bar
|+++<i class="fas fa-times red-text"></i>+++
|The replacement value contains a `?`

|\https://example.com/pass:[*]/par*tial/pass:[*]
|\https://example.com/path/partial/resource
|+++<i class="fas fa-times red-text"></i>+++
|The segment `partial` does not contain a replacement character for the wildcard

|===

=== Query String Values
