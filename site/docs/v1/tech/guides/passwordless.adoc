== What is passwordless

Passwordless authentication allows a user to prove their identity without a password.

With FusionAuth, passwordless authentication is by default implemented with a one use, timebound code, delivered by email. However, that is not the only option. If you need more customization, you can use the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/passwordless[passwordless API] to generate a code. Then you may deliver it by another method, such as an SMS or push notification.

This guide will cover the FusionAuth passwordless authentication implementation including standard configuration, APIs you may use to build a custom experience, and system settings. 

Here's a video showing the default passwordless process in FusionAuth:

== When does it make sense

Passwordless authentication eases a user's sign-in experience. Rather than having to remember which password they used, a user gives their email address and is sent a link. When they click through, they are authenticated.

In addition to being easier for users, a passwordless login experience prevents them from reusing the same password across different sites or applications. No longer will you worry about another website's data breach causing illicit access to your system. In addition, password brute forcing is no longer a threat since the codes are one time use.

== Setting up for passwordless

If you are planning to use passwordless, you have two options. You can either use the FusionAuth web pages. You can customize the theme to make them look like your application. The other option is using the passwordless API. Let's look at each in turn. 

In either case, you should:

* Configure your SMTP server settings under Tenants / Email. If you are testing this flow out locally, you may want to use https://mailcatcher.me/[mailcatcher].
* Create an application.
* Turn on "Passwordless Login" under Security tab of the application configuration:
image::guides/passwordless/turn-on-passwordless.png[Turn on passwordless login,width=500,role=box-shadow margin-right]
* Add a user and register them with your application. Make sure you register a valid email address.

Since, by default, passwordless authentication requires email delivery, ensure FusionAuth is correctly configured to send email. One way to test email delivery is by creating a user and sending them a password setup email.

== Using the FusionAuth user interface

Choose the FusionAuth UI if you want to use the link:/docs/v1/tech/oauth/#example-authorization-code-grant[Authorization Code grant]. Enabling passwordless adds an option for a user to receive an one time code. Because this is the Authorization Code grant, any library or framework that supports this OAuth grant will work.

To use this option:

* Go to your application configuration page in the administration UI.
* Configure the OAuth redirect URL as you would with any application where users authenticate password (link:/docs/v1/tech/oauth/[more on OAuth config here]). Make sure the Authorization Code grant is an enabled grant.

Now you're done with configuration.

To test out how your users would experience this:

* Go to your application login page and click the "Login with a magic link" button.
image::guides/passwordless/login-page-with-magic-link.png[The passwordless login magic link.,width=500,role=box-shadow margin-right]
* Enter the user's email.
image::guides/passwordless/passwordless-email-request-form.png[The passwordless email request form.,width=500,role=box-shadow margin-right]
* Go to the user's inbox.
* Click on the link.

As soon as the link is clicked, the user has begun an Authorization Code grant. You can link:/docs/v1/tech/oauth/#example-authorization-code-grant[consume the authorization code] using a library or your own code. Whatever you would normally do if someone signed in with a password, you can now do here. This means that you'll be provided with the same refresh tokens, user data or JWTs that would be delivered if the user had signed in with a password.

To customize the look of the login pages, use link:/docs/v1/tech/themes[themes]. While editing the theme, you could remove the username/password form. This would force everyone to use passwordless authentication. 

Since changing a theme modifies it across all applications in a tenant, this will also affect the FusionAuth and other applications, if the new application is in the default tenant. If you want to hide the username/password form on an application by application basis, use separate tenants.

=== Limits

Using the provided FusionAuth user interface will send the passwordless code via email. 

It also requires you to use the Authorization Code grant. 

== Using the API directly

While using the FusionAuth user interface works for many, you may need more control. You can use the passwordless API to authenticate a user with a one time code. The link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/passwordless[passwordless API reference docs] cover each of the API calls, but this guide will walk you through an implementation. 

There are a couple of reasons you might choose to this method of integration.

* You can customize every part of the user login experience.
* You can send the code using a different method such as a text message or Slack direct message.

When using this option, you must set up an link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication[API key] with the appropriate permissions. The minimum level of privilege required is the `POST` permission to the `/api/passwordless/start` endpoint.

=== Calling the API

There are four parts to the passwordless flow. 

1. You start the passwordless login via an API call to FusionAuth.
1. Deliver the code to the user.
1. The user enters the code.
1. You complete the passwordless login via an API call.

==== Starting the login

You start a passwordless login by calling the `/api/passwordless/start` endpoint.

[source,shell]
.Start Passwordless Login API call
----
API_KEY=...
REQUEST_PAYLOAD='{...}'
curl  -H "Content-type: application/json" -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" https://local.fusionauth.io/api/passwordless/start -d $REQUEST_PAYLOAD
----

Here's an example request payload:

[source,json]
.Start Passwordless Login Request JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/passwordless/start-request.json[]
----

The `state` parameter is optional. If present, it is provided to your application upon successful authentication. This allows an anonymous users to interact with your application, then log in and have data from their anonymous session available. 

For example, if you have a shopping site, you may want to allow a user to add items to their cart before they sign in. Once they have logged in, the `state` parameter can be used to associate their cart id with the authenticated user. In this case, the `state` key might be set to a JSON object like this:

[source,json]
----
{ "cart_id" : 1234 } 
----

The call to `/api/passwordless/start` begins the authentication process, and returns a response with a code: 

[source,json]
.Start Passwordless Login Response JSON 
----
include::docs/src/json/passwordless/start-response.json[]
----

Possession of this one time code authenticates the end user. Deliver this code to the end user using whatever method you'd like. If you want to use FusionAuth to deliver the code via email, see <<Sending the code using FusionAuth>>. 

==== Sending the code using FusionAuth

This is an optional passwordless API call. If you want to send the passwordless code via the email server configured in FusionAuth, you may use the `/api/passwordless/send` API endpoint. 

Using this API call allows you the benefits of the FusionAuth locale-aware email templates and email delivery capabilities without requiring you to use the FusionAuth login forms.

==== The user enters the code

Once the user possesses the code, they must provide it to your application. You must build an interface for them to do so. 

==== Completing the login

When the user provides the code to you, call the `/api/passwordless/login` endpoint. You can pass other information such as IP address, but the code is required.

[source,json]
.Complete Passwordless Login Request JSON 
----
include::docs/src/json/passwordless/start-response.json[]
----

If the code is valid, your application will receive user data, a JWT and other data based on the application configuration. If you sent a `state` parameter when starting the authentication process, it will also be included in the response, under the `state` key.

[source,json]
.Complete Passwordless Response JSON 
----
include::docs/src/json/users/passwordless-login-response.json[]
----

The user is now authenticated. Your application has user data, pre-existing state if provided, and a JWT which can be used to represent the user to other resources. If you want to send the JWT to a client as a cookie, you can now do so.

===== Additional passwordless login parameters

JWTs are typically passed to other systems like an API server to enable access to protected resources (link:/learn/expert-advice/tokens/[more about JWTs]). If you are using passwordless authentication and are not using the JWT, you can turn off its generation. Creating and signing the JWT and take server resources, so doing so will improve performance. 

To do so, set the `noJWT` parameter to true when you call the complete API endpoint. 

==== Common failure paths

Every time you start a passwordless login for a given user, all other codes for that user are marked invalid. Codes are also invalid after a configurable time limit. 

If a user provides a code that is invalid, if their account is locked or if there is any other issue in the request, a status code in the 400 range will be returned. Please consult the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/passwordless[passwordless API reference docs] for more details about return status codes.

== Two factor authentication

You can use FusionAuth passwordless authentication in combination with two factor authentication. XXX stopped here

When two factor auth is enabled for a user, after the one time code has been provided they are prompted to provide an additional two factor verification code. 

Learn more about setting up link:/docs/v1/tech/tutorials/two-factor/[two factor authentication].

=== 2fa and the passwordless API

Two factor authentication also works when <<Using the API directly>>. In that case, when you complete the passwordless authentication, instead of getting the user data, you'll get a code:

[source,json]
----
{"twoFactorId":"VnNILnXs_EDG-cjwokwITRApmAxCMkojeT3CUqqLhLc"}0
----

You then have to prompt the user for their two factor code from SMS or an application like Google Authenticator. Note that this is an entirely different code than the one time code used for the initial passwordless flow. Pass the `twoFactorId` and the two factor code to the `/api/two-factor/login` endpoint to link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/login#complete-two-factor-authentication[complete the two factor authentication].

If a user has previously completed a two factor authentication and has decided to trust the device, you may have a `twoFactorTrustId` value. This can be passed to the passwordless authentication complete endpoint. If valid, it will skip the two factor challenge.

== Customizing passwordless

You can configure the FusionAuth passwordless implementation to meet your application's needs in a number of ways.

=== Templates

If you are using the FusionAuth provided email templates, whether you are using the standard FusionAuth user interface or the `/api/passwordless/send` API call, you will need to customize them. Since the template references "FusionAuth", simply duplicate the template and modify it with your branding and messaging.

image::guides/passwordless/modifying-email-template.png[Modifying the passwordless email template.,width=500,role=box-shadow margin-right]

Then configure the tenant email template settings to use your passwordless login template.

image::guides/passwordless/update-tenant-with-new-template.png[Updating the tenant to use the new passwordless email template.,width=500,role=box-shadow margin-right]

You can use any Apache FreeMarker built-ins within the template. Make sure you modify both the HTML and text templates:

.The default passwordless HTML template
[source,text]
----
include::docs/src/email/passwordless.html[] 
----

.The default passwordless text template
[source,text]
----
include::docs/src/email/passwordless.txt[]
----

You can localize the template as well:

image::guides/passwordless/localization-screen-for-email-template.png[The localization screen for your email templates.,width=500,role=box-shadow margin-right]

More about link:/docs/v1/tech/email-templates[email templates]. 

=== One time code customization

You may modify the lifetime of the code sent to users. By default it is 180 seconds, but you can change this in the tenant settings.

image::guides/passwordless/tenant-settings.png[The tenant settings to customize code lifetime and generation strategy.,width=500,role=box-shadow margin-right]

You can also change the type of the code generated. Both the length of the code and the contents of the code may be customized. The current limits are:

TBD include framgment with limits

You may change your code length or content generation strategy for security or user experience reasons. You may have requirements that specify a certain code length. If you deliver the code by text message, having a user enter a six digit alphanumeric code sent to them by SMS is a lot easier than a 64 byte string. 

== Security

With passwordless authentication, if the user’s email account is hijacked, their account on your system is compromised. However, many organizations have heightend security policies and protections around email account passwords. It is often easier to protect and regularly change an email account password than to change all of a user's passwords. Email accounts are also more likely to have two factor authentication enabled.

One way to increase the security of your passwordless authentications is to decrease the lifetime of the code. This will help if the email is compromised or accidentally forwarded. 

There are no limits on how many passwordless requests can be placed for a single email address, but only the most recent code is valid. Any of the others, even if they have not yet expired, will display an `Invalid login credentials` message to the user if provided.

If someone tries to use an email that is not present in the FusionAuth user database, they'll see the same notification as they would if the email existed, but no email message will be sent.

If you use the API, follow the principle of lease privilege and lock down the calls to which the API key has access. If all you are using the API key for is passwordless login, then don't associate any other permissions with this key.

=== What about user's passwords

When FusionAuth is your user datastore, when you add a user, you must provide a password or send them a link to reset their password. 

If you are requiring passwordless authentication, rather than just offering it as an option, set the user's initial password to a long string of random characters. Since they won't be using it, it doesn't matter how long it is.
