== What Are Basic Registration Forms

Basic registration forms let you get user registration up and running quickly and simply with no coding required.

You might be interested in this feature if you have a straightforward registration process, where all you need are a few pieces of common user information to register a new user. Basic registration forms are a single step.

If you are building your own login and registration pages using the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/[APIs], you can still use the basic registration setup in the administrative user interface, but you will have to generate the user facing HTML from the configured form data and recreate any front end logic. You may want to consider using the themeable hosted login pages instead.

== How Do I Use Basic Registration Forms?

Here's a video showing setup and use of the basic registration forms feature.

To use basic registration forms, you must:

* Create a tenant and application
* Configure email SMTP server details
* Enable and configure registration on the application

== Building a Basic Form Registration Flow

Let's create a basic registration form for an application that requires:

* Email
* Password
* First name
* Optional last name.

These fields are already available in the set of basic registration field every FusionAuth installation, and only need to have their respective "Enabled" and "Required" switches toggled.

We'll go through the entire process, from creating a new application in Fusion Auth, to registering a new user.

=== Create a new Fusion Auth Tenant and Application

In order to register a User, you must have first installed Fusion Auth and created a Tenant and Application.

A guide to getting started with installing Fusion Auth is provided in the link:/docs/v1/tech/getting-started[Getting Started Guide]

A tutorial for creating an application is provided in the link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/applications[Application overview]. Once the Application has been created, you can setup the basic registration options.

== Configure the Tenant Email Server

A vital part of registration is validating a user's email address, as well as being able to send password reset emails, or critical account information.

For that, you will need to configure SMTP email server credentials for your tenant. Log in to the FusionAuth administrative user interface.

Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Tenants -> Your Tenant# and then select the [breadcrumb]#Email# tab. Scroll to the [breadcrumb]#SMTP settings# section. Configure this with your SMTP server information. If you are testing locally, you can use a mock email server like https://mailcatcher.me/[mailcatcher].

Ensure a test email is delivered. If you have any issues, follow the steps in the link:/docs/v1/tech/admin-guide/troubleshooting#troubleshooting-email[email troubleshooting documentation].

Save the configuration.

=== Configuring Basic Registration

To set up Basic Registration, navigate to the Applications tab, and select the "Edit" icon to open the edit page.

Then navigate to the [breadcrumb]#Registration# tab. Then scroll down to the "Self Service Registration" section. Toggle the "Enabled" switch on.

The "Type" radio button should have "Basic" selected. Leave it on this setting.

You can toggle on the "Verify Password" switch to ask the user to enter their password twice when creating an account to ensure it is captured correctly.

Leave the "Login type" radio button set on "Email".

Then set the "Registration Fields" as follows:

- First name "Enabled" and "Required" on
- Last name "Enabled" on and "Required" off.

Set all the other fields to "Enabled" off.

The settings should now look like this:

=== Configuring Registration Verification Settings

You can configure additional settings around registration verification. Scroll up to the [breadcrumb]#Registration Verification Settings# section, just above the "Registration Fields" section.

Here you can specify if a registration verification email should be sent to the user. Toggling the "Verify registrations" switch on will reveal some further options.

You can choose the email template to send for registration verification. Choose the "[FusionAuth Default] Registration Verification" template.

For the "Verification Strategy" option, you can choose to send a link in the verification email to the user, or to send a short code that they can type in the registration form to verify their account.

If you choose to send a short code, you must also set the "Unverified behaviour" option to "Gated". Note that the "Gated" behaviour option, and thus the short code option, is only available with a valid license key. Please visit link:/pricing[our pricing page] to review paid edition options and buy a license.

Your verification settings should now look like this:

image::guides/basic-registration-forms/registration-verification-settings.png[Registration Verification Settings,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Save all changes to the application.

=== Register a User

Now that the application has been configured, you can register a user. Navigate to the [breadcrumb]#Applications list# page. Click on the green button with the magnifying glass icon next to yout application to open the details popup.

Scroll down to the "Registration URL" item, and copy the URL. This is the page that your users will be redirected to when they click the "Register" button.

Open the url in a new tab, and follow the instructions to register a user.

After registering, you should receive an email with a verification link. Click the link to verify the user.

=== View the User
After you have registered as a user, you can view the user in the FusionAuth user management interface. Navigate to the [breadcrumb]#Users# page, by clicking the "Users" link in the left-hand navigation.

You should see the newly registered user in the list.

== Advanced Registration Forms

Basic registration is a quick and simple way to get started. However, if your application requires custom data to be captured at registration, or other advanced capabilities, you can use advanced registration forms.

With advanced registration forms, in addition to registering a user to an application, you can also:

* Collect additional profile data and store it in FusionAuth.
* Validate any field on the server in a variety of ways, including matching a regular expression.
* Use more complicated fields, such as consents and confirmation fields.
* Break a registration process into a series of less imposing steps.

A guide to setting up advanced registration forms is provided at  link:/docs/v1/tech/guides/advanced-registration-forms[Advanced Registration Forms].
