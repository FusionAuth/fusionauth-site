When you first add an MFA method to a user, the response is a set of codes:

[source,json]
.Recovery Codes Response JSON
----
include::../../../src/json/two-factor/response-with-recovery-codes.json[]
----

These should be presented to the user to store for safekeeping. They are one time use only and may be used any time a `code` parameter is required in an MFA flow. If valid, FusionAuth considers the additional factor provided and marks the recovery code used. 

As a developer, you can manage them via the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/two-factor/#retrieve-recovery-codes[Recovery Code API] as well.

These recovery codes are useful if a user loses their device or their email account access. By presenting a recovery code, the user may log in to their account even if they've lost access to their MFA method of choice.
