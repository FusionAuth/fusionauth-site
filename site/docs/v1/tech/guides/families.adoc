The family API in FusionAuth is a powerful way to logically group users who are family members. It also pairs nicely with the consent API to manage consents provided by parents to children. You can review the link:../apis/families[family API] for detailed API documentation. Here's what this guide will cover.

* <<Example application>>
* <<Limitations>>

== Why would you use families?

There are two main reasons to use the family API. The first is to add family relationships to your application. You can create associations and assign roles to enable your application to offer different functionality for each family member. These relationships may be complex; for example, a child may be a member of multiple families, each headed by different adults.

The second reason for using the family API is because you are legally obligated to obtain parental consent. This varies with the age of your users and what you are doing with their data. FusionAuth can help you send emails to verify consent and record what consent is given to each user by whom. While restrictions and age limits vary by legal jurisdiction, applications may require parental consent. 

== Setting up family management

To get started with the family workflows, enable the family settings in the Tenant settings. 

Go to [breadcrumb]#Tenants -> Default -> Family# and click `enable`. Do this for each tenant where you'd like to access family functionality.

image::guides/families/default-family-settings.png[Default family settings,width=700,role=box-shadow margin-right]

Make sure your `Maximum child age` and `Minimum owner age` values are set appropriately. The defaults are correct for most jurisdictions in the USA, but the correct values depend on your legal jurisdiction. If you are serving different countries with different ages, you'll need different tenants, as these values are set on a tenant basis.

Different use cases will require modifying additional Tenant attributes, but for now let's leave the defaults and look at some use cases.

== Use cases

We'll cover the following use cases:

* <<Family management>>
* <<Parental approval>>
* <<Legal consent frameworks>> such as COPPA

=== Family management

You may want to use the family APIs to create a family and associate users with that family. You can then treat the family as an atomic unit for certain purposes, such as billing. At the same time, your application can offer different functionality to each user, such as their own playlist, if this were a content streaming application such as Netflix.

Each user account is independent, with its own data, login identifier, and password. Users are associated with the family by actions of the owner. Consent is implied in the act of creation and doesn't need to be recorded in the system (though there's nothing preventing that).

==== Creating and adding family members 

Families are created implicitly, by adding associating an existing user with a family. To do so, create a FusionAuth application using the link:../apis/applications[Application API] and a user with the link:../apis/users[User API]. Or, use the administrative user interface to create these objects. Make sure the user's age is greater than the `Minimum owner age` specified in the Tenant settings.

Then, create a family with this user as the first member by `POST`ing to the link:../apis/families#create-a-family[`/api/user/family`] endpoint. Here's an example with curl:

[source,shell]
.Creating a Family
----
API_KEY=...
REQUEST_PAYLOAD='{...}'
curl -XPOST -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" https://local.fusionauth.io/api/user/family -d $REQUEST_PAYLOAD
----

The first user of a family must be both an adult and an owner. Here's an example request payload:

[source,json]
.Create Family Request JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/family/request.json[]
----

Here's a typical response, which includes the id of the newly created family:

[source,json]
.Create Family Response JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/family/response.json[]
----

After family creation, there is only one family member. That usually is insufficient. Your application can add family members as needed. Make sure the user you want to add to the family exists; using the User API if required. Adding users to a family is similar to first creating a family. The main differences include:

* You provide the existing family id
* You use the `PUT` HTTP method instead of the `POST` method
* You can add users with any family role: `Adult`, `Teen` or `Child`.

[source,shell]
.Adding a Child to a Family
----
API_KEY=...
REQUEST_PAYLOAD='{...}'
curl -XPUT -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" https://local.fusionauth.io/api/user/family -d $REQUEST_PAYLOAD
----

Here's an example request payload:
[source,json]
.Add A Child To A Family Request JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/family/request-child.json[]
----

You cannot add more than one user at a time to a family. After adding each user, the entire family object is returned Here's an example response payload returned after adding a child to an existing family:

[source,json]
.Add A Child To A Family Response JSON

include::docs/src/json/family/response-after-child-added.json[]

===== Allowing a Child to Request an Account

[NOTE]
====
This section only applies if you are using the FusionAuth OAuth login and registration templates and want to allow a child to ask their parents for an account.
====

To allow a child to request an account: 

* Enable self service registrations in the application configuration.
* Disable child registrations in the tenant settings.
* Create a email template to be sent to a parent. A sample is below.
* Update the `Family request template` setting to that email template. If the value for that email template is not set, then no email will be sent. 

Once this is configured, FusionAuth requires a birthdate during registration. If the user registering is under the `Maximum child age` setting, then they'll see a message prompting them to enter their parent's email address.

image::guides/families/parent-request-no-child-allowed.png[Form for a child requesting an account from a parent,width=700,role=box-shadow margin-right]

If the child submits an email address, presumably for their parents, the email based on the template you configured will be sent. To resend this email, use the link:../apis/families#request-parental-approval[Request Parental Approval] API.

Here's an example of an `Family request template` email:

.Sample Family Registration Request HTML Template
[source,text]
----
include::docs/src/email/family-registration.html[]
----

Customize and localize this email template as required. Please see the link:../email-templates/email-templates[Email Templates documentation] for variables accessible in the template as well as more information about email templates in general. 

==== Retrieving family members

At some point in your application, you'll likely want to retrieve family members. An example might be if you wanted to display all the associated users. Think of the first screen of Netflix when you choose which account to log in as.

To find family members, the application must start with either a user id or a family id. 

[source,shell]
.Retrieving a Family By Family Id
----
API_KEY=...
FAMILY_ID=a815b480-d52d-4755-96ac-749c067925d7
curl -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" 'https://local.fusionauth.io/api/user/family/'$FAMILY_ID
----

[source,shell]
.Retrieving a Family By User Id
----
API_KEY=...
USER_ID=b3360a2d-e81d-4314-b9f1-244a916ca52f
curl -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" 'https://local.fusionauth.io/api/user/family?userId='$USER_ID
----

Here's an example response payload, containing all the family information as well as the members:

[source,json]
.Retrieve Family Response JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/family/response-after-child-added.json[]
----

You can also use the administrative user interface. Go to [breadcrumb]#Users# and then view a user's details page. Navigate to the Family tab to see family members. You may navigate to each family member's details page from this tab as well.

image::guides/families/display-family-members-admin-ui.png[Display of family members in the administrative user interface,width=700,role=box-shadow margin-right]

==== Update family members 

You might do update a family member if their role has changed. FusionAuth does not automatically change the role of a family member based on their age.

[source,shell]
.Little e4440a4d Is All Grown Up, Let's Mark Them As a Teenager
----
API_KEY=...
FAMILY_ID=a815b480-d52d-4755-96ac-749c067925d7
REQUEST_PAYLOAD='{...}'
curl -XPUT -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" https://local.fusionauth.io/api/user/family/
----

Here's an example request payload:

[source,json]
.Update Family Member Request JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/family/request-update-child.json[]
----

Here's an example response payload, indicating that indeed, the user's family role has changed:

[source,json]
.Update Family Member Response JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/family/response-after-child-updated.json[]
----

==== Removing family members and families

You may also remove users from a family. If someone signs up for their own account, they may no longer need a user account on the family plan, for example. 

[source,shell]
.Removing a Family Member 
----
API_KEY=...
FAMILY_ID=a815b480-d52d-4755-96ac-749c067925d7
USER_TO_REMOVE=e4440a4d-b81d-4314-c9f1-844a916ca52f
curl -XDELETE -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" 'https://local.fusionauth.io/api/user/family/'$FAMILY_ID'/'$USER_TO_REMOVE
----

You can't delete a family object. Just as families are implicitly created, they are deleted implicitly. If you remove all members of a family, it becomes unavailable. Any API call against the deleted family will fail. For example, if you attempt to retrieve it, a 404 will be returned.

=== Parental approval

In contrast with the previous use case, in this scenario, a child creates an account but has no or limited access until a parent has approved the signup. A parent may or may not have an account, but if they do not, they'll be prompted to create one. At the end of the parental approval use case, both parent and child will have FusionAuth user accounts. 

If you do not want a parent to have an account, but need their approval recorded, you may create a shadow account for them. A parent need not ever log in to such a shadow account, but it will be used to, for example, record if they provided consent to the child.

Depending on your application, you may make limited application functionality available to a child before consent is granted. Think of a game aimed at children like Roblox. Some functionality may be available on registration, such as solo gameplay. Other functionality may be unlocked by parental approval, for example in-game chat. Unlike the previous use case, parental consent is not implied in the account creation, so you must record it if you need a record of it.

Parents approve signups by receiving an email and clicking on a link. FusionAuth sends the email, but you need to make sure the content of the email is correct, including the link. Additionally, your application must handle the click.

This scenario only differs from the previous use case in how users are added to a family and how consent is recorded. The process for updating and removing family members is unchanged. 

==== Setting up the email

Create or update the required email templates. The first is the `Confirm child account template` and the second is the `Parent registration request template`. Which email template is used depends on if the parent has an account.

The `Confirm child account template` is sent when a parent already has an account and merely needs to confirm the child's account creation. The `Parent registration request template`, on the other hand, is sent when a parent has no account and must register. You cannot resend these emails.

If the Tenant settings for these templates are not set, no emails will be sent; in this case, the system assumes the application will confirm child accounts using some other notification method, such as a mobile push notification or SMS. Here are sample email templates:

.Sample Confirm Child Email HTML Template
[source,text]
----
include::docs/src/email/confirm-child.html[]
----

.Sample Parent Registration Request HTML Template
[source,text]
----
include::docs/src/email/parent-registration.html[]
----

You may customize and localize these templates as required. Please see the link:../email-templates/email-templates[Email Templates documentation] for variables accessible in the template as well as more information.

[NOTE]
====
Before version 1.17.2 there was a link:https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/685[bug affecting template variables] in these emails. The link contains the workaround.
====

==== Registering the child

Once the email has been sent, you can register the child. This is what the API call looks like:

[source,shell]
.Registering a Child With Parental Consent
----
API_KEY=...
REQUEST_PAYLOAD='{...}'
curl -XPUT -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" https://local.fusionauth.io/api/user -d $REQUEST_PAYLOAD
----

Here's an example request payload:

[source,json]
.Registering a Child With Parental Consent Request JSON 
----
include::docs/src/json/user-registrations/combined-request-parental-consent.json[]
----

Provide the parent's email address and the child's birthday as well as the more typical application, email and password information. As soon as you create the child account, one of the above emails will be sent. 

At this point, the path forks. Suppose the parent has an account. In this case, the `Confirm child account template` email will be sent. This email should contain a link. On clicking that link, you should either display the child account to confirm or confirm the account. 

If the parent has no account, the `Parent registration request template` email is sent. This prompts the parent to register. 

In both these cases, the page on the other side of the link in the customized email template must be built by you. You as the application developer are responsible for handling that what happens when the user clicks that link.

==== Building a page to capture parental approval

When the link in the email is clicked by a parent, they must register or log in to your application, as mentioned above. After they do so, present the parent with the list of child accounts to confirm.

You can retrieve the list of child accounts by calling an API to retrieve pending family members:

[source,shell]
.Retrieving Pending Family Members
----
API_KEY=...
PARENT_EMAIL_ADDRESS=parent@example.com

curl -XGET -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" 'http://local.fusionauth.io/api/user/family/pending?parentEmail='$PARENT_EMAIL_ADDRESS
----

This will return a list of `User` objects corresponding to the unconfirmed, associated child user accounts. Make sure this page is protected.

You may then add them to the family using the sames APIs as you would in the <<Family management>> scenario. Adding a child to the family will remove the `parentEmail` field from the child `User` object. The `parentEmail` field is an indicator that the child has not yet been added as a family member.

==== After confirmation

When the child is confirmed as part of the family, you may want to capture more information about that consent. You have a couple options:

- You can create and record a consent using the link:../apis/consent[Consent API]. This is the recommended choice.
- You can record this action elsewhere in your application. For example, confirmation page could call a custom API.
- You can add the date, type and other consent information to the `user.data` field of the child account.
- You could treat membership in a family as the record of consent.

Creating a consent object is the preferred method to capture a record of the parental consent. Using this API has the following benefits:

* You can create multiple kinds of consents for different purposes. 
* You can retrieve all consents for a given user, including the time they were created or updated.
* Consents may be granularly granted and revoked.

In general, recording a consent using the Consent API gives you more flexibility than the other options. 

==== Using consents

When using consents, your application captures how and when parental consent was provided. You may retrieve consents for any user. You can build a user interface to allow a parent to temporarily or permanently revoke a consent.

Consents are a different API than families. In fact, a user doesn't need to be part of a family to grant consent to another user or themselves. If you're using the Consent API to capture parental consent, you'll want to validate that:

* the user granting consent is in the same family as the user recieving it
* if the user receiving consent is a child, the user granting consent is a parent

If a user is less than the `Maximum child age` at the time of consent, they will not be able to grant consent to themselves. If a user is older, they can self consent.

To use a consent, create a consent. You can do that via the administrative user interface. For this guide, create consent called 'Email consent'. Leave the other settings at their default values, but consult the link:../apis/consent[Consent API] documentation for more information on the various options.

image::guides/families/add-consent.png[Adding a custom consent,width=700,role=box-shadow margin-right]

When the parent confirms the child's account, create a user consent, capturing the consent grant. The following curl command will do so, though you can of course use the link:../client-libraries[client libraries]:

[source,shell]
.Granting Consent 
----
API_KEY=...
REQUEST_PAYLOAD='{...}'

curl -XPOST -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" 'http://local.fusionauth.io/api/user/consent' -d $REQUEST_PAYLOAD
----

Here's an example request payload:

[source,json]
.Granting Consent Request JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/user-consent/request.json[]
----

Here's an typical response:

[source,json]
.Granting Consent Response JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/user-consent/response-no-email-plus.json[]
----

The consent is now granted. In your application, pull the consents for a given user at login or any other time to determine the appropriate level of access. You may also pull it for reporting or other purposes. 

==== Unverified children

If a child registers and the parent never confirms their account, FusionAuth can delete the child accounts automatically, after a certain number of days. Or you can keep the accounts indefinitely, if that works better for you. These are settings in the Family tab of the Tenant details page.

==== Using the FusionAuth OAuth interface

While this guide has focused on the APIs, using these requires integrating with your own user interface. You can also use the FusionAuth OAuth interface for registration and login. To do so, in addition to the settings mentioned in <<Setting up family management>>, change the following settings:
 
* Enable the self service registration on the application
* Enable `Allow child registrations on the tenant`
* Enable `Parent email required during registration`

[NOTE]
====
This section only applies if you are using the FusionAuth OAuth interface.
====

With these settings, FusionAuth will prompt anyone registering for their birth date. This will happen before any other registration forms are presented.

image::guides/families/register-birth-date.png[Form requiring a registering user to enter their birth date,width=700,role=box-shadow margin-right]

If the entered birth date indicates the user is under the `Maximum child age` configured in the Tenant Family tab, a parental email address will be required.

image::guides/families/register-prompt-parent-email.png[Form for a child registering and requesting consent from a parent,width=700,role=box-shadow margin-right]

Just as when you use the APIs directly, if a child registers using these themed pages, the parent will be emailed; the template used will be the `Parent registration request template` if they are not registered, but if they are, the `Confirm child account template` email will be sent.

When the parent registers, your application must display the pending family members using your own API calls, as well as allow parents approve or disapprove them. If you'd like to modify the registration pages to look like your own application, link:../themes[modify the tenant theme].

==== Updating and removing members

There are no difference in the process to update or remove family members in this use case. It is the same as the <<Family management>> use case.

=== Legal consent frameworks 

For applications targetted at young children, laws come into play. For example the https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA], in the USA and the https://gdpr-info.eu/art-8-gdpr/[General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR] in the EU both outline specific requirements for informed parental consent when applications provide certain types of online activities at children.

FusionAuth allows you to build custom consent frameworks, as shown above, but also supports COPPA. If you're building a child-directed game (that is, one aimed at children) in the USA, and you'll be collecting data about the children for such purposes as marketing and gameplay improvement, you need to comply with COPPA.

This guide will focus on COPPA; please check your local laws for child consent requirements.

==== COPPA support

There are two different ways for companies to comply with COPPA, according to the FTC. Which you choose depends on how you're going to use the data. You can use verified parental consent (VPC) or "email plus". While FusionAuth supports both, the COPPA "email plus" compliance method is available out of the box and is the more common method.

==== COPPA consent

The only difference between COPPA and <<Parental approval>> is in how the consent is obtained. COPPA "email plus" consent requires two emails to be sent at different times, to ensure parents have ample opportunity to grant or revoke consent. To enable the COPPA consent, navigate to 
[breadcrumb]#Settings -> Consents -> COPPA Email+#, review the provided `COPPA Email+` consent and make needed changes.

image::guides/families/coppa-email-plus-consent.png[The default COPPA consent,width=700,role=box-shadow margin-right]

Review the COPPA email templates for language and branding. Modify them so that they point to the correct application URL to grant consent when a parent clicks a link. Here are the sample email templates.

.The COPPA Notice
[source,text]
----
include::docs/src/email/coppa-notice.html[]
----

.The Email Plus COPPA Notice
[source,text]
----
include::docs/src/email/coppa-plus-notice.html[]
----

When a child is verified by a parent and added to the family, create the COPPA consent. Here's an example of how you might do so:

[source,shell]
.Granting Consent 
----
API_KEY=...
REQUEST_PAYLOAD='{...}'

curl -XPOST -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" 'http://local.fusionauth.io/api/user/consent' -d $REQUEST_PAYLOAD
----

Here's an example request payload:

[source,json]
.Granting Consent Request JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/user-consent/request.json[]
----

Here is a typical successful response:

[source,json]
.Granting Consent Response JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/user-consent/response.json[]
----

For a user who is older than a child but not yet an adult, your application may allow them to perform self consent. In that case the `giverUserId` and the `userId` for the consent request would be the same `userId`, that of the teenager.

==== Revocation

There will be two reminder emails sent. In either one, a parent may login and and view the granted consents for their family or the given user. You as the application developer should build this view. In it, a parent should be able to grant or revoke consent for any child in the family.

Here's how you'd revoke a previously granted consent, using curl:

[source,shell]
.Revoking Consent 
----
API_KEY=...

curl -v -XDELETE -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" 'http://local.fusionauth.io/api/user/consent/841d8b33-bf4d-488d-9f2f-2f50d769c3d2' 
----

Here's the response you'll receive on successful revocation. Note that `status` has changed:

[source,json]
.Revoked Consent Response JSON 
----
include::docs/src/json/user-consent/response-revoked.json[]
----

To create an audit log of the consents granted or revoked, you could use record the information yourself or use the link:../apis/audit-logs[Audit Log API]. In either case, do this at the same time as you call the consent API.

When you are determining access to various parts of your application, you'll need to know which consents have been granted for a user. You might do this if a user was trying to access the chat section of your application, for example. Retrieve this data after the child has signed in and prevent the child from accessing parts of the application if consent has been revoked.

[source,shell]
.Listing User Consents
----
API_KEY=...

curl -XGET -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" 'http://local.fusionauth.io/api/user/consent?userId=841d8b33-bf4d-488d-9f2f-2f50d769c3d2'
----

This call responds with this JSON when the consent has been granted:

[source,json]
.Listing Consent Response JSON When Consent Granted
----
include::docs/src/json/user-consent/response.json[]
----

This is the response when consent has been revoked (note the different value for the `status` key:

[source,json]
.Listing Consent Response JSON When Consent Revoked
----
include::docs/src/json/user-consent/response-revoked.json[]
----

[NOTE]
====
This means that you need to check the value of the consent `status`, not just whether the consent exists.
====

== Alternatives

If you don't need to model family relationships, but instead want to associate arbitrary users, consider link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/groups[Groups].

If you want to tie permissions in your application to users or groups of users, but don't need to worry about parent child relationships, consider link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/roles[Roles].

== Example application

There is an https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-family[example nodejs application] which allows for confirmation of child accounts and granting and revocation of parental consent.

== Limitations

There are three family roles available:

* `Adult`
* `Child`
* `Teen`

These roles have no relationship to the birth date of a user. These roles are assigned by your application. If you want to categorize a 25 year old as a teenager, FusionAuth won't stop you. Ages are only checked for the family creator; the first user added to a family must be older than the `Minimum owner age`. All other owners, however, may be any age. Family roles have no relationship whatsoever to application roles, beyond the fact they share the name `role`. 

A family consists of at least one adult, and an arbitrary number of teens, children and other adults.

Families are displayed in the administrative user interface. You can configure settings related to families as detailed above in the administrative user interface as well. But families can not be created or modified with this interface. If you are going to use families, you're going to be writing code against the APIs, either directly or using the client libraries. 

Most family configuration is set at the tenant level. If you require different configurations, you need multiple tenants. For example, if the `Maximum child age` is 12 for one application and 15 for another, you can't manage them in the same FusionAuth tenant. However, creating multiple tenants in one FusionAuth installation is simple; see the link:../apis/tenants[Tenants APIs] for more information.

Users with the `Child` or `Teen` family roles may belong to more than one family, but a user with the `Adult` role may only belong to one family.
