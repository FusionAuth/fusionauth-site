The main limits on tenants in FusionAuth are resources of the underlying server. The tenants are lightweight, but do take some resources. There are FusionAuth instances supporting thousands of FusionAuth tenants. At this scale the FusionAuth administrative user interface runs into some issues, so use one of the link:/docs/v1/tech/client-libraries/[client libraries] to manage the tenants and applications. There's a https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/374[GitHub issue] to resolve these limits in the administrative user interface.

Another current limitation of FusionAuth with respect to tenants is the ability to limit users who log into the administrative user interface to a single tenant. This is not currently supported. There's a https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-issues/issues/91[GitHub issue] to add that feature.

Login records, audit logs and other log files are not separated by tenant. You may be able to query based on tenant or application Ids, but if you need true isolation of log files, you should run separate instances. There's a https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/922[GitHub issue] to address this.

CORS settings are not configurable by tenant, nor are other settings configured by navigating to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> System#.

Applications and other tenant scoped entities cannot be shared across tenants. If you need to keep such entities in sync, you can write scripts to sync up the configuration of multiple applications across tenants. For users, you may be able to have users federate to an external identity provider, and enable that provider for applications across tenants. This will allow your external identity provider to be the system of record for your users.

The default tenant, in which the FusionAuth application resides, cannot be removed.
