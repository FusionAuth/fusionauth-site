title: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
description: Enabling MFA in FusionAuth as a developer.
---

== Overview

This guide will help you understand multi-factor authentication in FusionAuth, including how to implement it for initial login and step up auth. These additional factors help ensure the system authenticates users correctly. This is also known as MFA or Two Factor Authentication.

* <<Types of MFA Supported>>
* <<Tenant Set Up>>
* <<Enabling MFA on a User>>
* <<The End User Login Experience with MFA>>
* <<Step Up Auth>>
* <<Disabling MFA on a User>>
* <<Resending Codes>>
* <<Recovery Codes>>
* <<Migration from Version 1.25 and Earlier>>
* <<Integrating Other MFA Methods>>

== Types of MFA Supported

Currently there are three methods or factors of multi-factor authentication supported.

* TOTP/Google Authenticator
* Email
* SMS, including Twilio

include::docs/v1/tech/shared/_premium-edition-blurb.adoc[]

**However, the Authenticator/TOTP implementation is not a premium feature.**

include::docs/v1/tech/shared/_difference-two-factor-multi-factor.adoc[]

== Tenant Set Up

For each tenant, you must enable each factor of authentication you want to allow a user to use, including any configuration around email or SMS messengers. 

If you want to only use step up auth, you do not have to enable any MFA methods on the tenant. If you are using the hosted login pages or the login API, you need to enable MFA methods on the tenant.

Below all supported methods are enabled. If a method is not allowed in the tenant configuration, it will not be allowed for any user in the tenant.

image::guides/multi-factor-authentication/tenant-settings-mfa.png[Configuring allowed MFA methods on the tenant.,width=1200]

Please see the link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/tenants/#multi-factor[Tenant documentation for more information].

== Enabling MFA on a User

Once you've configured your tenant settings, you can enable one or more MFA methods on a user. Because this involves sharing secrets and verifying posession of email accounts or mobile phones, you cannot do this via the FusionAuth administrative user interface. Instead, you can use the API to do this.

If you have a paid edition, users can also use the new self service account management to enable MFA for their accounts. link:/docs/v1/tech/account-management/[Learn more about that here.]

This follows the same steps for every method:

* If using TOTP, optionally generate a shared secret to present to the user
* Start the MFA process by sending a code to the user
* Build a page which can accept that code

=== Generate a Shared Secret

This is only used by the TOTP method. If you are using another MFA method, skip this section. 

Using this API is not required, you may optionally build your own secret, the API is provided for convenienc

[source,shell]
.Generate a Shared Secret Script
----
API_KEY=...

curl -XGET -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" 'https://local.fusionauth.io/api/two-factor/secret'
----

Here's a sample response:

[source,json]
.Generate a Shared Secret Response JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/two-factor/secret/response.json[]
----

=== Send a Code to the User For Message Based MFA

You now need to verify the user has the other factor of authentication. For email and SMS methods, you send a code to the user using the Send API. 

[source,shell]
.Send a Code Script
----
API_KEY=...
REQUEST_PAYLOAD='{...}'

curl -XPOST -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" 'https://local.fusionauth.io/api/two-factor/send' -d $USER_ID -d $REQUEST_PAYLOAD
----

[source,json]
.Send a Code Script Request JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/two-factor/send/enable-userId-request.json[]
----

This will send a unique code to the user. The lifetime and length of this code can be configured by navigating to [breadcrumb]#Tenants -> Your Tenant -> Advanced# and modifying the [field]#Two-Factor One Time Code# settings.

=== Present the Shared Secret to the User for TOTP Based MFA

You must present the shared secret to the user for TOTP MFA. This can be presented as a QR code or a string of digits to enter into an application such as Google Authenticator or Authy. 

Unless you are using the self service account management, this is a page you'll have to build in your application.

=== Receive the Code

Once the code has been sent or the secret shared, you must build a page to accept the user's input. In case of message based MFA methods, the user must enter the code they've been sent. In the case of TOTP, they must enter the code provided by their application after entering the shared secret.

Unless you are using the self service account management, this is a page you'll have to build in your application.

At this point, you can send the code to FusionAuth and enable MFA for this user.

[source,shell]
.Enable MFA Script for the Email Method
----
API_KEY=...
USER_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000004
REQUEST_PAYLOAD='{...}'

curl -XPOST -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" 'https://local.fusionauth.io/api/user/two-factor/'$USER_ID -d $REQUEST_PAYLOAD
----

[source,json]
.Enable MFA for the Email Method Request JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/two-factor/enable-email-request.json[]
----

If you view the user in the administrative user interface, you will see that the user has an MFA method attached to their account:

image::guides/multi-factor-authentication/enabled-mfa.png[The MFA settings in the user details view when the first MFA method has been enabled.,width=1200]

At this point, the user has MFA enabled and will be prompted to provide another factor of authentication whenever they login. Below you can see that prompt when using the hosted login pages.

image::guides/multi-factor-authentication/code-sent-after-user-mfa-enabled.png[The MFA prompt screen at login.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

To enable TOTP based MFA, you use a slightly different request body, which includes a code the user provides as well as the shared secret which you have.

[source,shell]
.Enable MFA Script for TOTP Method
----
API_KEY=...
USER_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000004
REQUEST_PAYLOAD='{...}'

curl -XPOST -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" 'https://local.fusionauth.io/api/user/two-factor/'$USER_ID -d $REQUEST_PAYLOAD
----

[source,json]
.Enable MFA for TOTP Method Request JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/two-factor/enable-authenticator-request.json[]
----

When this happens, the user will be prompted to choose an MFA method at login:

image::guides/multi-factor-authentication/authentication-challenge-multiple-factors.png[MFA prompt screen at login, with multiple factors enabled.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

If you view the user in the administrative user interface, you will see that the user has a second MFA method attached to their account:

image::guides/multi-factor-authentication/enabled-second-factor.png[The MFA settings in the user details view when a second MFA method has been enabled.,width=1200]

Using this process, users can attach as many MFA methods of each type to their account.

=== Recovery Codes

When you first add a MFA method, the response will be a set of codes:

[source,json]
.Recovery Codes Response JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/two-factor/response-with-recovery-codes.json[]
----

These are one time use codes. These should be presented to the user for them to save. You can also manage them via the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/two-factor/#retrieve-recovery-codes[Recovery Code API].

These recovery codes may be used anywhere a `code` parameter is required. If valid, the system will proceed as if a valid MFA code was presented and mark the code as used.

== The End User Login Experience with MFA

Once MFA is enabled for a user, they'll need to provide the additional factor whenever they login.

=== Hosted Login Pages

If you are using the hosted login pages, there are two MFA specific theme templates you'll want to modify.

* The "OAuth two-factor methods" template displays the page where a user may choose between various MFA methods.
* The "OAuth two-factor" template displays the page where a user enters a code.

You can learn more about themes and templates, including the variables available for each page, in the link:/docs/v1/tech/themes/[themes documentation].

=== Building Your Own Screens

If you are not using the hosted login pages, you'll build your own pages using the Login API. In that case, you'll want to use the following flow:

* Login 
* Send the code
* Completing the Login

Let's walk through each of these steps.

==== Log the User In

Here you'll want to use the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/login/[Login API]. Please consult that documentation for full details.

[source,shell]
.Log the User In Script
----
API_KEY=...
REQUEST_PAYLOAD='{...}'

curl -XPOST -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" 'https://local.fusionauth.io/api/login' -d $REQUEST_PAYLOAD
----

[source,json]
.Log the User In Request JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/login/request.json[]
----

You'll get back a `242` response status code. This is your cue that the user has MFA enabled. You'll also get back response JSON with a list of their methods.

[source,json]
.Log the User In Response JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/login/login-two-factor-response.json[]
----

You'll need to save off the [field]#twoFactorId# as you'll need that later. You'll also want to save the `methods` array as you'll need to present that to the end user to let them choose their preferred MFA option.

You'll need to implement the page letting a user choose an MFA option.

When they have done so, you'll want to send a message if they are using a message based MFA method (such as email or SMS). 

==== Sending the Code

This is only required if the user chooses a message based MFA method. Using this invalidates any other codes previously sent to the user.

Here you'll want to use the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/login/[Login API]. Please consult that documentation for full details.

[source,shell]
.Send the Code Script
----
API_KEY=...
REQUEST_PAYLOAD='{...}'
TWO_FACTOR_ID=... # from the login response

curl -XPOST -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" 'https://local.fusionauth.io/api/two-factor/send?twoFactorId='$TWO_FACTOR_ID -d $REQUEST_PAYLOAD
----

[source,json]
.Send the Code Request JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/two-factor/send/twoFactorId-request.json[]
----

This call will send an email, because that is the `methodId` provided. The email address to which the code is sent may be different than the `loginId` used. The target email address for a MFA login need not be the same as the login Id.

==== Completing the Login

Then you'll need to collect the code. This is a page you'll need to implement. When you have the code, you can complete the two factor login by calling the Login API.

[source,shell]
.Complete the MFA Login Script
----
API_KEY=...
REQUEST_PAYLOAD='{...}'

curl -XPOST -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" 'https://local.fusionauth.io/api/two-factor/login' -d $REQUEST_PAYLOAD
----

[source,json]
.Complete the MFA Login Request JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/login/two-factor/request.json[]
----

You can pass a parameter to this request indicating you want to recieve a `twoFactorTrustId`. That value can then be provided at future logins to bypass the MFA process. Please consult the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/login/[Login API] documentation for more on that.

== Step Up Auth

Step up authentication allows you to be extra certain that a user is who they say they are. You can use this in your application to protect sensitive actions, such as account deletion or sending money. 

To do so, you need to do the following:

* Start the process
* Send the code
* Receive the code and verify it

Let's walk through each of these.


=== Start the Process

You need to kick off the process using the Start endpoint.

[source,shell]
.Start a Step Up MFA Flow
----
API_KEY=...
REQUEST_PAYLOAD='{...}'

curl -XPOST -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" 'https://local.fusionauth.io/api/two-factor/start' -d $REQUEST_PAYLOAD
----

[source,json]
.Start a Step Up MFA Flow Request JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/two-factor/start/request.json[]
----

You can specify a code if you need that managed externally. You can also provide a `state` JSON object which will be stored off and returned to you after this login completes.

This returns a JSON response which includes a code:

[source,json]
.Start an MFA Flow Response JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/two-factor/start/response-with-methods.json[]
----

You'll need to save off the `twoFactorId` as you'll need that later. You'll also want to save the `methods` array as you'll need to present that to the end user.

Next, you can send the code if needed. If you are providing your own code, you do not want to use FusionAuth to send the code as that will set the code to a different value.

=== Sending the Code

This is only required if the user chooses a message based MFA method and you want to send the message with FusionAuth. 

[NOTE]
====
Using this request will reset the one time code to a different value than that provided to the start API call.
====

[source,shell]
.Send the Code Script
----
API_KEY=...
REQUEST_PAYLOAD='{...}'
TWO_FACTOR_ID=... # from the login response

curl -XPOST -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" 'https://local.fusionauth.io/api/two-factor/send?twoFactorId='$TWO_FACTOR_ID -d $REQUEST_PAYLOAD
----

[source,json]
.Send the Code Request JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/two-factor/send/twoFactorId-request.json[]
----

This call will send an email, since that is the specified method. The `methodId` needs to match whatever the user chose. The email address to which the code is sent could be different than the `loginId` used. The target email address for a MFA login need not be the same as the login Id.

Additionally, unlike with the login API, you don't have to send the code using the send API when doing step up auth. You only need to get the code to the user somehow. In fact, the user doesn't even need to have MFA enabled. If you provided the code originally, you could, for example, build your own integration with a chat service like Slack and send the code to the user that way. Any out of band method, even https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1149[carrier pigeon], would work.

=== Completing the Step Up

Then you'll need to collect the code. You'll have to implement this input screen.

When you have the code, you can complete the step up by calling the Login API. This will return back the user object when the provided code is valid or one of the other return codes documented in the Login API when it is not.

[source,shell]
.Complete the MFA Step Up Script
----
API_KEY=...
REQUEST_PAYLOAD='{...}'

curl -XPOST -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" 'https://local.fusionauth.io/api/two-factor/login' -d $REQUEST_PAYLOAD
----

[source,json]
.Complete the MFA Login Request JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/login/two-factor/request.json[]
----

If this call is successful and returns a user object, the user has been successfully authenticated with the additional factor. 

Full speed ahead with the sensitive action!

== Disabling MFA on a User

There may be times when it makes sense to disable MFA on a user. There are a number of ways to do so.

You can remove it from a user using the FusionAuth administrative user interface. Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Users -> The User# and manage the user. Then go to the [breadcrumb]#Multi-Factor# tab. You can remove any of the MFA methods by clicking the red trash can icon and confirming the deletion.

image::guides/multi-factor-authentication/delete-factor-admin-view.png[Delete an MFA method from the admin screen.,width=1200]

A user can also remove their own MFA methods by using the new self service account management to enable MFA for their accounts (if you have a paid edition). link:/docs/v1/tech/account-management/[Learn more about that here.]

image::guides/multi-factor-authentication/user-self-serve-manage-factors.png[Self service management of MFA methods.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Finally, you can also remove MFA using the API. To do so you need to:

* Send the code (optionally)
* Get a code or recovery code
* Disable MFA

Let's cover that next.

=== Disabling MFA via the API

First you need to collect a code from the user. This can be a code provided by one of their existing MFA methods or a recovery code. You can gather their chosen MFA methods from the User object if you need to present them with a choice.

==== Optionally Send a Code

If they are using a message based MFA method, you can send them a code:

[source,shell]
.Send a Code For Disabling MFA Script
----
API_KEY=...
REQUEST_PAYLOAD='{...}'

curl -XPOST -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" 'https://local.fusionauth.io/api/two-factor/send' -d $REQUEST_PAYLOAD
----

[source,json]
.Send a Code For Disabling MFA Request JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/two-factor/send/disable-userId-request.json[]
----

This will send a code using the method specified. If a user is using a TOTP method or a recovery code, you can skip this.

==== Collect the Code and Disable MFA

You'll need to build a page to collect the code.

[source,shell]
.Send a Code For Disabling MFA Script
----
API_KEY=...
USER_ID=...
CODE=...
METHOD_ID=...

curl -XDELETE -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" 'http://localhost:9011/api/user/two-factor/'$USER_ID'?&code='$CODE'&methodId='$METHOD_ID
----

[NOTE]
====
When you use a recovery code to disable MFA, it removes all the MFA methods for a given user and invalidates all the other recovery codes.
====

== Resending Codes

You can resend codes using message based MFA methods by calling the send endpoint repeatedly. This may occur because a user requests it. For example, if a user initially requests to get an MFA to an email address, then realizes they really want to get it sent via SMS to their mobile phone.

Calling the send endpoint sends a new code and invalidates all other codes associated with this MFA request. 

== Recovery Codes

Recovery codes are presented the first time an MFA method is enabled for a user. They are one time use. If presented and valid, the system will proceed as if a valid MFA code was presented and mark the code as used. 

If needed, you may retrieve them using the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/two-factor/#retrieve-recovery-codes[Recovery Code API].

== Migration from Version 1.25 and Earlier

To migrate from the MFA provided in FusionAuth 1.25 or earlier, consider the following:

* Your edition
* Your data
* Your code

=== Your Edition

If you are not paying for FusionAuth, you are using the community edition; you can link:/pricing/editions/[learn more about the various editions]. Due to the complexity of the rewrite, SMS based MFA is no longer part of the community edition.

Therefore if you want to use message based MFA or the link:/docs/v1/tech/account-management/[self service account management], you'll need to purchase a paid license. 

Google Authenticator/time based one-time password MFA will continue to work in the community edition. It is even improved. You can now add multiple authenticator devices to one user account.

=== Your Data

If you used MFA previously, your data should be migrated transparently to the new data formats when you run the SQL upgrade migration. 

This includes:

* whether or not each user has MFA enabled
* migrating existing Twilio settings to the new messenger configuration objects
* TOTP configuration

If you find data that has not migrated, https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-issues/issues[please file an issue] and let us know.

=== Your Code

Modifying your code depends on what MFA methods you were doing.

To enable MFA on a user:

* Ensure the MFA method is allowed on the tenant.
* Ensure any messengers are set up correctly.
* Instead of using the [field]#delivery# field, use the [field]#method# field and the corresponding method specific field such as [field]#email#.

To disable MFA on a user:

* In addition to passing the [field]#userId# and [field]#code# fields, you also need to determine the method to disable and pass the appropriate [field]#methodId# field.

When sending a code, Twilio SMS was previously your only choice. Sending codes are now differentiated based on what you are trying to do. Sending a code to enable or disable MFA on a user requires different parameters than sending a code for step up authnetication.

To migrate this functionality:

* Ensure the MFA method is allowed on the tenant.
* Ensure any messengers are set up correctly.
* Call the send endpoint with the correct [field]#method# field and the corresponding method specific field such as [field]#email#.

== Integrating Other MFA Methods

If you have other MFA methods that you'd like to integrate, you have a couple of options.

* link:https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/roadmap/[Check out the roadmap] to see if the method is going to be added soon. If not, https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-issues/issues[file an issue] explaining your use case.
* If you can send a code out of band and compare the value, you can use step up auth to protect all the pages in your system. As soon as a user logs in, require step up auth and a code sent out of band. Users don't have to have MFA enabled to use step up.
* If you want an additional factor that can be made available as a service and receive a webhook, you can configure your webhooks to be transactional and have a webhook sent on the login event. The service can then perform the MFA check, perhaps doing something like fingerprint recognition. If any status other than `200` is returned, the login will fail. The downside of this is that the message to the end user won't be helpful. Here is an link:/blog/2020/08/13/locking-an-account-with-breached-password/[example of a webhook stopping a login].
