Users with supported multi-factor methods can be migrated.
By using the link:/docs/v1/apis/users[Users API] and the updating the [field]#twoFactor# attributes of each user, you can migrate any of the supported MFA methods.
You can use this with a bulk import or a slow migration.

"twoFactor": {
  "methods": [{
    "method": "email",
    "email": "dinesh@aol.com"
  }, 
  {
    "method": "email",
    "email": "dinesh@gmail.com"
  }]
}

If your MFA method is not supported, but is message based (such as push notifications) please evalute the link:/docs/v1/tech/messengers/generic-messenger[Generic Messenger] to see if it fits your needs.
You might be able to use the SMS method with a generic messenger.

Otherwise, please open a http://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-issues/issues[GitHub issue] detailing your use case.
