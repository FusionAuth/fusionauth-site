== Overview

You can search users in FusionAuth to see how many there are, what they are doing, and more. This document will walk you through how to use FusionAuth's powerful search capabilities to retrieve such user data.

Most of this document applies to searching link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/entity-management[Entities], which also leverage the Elasticsearch engine.

Examples are in curl, but you may also use any of the link:/docs/v1/tech/client-libraries/[supported client libraries] to run user searches in your favorite development language.

== What Type of Engine

This document discusses the Elasticsearch search engine.

You can determine which search engine FusionAuth is using. It will either be the `database` search engine or the `elasticsearch` search engine.

To do so, in the administrative user interface, navigate to [breadcrumb]#System -> About# and scroll to the [breadcrumb]#System# section and you will see the configured search engine, as well as the version of Elasticsearch, if available. Below, it is `Elasticsearch 7.17.0`.

If you are using the database search engine, you'll want to link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/users#database-search-engine[consult the database search engine documentation] for more information. 

* Learn more about link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/search[each type of search engine].
* Learn more about link:/docs/v1/tech/tutorials/switch-search-engines[switching search engines].

== An Introduction To The Elasticsearch Search Engine

With any search, you can make either a `POST` or a `GET` request. The functionality is exactly the same, but a `POST` request can be larger. On the other hand, a `GET` request is easily shared. Pick what works for you. However, this document uses `POST` requests.

=== Three Types of Searches

There are three parameters for a search, and they are mutually exclusive.

.Search Type Summary
[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
| Parameter | Uses Elasticsearch | Best For 

| `ids`
| No
| When you know the exact Ids of users you are trying to retrieve. You may have stored the id off in some other datastore, or be responding to a webhook.

| `queryString`
| Yes
| When you are searching on one field or want to search across multiple fields for strings. 

| `query`
| Yes
| Useful to leverage the full power of Elasticsearch queries and need to look across different fields, including nested values, and/or use compound or complex search parameters such as ranges.

|===


==== Ids Searches

`ids` searches are useful when you know exactly which users you want to retrieve. This is the only search which is guaranteed to only query the database, never Elasticsearch.

==== QueryString Searches

The `queryString` search is a case-insensitive match. Whitespace is allowed in the search, but must be URL escaped; for example, using `%20` for a space character. Elasticsearch compatible regular expressions may be used, so you may search by prefix or suffix using the `*` wildcard. You may also search particular fields by prefixing the query with a field name, such as `email:`.

If the `queryString` parameter has a `:` it will be passed as-is. Otherwise, if it has no spaces and contains a `@` it is assumed to be an email address and will be passed with a prefix: `email:`. Otherwise, if it has no spaces it will have the wildcard `*` prepended and appended.

You may use `AND` and `OR` clauses in this parameter to construct compound queries.

==== Query Searches

The `query` parameter search requires an escaped JSON string which is passed to Elasticsearch and therefore must be a valid Elasticsearch query. With a `query` search, you have the full power of the Elasticsearch query language.

=== Field Mappings

For both `queryString` and `query` searches, you may search against specific fields.

The exact list of indexed fields is not documented, but if you are running FusionAuth self-hosted, you can find the list by https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/indices-get-mapping.html[retrieving the Elasticsearch mapping].

If you are using FusionAuth Cloud, please https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support[open a support ticket] if you have a question about which fields are searchable.

Fields of the user object are indexed, as are the following relationships, which are available using the `nested` query type.

* `memberships` - group memberships for this user
* `registrations` - application registrations for this user

Learn more about https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/query-dsl-nested-query.html[the nested query type].

== Results Of a User Search

The results of any search have the same format. There is a `total` object with the number of results and a `users` array containing user objects.

== User Search Examples

Below are examples of searches you can run. All examples are available to be run locally by downloading https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-example-user-search[this GitHub repository] and following the instructions in the README.

Each example uses the below shell script to run the search. Feel free to download it, update your API key and base FusionAuth URL, and experiment. The script uses the `POST` method so that the request body can be large. The value of the filename passed to the script changes each time, but everything else is the same. 

[source,bash] 
.`search.sh`: An Example Shell Script For Searching
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-user-search/main/examples/search.sh[]
----

== Searching By User Ids

Here's an example of an `ids` query.

[source,json]
.Example Request JSON Searching By [field]#ids#
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-user-search/main/examples/ids/ids-request.json[]
----

This file is the first argument for the `search.sh` shell script. Here's how you'd run the query if the above JSON is in the `ids-request.json` file.

[source,shell] 
.Running The Example Shell Script
----
./search.sh ids-request.json
----

== Searching With `queryString`

Let's look at some examples of `queryString` searches. Below, you are searching for `dinesh`, across all fields, and wildcards are prepended and appended.

[source,json]
.Example Request JSON For Searching Across All Indexed Fields With [field]#queryString# 
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-user-search/main/examples/queryString/all-fields-data-request.json[]
----

Here's how you'd run it if the above JSON is in `all-fields-data-request.json`.

[source,shell] 
.Running The Example Shell Script
----
./search.sh all-fields-data-request.json
----

Below, only the `email` field is searched for the string `dinesh`, because `email:` is specified.

[source,json]
.Example Request JSON For Searching By Emails With [field]#queryString# 
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-user-search/main/examples/queryString/email-data-request.json[]
----

If you change the value from `email:dinesh*` to `email:dinesh` this query will return 0 results, because there is no user with that email and no wildcarding is done. If, instead, you change the value to `email:dinesh@fusionauth.io` this query will return the user.

Finally, below, the `email` field matches the string `dinesh` and the `verified` field is `false`. These are joined together with an `OR` clause which returns the user if either clause is true, but you can also use `AND` for the intersection.

[source,json]
.Example Request JSON For Searching By Emails And The Verified Field
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-user-search/main/examples/queryString/email-verified-data-request.json[]
----

== Searching With `query`

The `query` parameter is the most powerful way to search. The `query` parameter is an escaped Elasticsearch query which is passed through to the corresponding Elasticsearch server. Let's walk through some examples.

=== Searching On One Field

First, build the Elasticsearch query. Below is a query matching all users with a `user.data.Company` attribute of `PiedPiper`. 

[NOTE.note]
====
The FusionAuth `user.data` field can hold arbitrary JSON and is useful if your users have customer data fields.

There is a similar `.data` field on many FusionAuth objects, though not all of them are indexed and searchable.
====

The key is case sensitive, so searching on `user.data.company` will return zero results. However, the value is case insensitive. Searching for values of `PiedPiper`, `piedpiper` and `PIEDPIPER` will return the same number of results.

[source,json]
.Example Elasticsearch Query JSON Searching the Company User Attribute
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-user-search/main/examples/query/user-data-simple.json[]
----

Next, escape any JSON characters in the string. This is a major difference when using the `query` method when compared to the `queryString` method. Because you can use the full Elasticsearch query language with the `query` method, but FusionAuth's APIs also expect JSON, you must escape the Elasticsearch query JSON.

One option to escape the JSON is to use https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[`jq`]. If the Elasticsearch query above is in `queryfile`, escape it using the below command. (You may ignore or remove the newlines indicated by `\n`; they'll be ignored by Elasticsearch.)

[source,shell]
.Escaping Elasticsearch Query String using jq
----
cat queryfile | jq -R -s '.' 
----

That command outputs this string.

[source,json]
.Example Escaped Elasticsearch Query JSON For Searching the Company User Attribute
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-user-search/main/examples/query/user-data-simple-escaped.json[]
----

Next, add that string as the `query` parameter to a request.

[source,json]
.Example Request JSON For Searching By the Company User Attribute Emails With [field]#queryString# 
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-user-search/main/examples/query/user-data-simple-request.json[]
----

Then, run the query using the `search.sh` script. Here's how you'd run it if the above JSON is in `user-data-simple-request.json`.

[source,shell] 
.Running The Example Shell Script
----
./search.sh user-data-simple-request.json
----

=== Searching On Multiple Fields

You can also perform advanced searches, including with multiple clauses, nested queries and numeric ranges. Let's take a closer look at a more complex query.

First, here's the query.

[source,json]
.Example Elasticsearch Complex Query JSON
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-user-search/main/examples/query/user-data-complex.json[]
----

With this query, you are searching for users who meet the following criteria.

* A salary of less than 100000.
* Pied Piper employment.
* A verified email address.
* Registered for a particular application in your system. The `registrations` object is nested.
* For that particular application, having a `paid` attribute of `false`.

This is quite specific. In addition to matching a value in the `user.data` field like the first example, you are searching ranges, checking standard user attributes such as `verified`, finding users who have registered for a given application, and examining application specific fields.

[NOTE.note]
====
With the `query` search method, if you can write the Elasticsearch query, you can find your users.
====

After creating the query, escape JSON characters in the query string. You can use `jq` to do the escaping. If the Elasticsearch query above is in `queryfile`, you can escape it using this command.

[source,shell]
.Escaping Elasticsearch Query String using jq
----
cat queryfile | jq -R -s '.' 
----

That will display this escaped string:

[source,json]
.Example Escaped Elasticsearch Complex Query JSON 
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-user-search/main/examples/query/user-data-complex-escaped.json[]
----

The next step is to add that string as the `query` parameter to a request.

[source,json]
.Example Request JSON For a Complex Query 
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-user-search/main/examples/query/user-data-complex-request.json[]
----

Run the query using the `search.sh` script. Here's how you'd run it if the above JSON is in `user-data-complex-request.json`.

[source,shell] 
.Running The Example Shell Script
----
./search.sh user-data-complex-request.json
----

You'll get back any users that match all the criteria.

== Pagination

include::docs/v1/tech/shared/_paginating-search-results.adoc[]

Note that you'll only be able to get back 10000 results no matter how you paginate. See the <<Limitations>> section for workarounds.

== Re-indexing

include::docs/v1/tech/shared/_re-indexing-elasticsearch.adoc[]

== Supported Elasticsearch Versions

include::docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/_elasticsearch-version.adoc[]

== Elasticsearch And OpenSearch

Currently, only Elasticsearch is officially supported.

Users and community members have reported some success with https://opensearch.org/[OpenSearch], the fork of Elasticsearch, but it is not currently supported.

Please see https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1558[this GitHub issue] for more details.
