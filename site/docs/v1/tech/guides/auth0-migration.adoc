== Overview

This document will help you migrate off of Auth0. If you are looking to compare FusionAuth and Auth0, link:/blog/2018/10/19/auth0-and-fusionauth-a-tale-of-two-solutions/[this document may help]. 

This guide assumes you have installed FusionAuth. If you have not, please link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/[view our installation guides] and install FusionAuth before you begin. For more general migration information, please view the link:/docs/v1/tech/guides/migration/[FusionAuth migration guide].

There are a number of different ways applications can be integrated with Auth0, and it would be difficult to cover them all. This guide mentions the typical parts of a migration and in particular focuses on migrating user data from an Auth0 managed user database into FusionAuth. 

== Planning Considerations

=== Obtaining User Data

You can use either the Auth0 management API or the Auth0 user interface to export user data. This guide uses the user interface, but if you have a large number of users, the https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Users/get_users[management API is recommended]. Auth0 also has a https://auth0.com/docs/support/export-data[high level export guide] worth reviewing.

If you are using the user interface, usernames, email addresses and other data can be obtained by installing an extension and downloading the data. The password hashes can be obtained by opening a support ticket.

Here's a brief video walking through the export process, which is further documented below.

video::wQklLZZP_3s[youtube,width=560,height=315]

=== Mapping User Attributes

The attributes of the User object in FusionAuth are link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/users/[well documented]. 

If there is an attribute in your Auth0 user which cannot be directly mapped to a FusionAuth attribute, you can place it to the `user.data` field. This field can store arbitrary JSON values and will be indexed and searchable.

=== Other Entities

There are other important entities, such as connections or roles, that typically need to be migrated. There are usually fewer of these, so an automated migration may not make sense, but plan to move this configuration somehow.

Be aware that the functionality of permissions, roles and connections may not be the same between Auth0 and FusionAuth. This is different from user data; as long as you can migrate a login (a username or email) and a password hash, a user will be authenticated and successfully migrated. You can link:/download/[download FusionAuth] before you begin a migration and build a proof of concept to learn more about the differences. A partial list what may need to be migrated for your application to work properly includes the following:

* In Auth0, https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders[Connections] are a source of data for users. FusionAuth calls these link:/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers/[Identity Providers].
* https://auth0.com/docs/rules[Rules], https://auth0.com/docs/hooks[Hooks] and https://auth0.com/docs/actions[Actions] are ways for you to customize authentication or authorization workflows. FusionAuth has a similar concept called link:/docs/v1/tech/lambdas/[Lambdas].
* With Auth0, https://auth0.com/docs/applications/set-up-an-application[APIs, Applications and SSO Integrations] are what your users can log in to. They are also called Clients in the Auth0 documentation. FusionAuth refers to these as link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/applications/[Applications]. 
* https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/learn-the-basics[Tenants] are a high level construct which groups other entities such as users and applications together. FusionAuth calls these link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/tenants/[Tenants] as well. FusionAuth supports multi-tenant configuration by default.
* For Auth0, https://auth0.com/docs/authorization/rbac/roles[Roles and Permissions] provide information about what your users can do in your custom or off the shelf applications. FusionAuth has link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/roles/[Roles] and they are defined on an Application by Application basis.
* Refresh tokens allow JWTs to be refreshed without a user logging in. These can be migrated using the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/users/#import-refresh-tokens[Import Refresh Tokens API].

[NOTE]
====
In FusionAuth, users are explicitly mapped to applications with a link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/registrations/[Registration]. 

Auth0, in contrast, gives users access to all Auth0 applications in a tenant by default. 
====

==== Identifiers 

When creating an entity, such as an application, with the FusionAuth API, you can specify the Id. This works for users, applications, and tenants, among others.

If you have external dependencies on an Id stored in Auth0, you can port it over to FusionAuth.

=== Universal Login

Auth0 provides https://auth0.com/docs/universal-login[Universal Login]. This is a complex, configurable login component that works with SPAs, native applications and web applications. 

FusionAuth's login experience is less complicated. You can choose to build your own login pages or use FusionAuth's hosted login pages. link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/integration-points/#login-options[Read more about these choices].

Once you've planned your migration, the next step is to export your user data from Auth0.

== Exporting Users

To export users with the user interface, log in and navigate to your dashboard. You'll perform the following steps:

1. Add the User Import/Export extension, if not present
2. Run the extension
3. Download the exported file

=== Add the Extension

Auth0 provides an extension that allows you to both import and export users to and from Auth0. Add the extension by navigating to [breadcrumb]#Extensions# and searching for it.

image::guides/auth0-migration/find-user-export-extension.png[Finding the import/export extension.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

After you find the extension, install it:

image::guides/auth0-migration/user-export-extension-install.png[Installing the import/export extension.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

The next step is to run the extension. 

=== Run the Extension

Next, run the extension. The first time you run it, you'll be asked to grant needed permissions. Then, choose the export tab. 

This will bring up a screen with information such as what fields you want to export, which connections to pull users from, and the export file format.

image::guides/auth0-migration/user-export-extension-export-run.png[Running the import/export extension.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

For this guide, export user information as JSON. Choose the default user database. Finally, if you have special fields to include, configure their export as needed. Then begin the export.

image::guides/auth0-migration/auth0-export-complete.png[View when the the import/export extension is finished.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Depending on how many users you have in your database, it may take a while for this to complete.

=== Download the File

After the export finishes, download the file provided. At the end of the process, you'll end up with a JSON file like this:

[source,json,title=Sample Auth0 user data export download]
----
{"user_id":"auth0|60425da93519d90068f82966","email":"test@example.com","name":"test@example.com","nickname":"test","created_at":"2021-03-05T16:34:49.518Z","updated_at":"2021-03-05T16:34:49.518Z","email_verified":false}
{"user_id":"auth0|60425dc43519d90068f82973","email":"test2@example.com","name":"test2@example.com","nickname":"test2","created_at":"2021-03-05T16:35:16.786Z","updated_at":"2021-03-05T16:35:16.786Z","email_verified":false}
----

This is half of the data you'll need to migrate your users. The other half is the password hashes. 

== Exporting Password Hashes

Because password hashes are considered sensitive information, Auth0 does not export them as part of the general export process. You must file a support ticket to get the hashes and other password related information.

[NOTE]
====
During this migration, passwords are never exposed in plaintext. Neither FusionAuth, Auth0, nor you ever have access to the password.
====

However, once you've exported the password hashes from Auth0 and imported them into FusionAuth, your users will be able to log in to FusionAuth with the same password they used previously. 

If you are not able to export the hashes, due to the plan you are on or the migration timelines, one alternative is to have every user change their password using the forgot password flow. You can still import all the user data.

To start the process of obtaining the hashes, open a support ticket. From your dashboard, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Get Support#, and then open a ticket by scrolling to the bottom of the support page. 

image::guides/auth0-migration/create-ticket-start.png[The first step to getting your password hashes.,width=1200,role=top-cropped]

Select the issue and details of your request. Choose `I have a question regarding my Auth0 account` and then pick the `I would like to obtain an export of my password hashes` option.

You'll receive an automated message after this ticket is submitted. View progress on the ticket screen. 

[NOTE]
====
Auth0 requires you to be on a link:https://auth0.com/docs/support/export-data[paid plan] to export your password hashes. You cannot export them otherwise.

Additionally, Auth0 makes no commitments about the processing time for a password hash request. In the author's experience, it took approximately one week.

Plan accordingly. 
====

After your request is processed, you'll download a JSON file containing password hashes, related information and user ids. It will look like this:

[source,json,title=Sample Auth0 password hash export download]
----
{"_id":{"$oid":"60425dc43519d90068f82973"},"email_verified":false,"email":"test2@example.com","passwordHash":"$2b$10$Z6hUTEEeoJXN5/AmSm/4.eZ75RYgFVriQM9LPhNEC7kbAbS/VAaJ2","password_set_date":{"$date":"2021-03-05T16:35:16.775Z"},"tenant":"dev-rwsbs6ym","connection":"Username-Password-Authentication","_tmp_is_unique":true}
{"_id":{"$oid":"60425da93519d90068f82966"},"email_verified":false,"email":"test@example.com","passwordHash":"$2b$10$CSZ2JarG4XYbGa.JkfpqnO2wrlbfp5eb5LScHSGo9XGeZ.a.Ic54S","password_set_date":{"$date":"2021-03-05T16:34:49.502Z"},"tenant":"dev-rwsbs6ym","connection":"Username-Password-Authentication","_tmp_is_unique":true}
----

Now that you have both the user data and the password hashes, you can import your users.

== Importing Users

There are a few steps to take to import users. 

* Prepare your FusionAuth installation
* Get the import script 
* Install needed gems
* Customize the script
* Run the script
* Test

=== Set up FusionAuth

You need to set up FusionAuth so migrated user data can be stored. As mentioned above, this guide assumes you have FusionAuth installed. If you don't, link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/[view our installation guides] and get it installed before proceeding further.

==== Create a Test Tenant

It is best to create a separate tenant for a migration testing. Tenants logically isolate configuration settings and users. If a migration goes awry or you need to redo it after tweaking the script, you can delete the test tenant and start with a clean system. To add a tenant, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Tenants# and choose the green plus sign.

image::guides/auth0-migration/list-of-tenants-add-highlighted.png[Adding a tenant.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Give it a descriptive name like `Auth0 import test` and save it. You shouldn't need to modify any of the other configuration options to test importing users. Save the tenant.

image::guides/auth0-migration/add-tenant.png[The tenant creation screen.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Record the Id of the tenant, which will be something like `25c9d123-8a79-4edd-9f76-8dd9c806b0f3`. You'll use this in the import script.

image::guides/auth0-migration/list-of-tenants.png[The tenant list.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

==== Create a Test Application

Applications are anything that a user can log in to. In FusionAuth there's no differentiation between web applications, SaaS applications, APIs and native apps. To add an application, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Applications# and choose the green plus sign. Give the application a descriptive name like `Auth0 application`.

Navigate to the [breadcrumb]#OAuth# tab and add an entry to [field]#Authorized redirect URLs#. Use a testing value such as `\https://fusionauth.io`. Later, you'll need to update this to be a valid redirect URL to code which can take the authorization code and exchange it for a token. Learn more about this in the link:/docs/v1/tech/oauth/[FusionAuth OAuth documentation].

You shouldn't need to modify any of the other configuration options to test importing users. Save the application. 

image::guides/auth0-migration/add-application.png[The application creation screen.,width=1200]

Next, view the application by clicking the green magnifying glass and note the [field]#OAuth IdP login URL#. You'll be using it to test that users can log in.

image::guides/auth0-migration/find-login-url.png[Finding the login URL.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

==== Add an API Key

The next step is to create an API key. This will be used by the import script. To do so, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> API Keys# in the administrative user interface.

image::guides/auth0-migration/add-api-key.png[Adding an API key,width=1200]

This key needs to have the permission to run a bulk import of users. In the spirit of the principle of least privilege, give it the permission to `POST` to the `/api/user/import` endpoint. Record the API key string, as you'll use it below.

image::guides/auth0-migration/set-api-key-permissions.png[Setting API key permissions,width=1200]

=== Get the Script

FusionAuth provides an import script under a permissive open source license. It requires ruby (tested with ruby 2.7). To get the script, clone the git repository:

[source,shell,title=Getting the import scripts]
----
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-import-scripts
----

Navigate to the `auth0` directory:

[source,shell,title=Navigate to the correct directory]
----
cd fusionauth-import-scripts/auth0
----

=== Install Needed Gems

The following gems must be available to the import script:

* `date`
* `json`
* `fusionauth_client`

If you have bundler installed, run `bundle install` in the `auth0` directory. Otherwise install the needed gems in some other way.

=== Configure the Script

Next, you need to modify some configuration in the script. Edit the `import.rb` file. Update important variables as shown below:

[source,ruby,title=An excerpt of the import.rb script]
----
# ...
# BEGIN Modify these variables for your Import
users_file = 'users.json'
secrets_file = 'secrets.json'

$fusionauth_url = 'http://localhost:9011'
$fusionauth_api_key = 'bf69486b-4733-4470-a592-f1bfce7af580'

# Optionally specify the target tenant. If only one tenant exists this is optional and the users
# will be imported to the default tenant. When more than one tenant exists in FusionAuth this is required.
$fusionauth_tenant_id = '16970284-4680-4b3c-8a7e-424644ed1090'

# Map Auth0 userId to the FusionAuth User Id as a UUID
$map_auth0_user_id = false

# END Modify these variables for your Import
# ...
----

For this script to work correctly, update the following values:

* `users_file` should point to the location of the user export file you obtained.
* `secrets_file` needs to point to the location of the password hash export file you received.
* `$fusionauth_url` must point to your FusionAuth instance. If you are testing locally, it will probably be `'http://localhost:9011'`.
* `$fusionauth_api_key` needs to be set to the value of the API key created above.
* `$fusionauth_tenant_id` should be set to the Id of the testing tenant created above.

You may or may not want to change `$map_auth0_user_id`. If you have external systems reliant on the Auth0 user identifier, set this to `true`. Doing so ensures imported users have the same Id as they did in Auth0. Otherwise, you can leave this variable set to `false`.

==== Enhancing the Script

You may also want to migrate additional data. Currently, the following attributes are migrated:

* `user_id`
* `email`
* `email_verified`
* `username`
* `insertInstant`
* the password hash and supporting attributes

The migrated user will have the Auth0 tenant Id and original user Id stored on the `user.data` object. If you have additional user attributes to migrate, review and modify the `map_user` method. 

You may also want to create Registrations, assign Roles, or associate users with Group, by creating the appropriate JSON data structures in the import call. These are documented in the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/users/#import-users[Import User API docs]. This will require modifying the `import.rb` code.

For example, to register all users to an Application with an Id of `6b72ba2d-679a-41dd-adb3-9f3e75e7cd1f`, add the following code to `map_user` before the `user` object is returned:

[source,ruby,title=Adding an application registration to every user]
----
# ...
user['registrations'] = []
application_registration = {
  applicationId: '6b72ba2d-679a-41dd-adb3-9f3e75e7cd1f'
}
user['registrations'].push(application_registration)
# ...
return user
----

=== Run the Script

You can now run the import script:

[source,shell,title=Running the import script]
----
ruby ./import.rb
----

You'll see output like:

[source,shell,title=Import script output]
----
$ ruby ./import.rb 
FusionAuth Importer : Auth0
 > User file: users.json
 > User secrets file: secrets.json
 > Call FusionAuth to import users
 > Import success
Duplicate users 0
Import complete. 2 users imported.
----

=== Verify the Import

Next, log in to the FusionAuth administrative user interface. Review the user entries to ensure the data was correctly imported.

image::guides/auth0-migration/list-users.png[List imported users.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

If you have a test user whose password you know, open an incognito window and log in to ensure the hash migration was successful. You recorded the URL to log in to the example application in <<Create a Test Application>>.

image::guides/auth0-migration/user-login.png[The user login screen.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

After the test login, the user will be redirected to a URL like `\https://fusionauth.io/?code=FlZF97WIYLNxt4SGD_22qvpRh4fZ6kg_N89ZbBAy1E4&locale=fr&userState=Authenticated`. This happens because you haven't set up a web application to handle the authorization code redirect. That is an important next step but is beyond the scope of this document. Consult the link:/docs/v1/tech/5-minute-setup-guide/[5 minute setup guide] for an example of how to do this.

=== The Final Destination of Imported Users

After you are done testing, you can choose to import users into the default tenant or a new tenant. Whichever you choose, make sure to update `$fusionauth_tenant_id` to the correct value before running the import for the final time.

If you aren't keeping the users in the test tenant, delete it.

=== Deleting the Test Tenant

If you need to start over because the import failed or you need to tweak a setting, delete the tenant you created. This will remove all the users and other configuration for this tenant, giving you a fresh start. To do so, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Tenants# and choose the red trash can icon. 

image::guides/auth0-migration/list-of-tenants-delete-highlighted.png[Deleting a a tenant.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Confirm your desire to delete the tenant. Depending on how many users you have imported, this may take some time.

== What to Do Next

At a minimum, assign your users to the appropriate migrated FusionAuth applications. You can do this in two ways:

* As part of your import script by modifying the script and adding link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/users/#import-users[Registration JSON information] to the `map_user` method, as illustrated in <<Enhancing the Script>>.
* After users have been migrated with the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/registrations[Registrations API]. 

You'll also need to modify and test your applications to ensure:

* Users can log in.
* The authorization code redirect is handled correctly.
* Users receive appropriate permissions and roles.

If your application uses a standard OAuth, SAML or OIDC library to communicate with Auth0, the transition should be relatively painless.

== Additional Support

If you need support in your migration beyond that provided in this guide, you may:

* Post in our link:/community/forums/[community forums] 
* link:/pricing/editions/[Purchase a support contract]
