== Upgrading

In order to upgrade FusionAuth to a later version use the following guides. Below you will find steps to follow if you are using `.deb` or `.rpm` package on Linux, or a `.zip` package on macOS, Linux or Windows.

Topics covered in this document:

* <<ZIP Packages>>
* <<Linux Packages>>
** <<Troubleshooting Upgrade with RPMs>>
* <<FastPath>>
* <<Database>>
* <<Themes>>
* <<Downtime>>

If you used the FastPath or other installation methods initially, you may prefer to use that same mode to download the latest version of FusionAuth. If you would like to continue by manually downloading the necessary packages, read on.

[NOTE]
====
*Readme*

To upgrade to the latest version of FusionAuth using the FastPath installation go link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/fast-path[here].

== ZIP Packages

FusionAuth is available in a zip package for macOS, Linux and Windows. If you are using the ZIP package, please use this guide to update an existing instance of FusionAuth.

=== macOS and Linux

In this example, we'll assume you have previously installed FusionAuth in `/usr/local/fusionauth` and this directory will be referred to `FUSIONAUTH_HOME`. If you have used a different directory you can adjust the following example accordingly.

[source,title=Example filesystem layout]
----
/usr/local/fusionauth/bin
/usr/local/fusionauth/config
/usr/local/fusionauth/config/keystore
/usr/local/fusionauth/config/fusionauth.properties
/usr/local/fusionauth/data
/usr/local/fusionauth/fusionauth-app
/usr/local/fusionauth/fusionauth-search
/usr/local/fusionauth/java
----

The first step will be to shutdown the FusionAuth services.

[source,title=Shutdown and Uninstall FusionAuth]
----
# Stop Services
/usr/local/fusionauth/bin/shutdown.sh

# Delete or move existing installation
cd /usr/local/fusionauth
rm -rf ./fusionauth-app
rm -rf ./fusionauth-search
rm -rf ./bin
----

During an upgrade, most everything is saved in the database, so it is safe to delete these directories. To preserve your configuration and Elasticsearch index you want to be sure to preserve the following directories:

[source,title=Preserve these directories]
----
/usr/local/fusionauth/config
/usr/local/fusionauth/data
/usr/local/fusionauth/java
/usr/local/fusionauth/logs
----

Extract the new zips and place in `FUSIONAUTH_HOME`. In the following example, we are using the `unzip` command with the `-n` and the `-q` flags. The `-q` flag is optional, it causes the command to be run in quiet mode to reduce the amount of output to the console. The other flag `-n` is a no overwrite flag so that any configuration files are not overwritten.

[source,title=Unzip the new packages with a no overwrite flag]
----
unzip -nq new-fusionauth-app.zip
unzip -nq new-fusionauth-search.zip
----

Finally restart the FusionAuth services.

[source,title=Startup FusionAuth]
----
# Start Services
/usr/local/fusionauth/bin/startup.sh
----

=== Windows

In this example, we'll assume you have previously installed FusionAuth in `\fusionauth` and this directory will be referred to `FUSIONAUTH_HOME`. If you have used a different directory you can adjust the following example accordingly.

[source,title=Example filesystem layout]
----
\fusionauth\bin
\fusionauth\config
\fusionauth\config\keystore
\fusionauth\config\fusionauth.properties
\fusionauth\data
\fusionauth\fusionauth-app
\fusionauth\fusionauth-search
\fusionauth\java
----

The first step will be to shutdown the FusionAuth services and delete the old installation.

[source,title=Shutdown and Uninstall FusionAuth]
----
# Stop Services
net stop FusionAuthApp
net stop FusionAuthSearch

# Uninstall Services
cd \fusionauth\fusionauth-app\bin
FusionAuthApp.exe /uninstall
cd \fusionauth\fusionauth-search\elasticsearch\bin
FusionAuthSearch.exe /uninstall

# Delete or move existing installation
cd \fusionauth
move fusionauth-app fusionauth-app-old
move fusionauth-search fusionauth-search-old
----

[NOTE]
====
Prior to version `1.37.0` the executable will be found in the `apache-tomcat` directory. For example,

`\fusionauth\fusionauth-app\apache-tomcat\bin\FusionAuthApp.exe`

Versions 1.37.0 through 1.39.0 do not support native Windows installation.
====

During an upgrade, most everything is saved in the database, so it is safe to delete these directories. To preserve your configuration and Elasticsearch index you want to be sure to preserve the following directories:

[source,title=Preserve these directories]
----
\fusionauth\config
\fusionauth\data
\fusionauth\java
\fusionauth\logs
----

Extract the new zips and place in `FUSIONAUTH_HOME`. You may do this using Windows File Explorer or other command line tools to unpack the zip archive. In this next step, ensure you delete or move the existing directories to ensure you do not unzip the new version on top of the existing version. If you do this, you will end up with duplicate libraries in the classpath that will lead to runtime errors.

After you have extracted the new packages, re-install the Windows services and start them.

[source,title=Install and Start FusionAuth]
----
# Install Windows Services
cd \fusionauth\fusionauth-app\bin
FusionAuthApp.exe /install
cd \fusionauth\fusionauth-search\elasticsearch\bin
FusionAuthSearch.exe /install

# Startup Services
net start FusionAuthSearch
net start FusionAuthApp
----

[NOTE]
====
Prior to version 1.37.0 you can find `FusionAuthApp.exe` at

`\fusionauth\fusionauth-app\apache-tomcat\bin\FusionAuthApp.exe`

Versions 1.37.0 through 1.39.0 do not support native Windows installation.
====

That is it, you're done!

== Linux Packages

Updating your application is easy if you installed using the RPM or Debian packages. All you need to do is to issue an update command to the dpkg or rpm program and specify the new package file. Here is an example:

[NOTE]
====
Running the update script will shut down the FusionAuth service if they have not yet been stopped The service will need to be restarted after the update is finished.
====

[source,title=Shutdown FusionAuth]
----
sudo service fusionauth-app stop
sudo service fusionauth-search stop
----

[source,shell,title=Upgrade FusionAuth using Debian bundles]
----
sudo dpkg -i fusionauth-search-<version>.deb
sudo dpkg -i fusionauth-app-<version>.deb
----

[source,shell,title=Upgrade FusionAuth using RPM bundles]
----
sudo rpm -U fusionauth-search-<version>.rpm
sudo rpm -U fusionauth-app-<version>.rpm
----

[source,title=Start FusionAuth]
----
sudo systemctl start fusionauth-search
sudo systemctl start fusionauth-app
----

=== Troubleshooting Upgrade with RPMs

include::docs/v1/tech/shared/_troubleshooting-uninstall-upgrade-reinstall-rpm.adoc[]

=== FastPath

While FastPath is an option to perform an upgrade, the FastPath process limits the flexibility of installation in order to get up and running quickly. Therefore it is not recommended to use FastPath install scripts in a Production Environment.

When in a production environment please utilize `.deb` or `.rpm` packages when on Linux. If you your production platform is macOS or Windows, please manually manage the upgrade using the `.zip` bundles.

== Database

[NOTE]
====
If you want FusionAuth to upgrade the database automatically, use the link:/docs/v1/tech/guides/silent-mode[Silent Mode] process, which will perform an automated upgrade.

If you want to use Maintenance Mode, ensure your runtime mode is set to `development` and silent mode is set to `false`.

If you want to upgrade the database manually, follow the instructions below.

For more on runtime modes, see the link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/fusionauth-app#runtime-modes[FusionAuth Installation Guide] for reference.

For more information on the various configuration options, see the link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/configuration[Configuration Reference].
====

[NOTE]
====
You should always backup your database prior to using Maintenance Mode.
====

Depending on your current version and the new version you will be updating to you might need to execute one or more SQL scripts to update your
 database. These scripts are located in the migrations folder inside the Database Schema ZIP file. This file can be downloaded by finding the database zip on the https://fusionauth.io/direct-download[Direct Downloads] page.

[WARNING]
====
When upgrading your database from a previous version, be sure to only run the scripts located in the `migrations` folder, the base files
 `mysql.sql` and `postgresql.sql` should only be used during a clean installation when no database schema is present.
====

Inside of the database schema zip file, you will find the FusionAuth migrations. Run them in order, starting with the first migration greater than the version you are coming from, and ending with the version that is less than or equal to the target upgrade version.

For example, if upgrading from version `1.19.1` to `1.22.0`, run the following SQL migrations in this order:

* `1.20.0.sql`
* `1.21.0.sql`
* `1.22.0.sql`
