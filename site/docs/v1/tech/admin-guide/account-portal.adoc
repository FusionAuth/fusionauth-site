== Overview

The account portal is where you can manage your account data, deployments and licenses.
The portal is distinct from your FusionAuth instance, which is where your user data lives.
While an instance can be self-hosted or hosted in FusionAuth cloud, the account portal is an internet accessible web application.

[NOTE.note]
====
You can self-host FusionAuth Community Edition for your user datastore without ever setting up an account with the FusionAuth portal.

If you use FusionAuth Cloud or have a paid edition with advanced features, you need a FusionAuth portal account.

=== Billing

The [breadcrumb]#Billing# tab is where you can update your billing information and view invoices.
This tab is only useful if you are using a credit card to pay for your FusionAuth plan or deployments.

On this tab, view and modify aspects of your billing.
There's an overview of your billing status.

You can update your payment methods with a different credit card.
FusionAuth stores no credit card data internally; it all is stored in an external third party provider.

You can update current payment settings, including:

* the name on the invoice
* the tax identifier on the invoice
* the email address to which invoices are sent

You can view past invoices.
This can be useful when accounting is curious about a past bill.
No more filing a support ticket to see the invoice from six months ago!
