== Adding Users and Assigning Roles in the FusionAuth Admin UI

The FusionAuth administrative user interface allows you to assign one of several built-in roles to users registered with the FusionAuth admin application. These roles control access to functionality within the FusionAuth administrative user interface. See our page on [roles](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/roles#fusionauth-application-roles) for more information about roles in FusionAuth.

Customer service reps are likely to be assigned one of two roles:

* `user_support_viewer`: Users assigned this role can view user information in the FusionAuth admin UI.
* `user_support_manager`: A special role tuned for tier 1 technical support personnel that has a mix of capabilities.

To add a user in FusionAuth, the user-account must have a `user_manager` role, or the `user_support_manager` role, or of course the `admin` role.

As for assigning a role to a newly created user, only the `admin` can assign a role to a user.

=== Add a New User

To add a new user, log in to the FusionAuth admin UI using your admin credentials and select [Users] from the left sidebar of the dashboard.

Click on the blue "save" icon in the top right corner.

== Basic Authentication Operations

The FusionAuth admin UI provides a user-friendly interface for performing basic authentication operations. Here are some common tasks a user account manager may need to perform.

=== Send Password Reset

Use the Password Reset operation to help an end user regain access to their account.

* Log in to the FusionAuth admin UI.
* Search for the user whose password needs to be reset.
* Click on the user's name to open their user details page.
* Click on "Edit user" to open the dropdown.

* Confirm the password reset by clicking "Submit" in the popup.

=== Require Password Change

You might need a user to change their password for security reasons without sending a password reset email. You can use this feature to require the user to change their password the next time they log in.

* Log in to the FusionAuth admin UI.
* Search for the user who needs to reset their password.
* Click on the user's name to open their user details page.
* Click on "Edit user" to open the dropdown.

image::admin-guide/user-support-guide/image9.png[image,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped top-cropped]

* Select "Require password change" from the dropdown.

image::admin-guide/user-support-guide/image13.png[image,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped top-cropped]

* Click "Submit" in the "Confirm require password change" popup.

=== Verify User Information

You might need to verify if a user has provided meaningful information to his or her account to maintain accurate data in the system.

* Log in to the FusionAuth admin UI.
* Search for the user who needs to reset their password.
* Click on the user's name to open their user details page.
* Verify if all the information is correct, usually the email, phone number, birthdate and the username.

=== Log User Out


You might need to log a user out of their account for security reasons
 or data breaches or even for system maintenance. By terminating their session, you ensure that unauthorized individuals cannot access their account if they leave a device unattended or forget to log out themselves.

* Log in to the FusionAuth admin UI using your admin credentials.
* Search for the user who needs to log out.
* Click on the user's name to open their user details page.
* Navigate to the sessions panel on the bottom of the user details.
* Click on the red bin icon to clear the user's session and the user will be logged out.

=== Remove Action

* Log in to the FusionAuth admin UI using your admin credentials.
* Navigate to "Settings" in the left side bar
* Under Settings, select "User Actions"
* Navigate to the action you want to remove and press on the red bin icon to delete the action
* Confirm the action by typing in "DELETE" in the text-box provided and submit your request

image::admin-guide/user-support-guide/confirmDelete.png[image,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped top-cropped]



=== Soft Delete or Undelete User

The DELETE action is destructive and cannot be reversed. Alternatively, FusionAuth suggests that we may lock (de-activate) the user which is not destructive and may be reversed. Navigate to <<Lock Account>> for instructions on locking the Account.

=== Add A Comment

You can use User Comments to take notes on Users.

* Log in to the FusionAuth admin UI.
* Search for the user you want to leave a comment on.
* Click on the user's name to open the user details page.
* Click on "Edit user" to open the dropdown.
* Select the "Add a comment" option.

image::admin-guide/user-support-guide/image9.png[image,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped top-cropped]

* Add your comment to the "Comment" field and click "Submit" to save.

=== Lock Account

You might need to lock a user account for security or troubleshooting purposes. 

* Log in to the FusionAuth Admin UI.
* Search for the user whose account needs to be locked.
* Click on the user's name to open their user details page.
* Click on "Edit user" to open the dropdown.
* Select "Lock account".
