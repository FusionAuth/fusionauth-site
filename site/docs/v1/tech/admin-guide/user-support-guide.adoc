== Adding Users and Assigning Roles in the FusionAuth Admin UI

The FusionAuth administrative user interface allows you to assign one of several built-in roles to users registered with the FusionAuth admin application. These roles control access to functionality within the FusionAuth administrative user interface. Refer to the  link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/roles#fusionauth-application-roles[roles] documentation for more information about roles in FusionAuth.

Customer service reps are likely to be assigned one of two roles:

* `user_support_viewer`: Users assigned this role can view user information in the FusionAuth admin UI.
* `user_support_manager`: A special role tuned for tier 1 technical support personnel that has a mix of capabilities.

To add a user in FusionAuth, you need to have a `user_manager`, `user_support_manager`, or `admin` role.

Only a user with `admin` permissions can assign a role to an existing user.

=== Adding a New User

To add a new user, log in to the FusionAuth admin UI using your admin credentials and select [breadcrumb]#Users# from the left sidebar of the dashboard.

Complete the fields for the new user. You can choose to set the userâ€™s password or let the user set their own password by toggling the [uielement]#Send email to set up password# button.

Click on the icon:save[role=ui-button blue,type=fas] icon in the top right corner to save.

=== Assign a Role To a User

On the "Users" page, search for the user you will assign the role to and click on the icon:user[role=ui-button purple,type=fas] icon in the action column to open the user details page.
