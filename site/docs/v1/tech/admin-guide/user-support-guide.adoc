*Introduction:*

FusionAuth is an authentication provider that simplifies the process of
adding authentication features to applications without rebuilding common
components.

This guide is designed to provide instructions for Customer Service
representatives on using FusionAuth, an authentication provider, to
support users with their authentication needs. Customer Service
representatives play a vital role in assisting users who may encounter
issues related to login, password resets, and account lockouts.
FusionAuth simplifies these processes by allowing Customer Service
representatives to manage user accounts and perform necessary actions
without having to rebuild common authentication components. By following
this guide, you will learn how to use FusionAuth's Admin UI to reset
passwords, verify user information, log users out, remove actions that
locked accounts, and perform soft delete/undelete operations.

*Who is this Document For?*

This document is intended for Customer Service representatives who are
responsible for assisting users with authentication-related issues.
Customer Service representatives typically interact with users who may
have trouble accessing their accounts, forgetting passwords, or
experiencing other login-related challenges. By using FusionAuth's
features, Customer Service representatives can efficiently address these
concerns, enhance user experience, and help maintain a secure
authentication environment.

*Why Customer Service Representatives Might Use FusionAuth:*

Customer Service representatives may need to utilize FusionAuth for
various reasons. Here is an example scenario to illustrate why Customer
Service representatives might perform specific actions:

Suppose a user contacts Customer Service reporting that they have
forgotten their account password and are unable to log in. In such a
case, a Customer Service representative can use FusionAuth to reset the
user's password, allowing them to regain access to their account without
the need for manual intervention from developers or administrators. By
using FusionAuth's Admin UI, Customer Service representatives can
securely manage user accounts, resolve authentication-related issues
promptly, and provide a seamless user experience.

Now, let's dive into the step-by-step instructions for setting up the
Admin UI and the common operations performed by Customer Service
representatives using FusionAuth's Admin UI:

. *Remove an Action that Locked an Account:*

____
Keep in mind that “Soft Delete” and “Remove an Action that Locked an
Account” are different:

In FusionAuth, "soft delete" refers to marking a user account as deleted
without permanently removing it. On the other hand, "remove an action"
allows you to specifically address and modify the action that caused the
account lockout. While unlocking the account is one option, FusionAuth
also provides flexibility to change or remove the action entirely
through its Admin UI:

{empty}i. Log in to the FusionAuth Admin UI.

{empty}ii. Search for the user whose account is locked.

{empty}iii. Click on the user's name to open their user details page.

{empty}iv. Under the "Actions" tab, and find the actions that have
locked the user’s account

{empty}v. Submit the request to remove or resolve the action that caused
the account lockout.

. *Soft Delete/Undelete a User:*

____
Soft delete allows you to temporarily disable a user account while
retaining its data. This is useful when dealing with temporary account
suspensions or other similar situations. Permanent deletion, on the
other hand, involves permanently removing a user's account and
associated data from the system.

{empty}ii. Search for the user who is soft-deleted.

{empty}iii. Click on the user's name to open their user details page.

as per your requirement.
