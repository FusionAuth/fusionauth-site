== Adding Users and Assigning Roles in the FusionAuth Admin UI

The FusionAuth administrative user interface allows you to assign one of several built-in roles to users registered with the FusionAuth admin application. These roles control access to functionality within the FusionAuth administrative user interface. See our page on [roles](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/roles#fusionauth-application-roles) for more information about roles in FusionAuth.

Customer service reps are likely to be assigned one of two roles:

* `user_support_viewer`: Users assigned this role can view user information in the FusionAuth admin UI.
* `user_support_manager`: A special role tuned for tier 1 technical support personnel that has a mix of capabilities.

=== Add a New User

To add a new user, log in to the FusionAuth admin UI using your admin credentials and select [Users] from the left sidebar of the dashboard.
