== Overview:

This guide is designed to provide instructions for Customer Service
representatives on using FusionAuth, an authentication provider, to
support users with their authentication needs. Customer Service
representatives play a vital role in assisting users who may encounter
issues related to login, password resets, and account lockouts.
FusionAuth simplifies these processes by allowing Customer Service
representatives to manage user accounts and perform necessary actions
without having to rebuild common authentication components. By following
this guide, you will learn how to use FusionAuth's Admin UI to reset
passwords, verify user information, log users out, remove actions that
locked accounts, and perform soft delete/undelete operations.

== Who is this Document For?

This document is intended for Customer Service representatives who are
responsible for assisting users with authentication-related issues.
Customer Service representatives typically interact with users who may
have trouble accessing their accounts, forgetting passwords, or
experiencing other login-related challenges. By using FusionAuth's
features, Customer Service representatives can efficiently address these
concerns, enhance user experience, and help maintain a secure
authentication environment.

Now without wasting much of your time, let's dive into the step-by-step instructions for setting up the
Admin UI and the common operations performed by Customer Service
representatives using FusionAuth's Admin UI:

== Setting up the FusionAuth Admin UI for Customer Service Reps:

* Log in to the FusionAuth Admin UI using your admin credentials.

You will be presented with the interface that looks like the one below:

image::admin-guide/user-support-guide/image2.png[image,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped top-cropped]

And since you  have the admin role, you will be presented with the entire dashboard with operations related to this role.

* Navigate to "Users" in the left sidebar.

image::admin-guide/user-support-guide/image3.png[image,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped top-cropped]

And navigate to the user listed in the result page. Click on that blue
icon under the Action column in that result set to “Manage” the User.

* And on the top bar with the current route namely User/Home/Users navigate to the green + icon which is the “Add User” button. Click on that green icon and you will get a form to add a new user:

image::admin-guide/user-support-guide/image5.png[image,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped top-cropped]

Set the user’s password if you want but there is also an option to let the user set the password by allowing the the system to send the email to the user containing steps to set the password. For simplicity we are going to set the password for them.

* Click on the blue save icon in the top right corner and your user is created.

The next step is to assign the user that we created a specific role, in this case we are going to assign “user support manager” role to this user.

* Navigate to “Users” and on the user that we created, under the “Action” column click on the blue icon to “Manage” the user.
* Scroll down and press on the “Add registration” button

You will get a form like this:


image::admin-guide/user-support-guide/image7.png[image,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped top-cropped]

* Scroll down and view the entire Roles panel.
* Tick on the role named "user support manager".


image::admin-guide/user-support-guide/image8.png[image,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped top-cropped]

Go ahead and save your changes and review the newly created user as below

image::admin-guide/user-support-guide/image8.1.png[image,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped top-cropped]

logout and try to login using the newly created account

image::admin-guide/user-support-guide/image8.2.png[image,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped top-cropped]

image::admin-guide/user-support-guide/image8.3.png[image,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped top-cropped]

We are now logged in as Sarah with the role of user support manager. If you look closely on the left side bar for Sarah, she now have a view with limited information based on her role that we assigned her.
She also have limited Operations that she can do as a user support manager that we are going to look at in a bit.

To create another user with the role “user support viewer” we just follow the same steps as above an assign the role to “user_support_viewer”.

image::admin-guide/user-support-guide/image8.4.png[image,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped top-cropped]

For a "user support viewer" role there isn’t much the user can do in terms of operation, all he or she can do is to view and is not allowed to make any changes whatsoever.
So we are going to look at the operations what the user account manager can do.
