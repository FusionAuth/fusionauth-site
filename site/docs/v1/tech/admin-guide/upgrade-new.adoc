First:

reasons to upgrade
reasons to not upgrade
being aware of upgrade options, include release notifications
Second, how to think about upgrades:

Read the release notes. How do I tell if something affects me?
How do I upgrade my custom theme (need to document how to do a diff of theme changes across versions, maybe even start a project that does that--pulls down the default theme from each released version of FusionAuth and commits it to a GH repo, perhaps part of this: https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-theme-helper )
How do I migrate FusionAuth config changes between environments (pointing to/extracting content from this https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/admin-guide/configuration-management )
How can I upgrade my database with minimal downtime?
How do I switch out nodes if running in a cluster? What happens when the first node is switched out (it checks for the correct schema and upgrades if needed).
How to handle main use cases: in dev envt, in docker/kubernetes, in cluster.
Should I upgrade from 1.37 -> 1.43 jumping versions or step by step?
How can customer know if upgrade will cause downtime? Can they use a staging envrionment to do so? If db migration is shown, yes, otherwise maybe? are there dev team todos to make this clearer? Can we talk about durations for a reference architecture. 

Differentiate between an upgrade that has downtime around admin functionality and upgrade that affects end user login functionality (the old control plane/data plane metaphor)

How to upgrade cloud instances (probably just excerpt the section in the cloud install guide)

How do I know when a node is ready to serve traffic? Helm charts check /, some guidance around checking /api/status. Do we need a new endpoint?

What is silent mode? It is make maintenance mode work, no prompts, non-silent mode means gui shows up asking for db connection info.


Third, upgrade options:

Easiest path

take everything down, upgrade everything, start it back up,
fusionatuh owns the schema, full outage
Rolling upgrade

If you have 3 nodes:

Upgrade one node at a time behind an LB

before adding upgraded node load balancer, node 1 upgrades
or take node 2 and 3 at same time, so lose capacity, not schema mismatch
Can stand up entirely new infra or run in-place upgrades using dpkg -i

blue/green deployment

Stand up 3 new nodes with new version on it. When adding node 4, it will lock db and own it. nodes 1, 2, 3 may error, may want to remove them. You can add node 4,5,6 at same time as you remove node 1,2,3, or wait for node 4 to complete upgrade. Again, this gets to informing the admin what the impact of an upgrade is.

Out of band DB upgrades

Another option do database updates out of band by yourself. If you have a three node cluster:

stand up 3 new nodes with new version
add maintenance page
take all old version out of service
run db updates using SQL
connect three new nodes to the database (maybe need to bounce to get them to reconnect)
add to load balancer.
put in diagrams if possible

faqs

what is runtime mode and how does that affect upgrades
what is maintenance mode
what silent mode means
how many versions can I skip

we recommended migrating from one minor version to the next over
how often should I upgrade
whenever you want. it is your dependency and we won't force you. we recommend staying relatively close to the latest release. in addition, we don't typically backport bug fixes. so if you run into an issue, you'll need to upgrade to get the fix
how can I find out about new releases
