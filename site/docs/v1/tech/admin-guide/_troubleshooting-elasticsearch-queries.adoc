When you are troubleshooting Elasticsearch queries, running them against the Elasticsearch server is helpful.

[WARNING.warning]
====
If you are running in FusionAuth Cloud, you cannot access Elasticsearch in the manner described here.
====

When running FusionAuth locally in Docker, you can expose the Elasticsearch port by adding the following lines to your `docker-compose.yml` file and restarting.

[source,yaml] 
.Exposing Elasticsearch Ports
----
# ... other stuff
  search:
# ... other stuff
    ports:
      - 9200:9200
----

Once you've opened up the port, you can query Elasticsearch directly. Here's an example of a single field query.

[source,shell] 
.Example Of Querying Elasticsearch Directly
----
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/_search?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d' 
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "data.Company": {
        "query": "PiedPiper"
      }
    }
  }
}'
----

When you run this curl command, you'll get back results similar to below.

[source,json] 
.Results Of Querying Elasticsearch Directly
----
{
  "took" : 6,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 10,
    "successful" : 10,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 3,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 2.0,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "fusionauth_user",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003",
        "_score" : 2.0
      },
      {
        "_index" : "fusionauth_user",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000006",
        "_score" : 2.0
      },
      {
        "_index" : "fusionauth_user",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000005",
        "_score" : 2.0
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

When debugging, examine the `hits.hits` array. The `_id` value corresponds to the user Id that matched your query. If the content or number of users returned are different than expected, modify the query.
