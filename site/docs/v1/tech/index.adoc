== Documentation Conventions

- We apitalize all domain objects, especially when calling the API in which the object is created and/or updated in FusionAuth.
For example, see the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/api-keys[API Key API] description for `apiKeyId`, where API Key is capitalized: `The unique Id of the API Key to create. If not specified a secure random UUID will be generated.`
- If referring to something which is a domain object in FusionAuth, but we are not explicitly referring to an object being created/updated in FusionAuth, we use lowercase.
    Here are some examples:
`To allow users to log into and use your application, youâ€™ll need to create an Application in FusionAuth.`
- From the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/identity-providers/links[Link API], note the difference between a FusionAuth User and a 3rd party user: `This API is used to create a link between a FusionAuth User and a user in a 3rd party identity provider. This API may be useful when you already know the unique Id of a user in a 3rd party identity provider and the corresponding FusionAuth User.`

Thanks for choosing FusionAuth!
