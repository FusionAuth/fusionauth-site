Now that everything is written, let's test the workflow. We can fire up the Node.js application using this command:

[source,shell script,title=Start the node server]
----
npm start
----

Open `http://localhost:3000/` in an incognito browser.

[NOTE.note]
====
You need to use an incognito browser because otherwise FusionAuth won't prompt you to login. You have already logged into FusionAuth when you configured the application above, and will be recognized.

FusionAuth supports single sign-on, and will automatically redirect you to the application if you are already logged in with the FusionAuth server.

Click the `Login` link, this will take us to FusionAuth's login page.

From here, you can log in with the account you used to access the admin user interface above. If you log in with a valid account that is registered for the application, you arrive at the home page, but are greeted by name.

In a real application, there'd be a lot more than a "Hello" message, but this is a building block. You've successfully authenticated and stored user data in the express session. From here, you can add other pages, hide or display information based on attributes of the user, and more.

If, on the other hand, you log in with an account that exists in FusionAuth but is not registered for the application, you'll end up at an error page.

This error message and overall page look and feel can be modified via a custom FusionAuth theme.
