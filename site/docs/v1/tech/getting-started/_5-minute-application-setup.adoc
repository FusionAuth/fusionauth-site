Once you arrive in the FusionAuth admin UI, the first thing you need to do is create an Application. An Application is something that a user can log into. This is the application you are building or that you are migrating to use FusionAuth. Click the [breadcrumb]#Application# menu option on the left side of the page or the **Setup** button in the box at the top of the page.

This will take you to the listing page for Applications. Next, you'll click the green plus button (the add button) at the top of the page:

On the Application form, provide a name for your Application (this is only used for display purposes) and a couple of items on the OAuth tab. Start with a simple setup that allows existing users to log into your application. There is no need to add any roles or registration configuration. 

When you click on the OAuth tab, you'll see these options:

Most of the defaults will work, but provide these items:

* An authorized redirect URL. This is the route/controller in your application's backend that will complete the OAuth grant and obtain a token. For this example, add `\http://localhost:3000/oauth-redirect`. You will see example code below for this route.
* Specify a valid [field]#Logout URL#. This is where the user will be redirected to after they are logged out of FusionAuth's OAuth front-end: your application. For this example, set this value to `\http://localhost:3000/logout`. You'll see how this is used below.
* Make sure the Authorization Code grant is selected in the [field]#Enabled Grants#.
* Set the [field]#Require registration# field to `true`.

Once you have configured the application, you'll click the blue "Save" button at the top of the page.

Then, click on the green magnifying glass on the list view next to your application. Scroll down to the [breadcrumb]#OAuth Configuration# section and copy the [field]#Client Id# and [field]#Client Secret# values off to a text file. You'll use them later.
