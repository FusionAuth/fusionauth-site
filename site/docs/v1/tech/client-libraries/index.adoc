== Overview

Client libraries and SDKs will help you quickly integrate your application with FusionAuth. All of our client libraries are open source and hosted on our https://github.com/FusionAuth[GitHub account]. You can fork and tweak them as well as look over the code to learn how the client libraries work.

== SDKs vs Client Libraries

At FusionAuth, a **client library** is a thin wrapper over our FusionAuth APIs, and it provides complete coverage over all public FusionAuth API endpoints. A client library is like a set of legos, to be put together by a developer who wants to extend or manipulate FusionAuth to meet their needs.

You can use a client library to manage FusionAuth. For instance, if you wanted to rotate client secrets regularly, you could use a client library to do so.

It can also be used to integrate with a custom application to offer login experiences that are different from those that are offered out of the box. If, in your app, you wanted to prompt someone for a username first, then do a lookup, then offer them a custom password field, then prompt them to enter their favorite color, use a client library to perform these complicated, custom operations.

At FusionAuth, an **SDK** is an opinionated set of higher level constructs. These focus on a subset of functionality. These are like an assembled lego set.

These let you quickly accomplish the common tasks and are often targeted at developers working on the front end: mobile/React/Vue/Angular/JavaScript developers. 

FusionAuth SDKs have:

* A button/function for logging in
* A button/function for logging out
* A button/function to register the user
* A filter/some way to examine roles and limit information displayed to a given role or set of roles
* A way to refresh a token without asking the user to reauthenticate.
* Secure access and refresh token storage

SDKs should require minimal customization to use.

If you want both the easy solutions provided by an SDK and the fine-grained control provided by a client library, you can use an SDK and a client library in the same application.

== Languages

If we are missing a language, open a https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues[GitHub Issue] as a Feature Request if you don't see it already listed as an open feature.

=== Deprecated Client Libraries

These client libraries still work and are built for every release, but are deprecated. For new projects, prefer the alternative.

* link:/docs/v1/tech/client-libraries/javascript[JavaScript Client Library] (deprecated, prefer link:/docs/v1/tech/client-libraries/typescript[Typescript Client Library])
* link:/docs/v1/tech/client-libraries/node[Node Client Library] (deprecated, prefer link:/docs/v1/tech/client-libraries/typescript[Typescript Client Library])

== Versioning

Client library versions track the API. The API will only change with a major or minor version release, not with a patch release.

You should use the version of a client library that corresponds to your version of FusionAuth. If that is not available, use the latest release of the client library for the minor version.
