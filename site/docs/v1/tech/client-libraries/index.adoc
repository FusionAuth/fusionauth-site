== Overview

Client libraries will help you quickly integrate your application with FusionAuth. All of our client libraries are open source and hosted on our https://github.com/FusionAuth[GitHub] account. You can fork and tweak them as well as look over the code to learn how the client libraries work.

== Versioning

Client library versions track the API. The API will only change with a major or minor version release, not with a patch release.

You should use the version of a client library that corresponds to your version of FusionAuth. If that is not available, use the latest release of the client library for the minor version.
