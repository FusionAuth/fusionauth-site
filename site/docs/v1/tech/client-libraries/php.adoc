== PHP Client Library

The PHP client library allows you to integrate FusionAuth with your PHP application.

Source code:

* https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-php-client

Packagist:

* https://packagist.org/packages/fusionauth/fusionauth-client

```bash
composer require fusionauth/fusionauth-client
```

The following code assumes FusionAuth is running on `\http://localhost:9011` and uses an API key `6b87a398-39f2-4692-927b-13188a81a9a3`, you will need to supply your own API key, and if you are not running FusionAuth locally, your host parameter may be different.

Here is an example of using the `retrieveUserByEmail` method to retrieve a User by an email address.

[source,javascript]
----
include_once 'FusionAuthClient.php'

$client = new FusionAuthClient('6b87a398-39f2-4692-927b-13188a81a9a3', 'http://localhost:9011');

$email = "user@example.com";
$response = client->retrieveUserByEmail($email);
if ($response->wasSuccessful()) {
  $user = $response->successResponse->user;
} else {
  // Handle $response->errorResponse or $response->exception
}
