[NOTE.deprecated]
====
The following client library is now deprecated in favor of the link:/docs/v1/tech/client-libraries/typescript[typescript] client, as it can do everything this project can but with better type support and examples.
====

== JavaScript Client Library

The JavaScript client library allows you to integrate FusionAuth with your JavaScript application.

Source Code:

* https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-javascript-client

[NOTE]
====
Please note that if you will be using this client library in front end code such as a web browser you will not have a secure way to store an API key. You may optionally pass a value of `null` for the API key parameter and still make API requests that do not require an API key.
====

The following code assumes FusionAuth is running on `\http://localhost:9011` and uses an API key `6b87a398-39f2-4692-927b-13188a81a9a3`, you will need to supply your own API key, and if you are not running FusionAuth locally, your host parameter may be different.

Here is an example of using the `retrieveUserByEmail` method to retrieve a User by an email address.

      function handleResponse (clientResponse) {
        console.info(JSON.stringify(clientResponse.successResponse.user, null, 2));
      }

      // Retrieve User by Email Address
      client.retrieveUserByEmail('user@example.com', handleResponse);
