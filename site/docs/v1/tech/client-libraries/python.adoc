== Python Client Library

The Python client library allows you to integrate FusionAuth with your Python application.

Source code:

* https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-python-client

PyPI Package:

* https://pypi.org/project/fusionauth-client/

To install the FusionAuth Python Client package run:

```bash
pip install fusionauth-client
```


The following code assumes FusionAuth is running on `http://localhost:9011` and uses an API key `6b87a398-39f2-4692-927b-13188a81a9a3`, you will need to supply your own API key, and if you are not running FusionAuth locally, your host parameter may be different.

Here is an example of using the `create_user` method to create, and then the `retrieveUserByEmail` method to retrieve the User by email address.

[source,python]
----
from fusionauth.fusionauth_client import FusionAuthClient


#  You must supply your API key and URL here
client = FusionAuthClient('6b87a398-39f2-4692-927b-13188a81a9a3', 'http://localhost:9011')

user_request = {
    'sendSetPasswordEmail': False,
    'skipVerification': True,
    'user': {
        'email': 'art@vandaleyindustries.com',
        'password': 'password'
    }
}

client_response = client.create_user(None, user_request)

# Create a User
if client_response.was_successful():
    print(client_response.success_response)
else:
    print(client_response.error_response)

# Retrieve a user by email address
client_response = client.retrieve_user_by_email('art@vandaleyindustries.com')
if client_response.was_successful():
    print(client_response.success_response)
else:
    print(client_response.error_response)
