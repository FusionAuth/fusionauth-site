You may use this client library in an application that cannot securely store secrets, such as a native mobile application or a single page application running in the browser. 

In this scenario, you should disable [field]#Require authentication# in the FusionAuth Application configuration and use https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636[PKCE] to secure communication with the Token endpoint.

You can use the `exchangeOAuthCodeForAccessTokenUsingPKCE` client method to do so.
