== Configuration Reference

FusionAuth configuration is managed in a number of ways, depending on the item being configured. The majority of application level settings are managed in the UI or the APIs. Other items such as memory, ports, and other system configuration options are managed through a lookup process. This process uses environment variables, Java system properties, and the key value pairs in the `fusionauth.properties` file.

=== Lookup process

[NOTE.since]
====
Available Since Version 1.19.0.
====

The lookup process was introduced in version link:/docs/v1/tech/release-notes#version-1-19-0[`1.19.0`] and allows any configuration option to be specified in one of three ways: environment variables, Java system properties, or in the `fusionauth.properties` configuration file. Here is the process for looking up configuration options (NOTE: that the name of the configuration options are listed below):

1. Check if an environment variable is defined with the configuration option name
2. Check if an environment variable is defined with the configuration option name translated by upper-casing it and replacing periods and dashes with underscores
3. Check if there is a Java system property with the configuration option name
4. Check if the configuration option is defined in the `fusionauth.properties` configuration file

To better illustrate how the lookup works, let's take one of the common configuration options for FusionAuth and walk through each step. We'll use `database.url` which defines the JDBC URL where the database is located. Here's how the lookup will work:

1. Check for an environment variable named `database.url`
2. Check for an environment variable named `DATABASE_URL`
3. Check for a Java System property defined like this: `-Ddatabase.url=foo`
4. Check if there is a line in `fusionauth.properties` like this: `database.url=foo`

This lookup order is consistent for every configuration option listed below.

=== Configuration file

Assuming you installed in the default locations, the configuration file may be found in the following directory. If you have installed in an alternate location the path to this file will be different.

[source,text]
.Linux and macOS
----
/usr/local/fusionauth/config/fusionauth.properties
----

[source,text]
.Windows
----
\fusionauth\config\fusionauth.properties
----

=== Options

The following table contains all of the configuration options that FusionAuth uses. For your convenience, you may select the type of configuration you plan to use and the names will be updated to correspond to your preference.

[.api]
[field]#database.connection-healthcheck-99percent-ms# [type]#[Integer]# [default]#defaults to `250`#::
This ensures that the average time it takes FusionAuth to get a database connection from the connection pool does not go above the specified value. If this value is exceeded, then the `/api/status` API will return a non-200 status code. This usually means that the database is under heavy load or is having issues.

[field]#database.connection-timeout# [type]#[Integer]# [default]#defaults to `2,000`#::
The number of milliseconds that FusionAuth will attempt to connect to the database before failing.

[field]#database.idle-timeout# [type]#[Integer]# [default]#defaults to `120,000`#::
The number of milliseconds that FusionAuth will leave an idle database connection in its connection pool before recreating it.

[field]#database.max-lifetime# [type]#[Integer]# [default]#defaults to `240,000`#::
The number of milliseconds that FusionAuth will allow a database connection to live before it is destroyed and recreated.

[field]#database.minimum-idle# [type]#[Integer]# [default]#defaults to `unset`#::
The minimum number of idle connections that FusionAuth will keep in the connection pool. This ensures that the pool always has that number of connections. By default, this is not set, so the connection pool will be a fixed size of the value of the `maximum-pool-size` configuration option.

[field]#database.maximum-pool-size# [type]#[Integer]# [default]#defaults to `10`#::
The maximum number of database connections that FusionAuth will keep in the connection pool.

[field]#database.mysql.enforce-utf8mb4# [type]#[String]# [default]#defaults to `true`#::
When set to `true` and using MySQL, a 4 byte UTF compatible character set configuration is enforced at startup.
+
If this validation is not desired or not it is not possible to modify your MySQL configuration to satisfy the validation, disable this check by setting this value to `false`. If this is `false`, any attempt to store a 4 byte unicode character will cause the `INSERT` or `UPDATE` request to fail. The initial MySQL UTF-8 implementation only supported up to characters up to 3 bytes in length; utf8mb4 extends this to 4 byte characters.

[field]#database.password# [type]#[String]#::
The password that FusionAuth will use to connect to the database. If you are using link:/docs/v1/tech/guides/silent-mode/[Silent Mode] or link:/docs/v1/tech/tutorials/setup-wizard/[Setup Wizard], then this password might be used when the `database.user` is automatically created for you, depending on your database server and configuration options.
+
Keep in mind, that this password must be secure if you let FusionAuth create the database user for you.

[field]#database.root.password# [type]#[String]#::
The password that FusionAuth will use to connect to the database server as part of link:/docs/v1/tech/guides/silent-mode/[Silent Mode] or link:/docs/v1/tech/tutorials/setup-wizard/[Setup Wizard] if it cannot connect using the `database.username` and `database.password` values. This should be the password for a user that has superuser privileges to the database. For example, many PostgreSQL servers will provide you with a password for the `postgres` user. Similarly, MySQL servers sometimes leave the password blank for the `mysql` user.
+
This configuration option allows FusionAuth to create its own database and schema and also create the user specified by `database.username` with the password specified by `database.password`. This setting is useful for Docker and other containers where FusionAuth needs to bootstrap itself without any user interaction.

[field]#database.root.username# [type]#[String]#::
The password that FusionAuth will use to connect to the database server as part of link:/docs/v1/tech/guides/silent-mode/[Silent Mode] or link:/docs/v1/tech/tutorials/setup-wizard/[Setup Wizard] if it cannot connect using the `database.username` and `database.password` values. This should be the username that has superuser privileges to the database. For example, many PostgreSQL servers use the username of `postgres` for the superuser account. Similarly, MySQL servers often use the username `mysql` for the superuser account.
+
This configuration option allows FusionAuth to create its own database and schema and also create the user specified by `database.username` with the password specified by `database.password`. This setting is useful for Docker and other containers where FusionAuth needs to bootstrap itself without any user interaction.
+
[.deprecated]
Deprecated names:
+
* database.root.user

[field]#database.url# [type]#[String]#::
The JDBC URL that FusionAuth can use to connect to the configured database.
+
Consider the examples below and review each part of the URL string as you may need to adjust it for your configuration.
+
[quote]
jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/fusionauth
+
    * Database type: PostgreSQL
    * Database host: db
    * Database port: 5432
    * Database name: fusionauth
+
In the example above, notice we have specified the PostgreSQL jdbc type, a host of `db`, a port `5432` and a database name of `fusionauth`. The host is the service name of the database configuration, in this case it is named `db`.
+
[quote]
jdbc:mysql://db:3306/fusionauth?serverTimezone=UTC
+
    * Database type: MySQL
    * Database host: db
    * Database port: 3306
    * Database name: fusionauth
    * Server timezone: UTC
+
In the example above, notice we have specified the MySQL jdbc type, a host of `db`, a port `3306`, a database name of `fusionauth`, and the server timezone `UTC`.
+
If you are using MySQL, you must include the `serverTimezone=UTC` parameter in the URL. The `?` character is the same as a standard URL parameter, so if you have additional parameters, you should only have a single `?` and parameters should be separated by `&`.
+
You may also wish to connect to a remote database, in that case you will provide your own JDBC string URL specifying the remote database host and port.
+
Some MySQL services such as Microsoft Azure may require a specific version of TLS to connect successfully. At the time of writing this note, the MySQL connector will not attempt to utilize TLSv1.2 by default, so when connecting to a service that requires this version you will need to explicitly request this version of TLS on the connection string. For example, appending this `enabledTLSProtocols=TLSv1.2` to the connection string will allow you to successfully connect to an Azure managed MySQL database. See https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/8.0/en/connector-j-reference-using-ssl.html[MySQL Connector : Connecting Securely UsingSSL] for additional information.

[field]#database.username# [type]#[String]#::
The database user that FusionAuth will use to connect to the database. If you are using link:/docs/v1/tech/guides/silent-mode/[Silent Mode] or link:/docs/v1/tech/tutorials/setup-wizard/[Setup Wizard], then this user might be automatically created for you, depending on your database server and configuration options. If this user is created as part of link:/docs/v1/tech/guides/silent-mode/[Silent Mode] or link:/docs/v1/tech/tutorials/setup-wizard/[Setup Wizard], it will also be the owner of the database and schema for FusionAuth.

[field]#fusionauth-app.reindex-batch-size# [type]#[Integer]# [default]#defaults to `1000`#::
The number of users to process per batch for a reindex operation.

[field]#fusionauth-app.reindex-thread-count# [type]#[Integer]# [default]#defaults to `2`#::
The number of threads to process batches of users on for a reindex operation.

[field]#fusionauth-app.runtime-mode# [type]#[String]# [default]#defaults to `development`# [since]#Available since 1.16.0#::
The FusionAuth runtime mode. The runtime mode causes some features to be modified based upon this configuration.
+
The possible values are:
+
  * `development`
  * `production`
+
When in the `development` runtime mode, maintenance mode will interactively assist you configuring the database and connecting to Elasticsearch if configured. Once you move FusionAuth into production, it is recommended that you modify the runtime mode to `production`. When in `production` runtime mode maintenance mode will no longer be available to you which means you can be certain that your end users will not find themselves on the database upgrade panel during an Upgrade. When in `production` mode you will either need to leverage link:/docs/v1/tech/guides/silent-mode/[Silent Mode] to automatically apply database migrations or you will need to apply the database migrations yourself (either by hand or via a script of some sort).
+
[.deprecated]
Deprecated names:
+
* fusionauth.runtime-mode

[field]#fusionauth-app.silent-mode# [type]#[Boolean]# [default]#defaults to `true`# [since]#Available since 1.19.0#::
Determines if FusionAuth should use link:/docs/v1/tech/guides/silent-mode/[Silent Mode] during the startup process. Previous to version `1.19.0`, Silent Mode was only available when the [field]#fusionauth-app.runtime-mode# was `development`. This has been changed so that FusionAuth can now automatically apply database migrations during the startup process.

[field]#fusionauth-app.url# [type]#[String]# [since]#Available since 1.4.0#::
The FusionAuth App URL that is used to communicate with other FusionAuth nodes. This value is defaulted if not specified to use a localhost address or a site local if available. Unless you have multiple FusionAuth nodes the generated value should always work. You may need to manually specify this value if you have multiple FusionAuth nodes and the only way the nodes can communicate is on a public network.

[field]#fusionauth-app.user-search-index.name# [type]#[String]# [default]#defaults to `fusionauth_user`# [since]#Available since 1.22.0#::
The name of the Elasticsearch index that will be created by FusionAuth to index users.

[field]#fusionauth-search.additional-java-args# [type]#[String]#::
include::docs/v1/tech/reference/_property-additional-jvm-args.adoc[]
+
[.deprecated]
Deprecated names:
+
* fusionauthsearch.additional.java.args

[field]#fusionauth-search.data-directory# [type]#[String (Path)]#::
The location on disk where FusionAuth Search will store its data. This value is defaulted if not specified and generally should not be modified.
+
[.deprecated]
Deprecated names:
+
* fusionauthsearch.data.directory

[field]#fusionauth-search.hosts# [type]#[String]# [default]#defaults to `\_local_`#::
This parameter indicates which address or network interfaces to bind during service startup. The default value will cause the service to bind  any loopback address on the system such as `127.0.0.1`.
+
This default value is sufficient for running FusionAuth and the Search Engine on the same server. If you run FusionAuth Search on a separate system than FusionAuth App you will need to modify this value. You may specify a single hostname or IP address or one of the special values in any combination.
+
Special values include:
+
    * `\_[networkInterface]_` - Addresses of a network interface, for example `\_en0_`
    * `\_local_` - Any loopback address on the system, for example `127.0.0.1`
    * `\_site_` - Any site-local addresses on the system, for example `192.168.0.1`.
    * `\_global_` - Any globally-scoped addresses on the system, for example `8.8.8.8`.
+
The following is an example to bind to `localhost` as well as any site local addresses on the system such at `192.168.1.42`.
+

+
[.deprecated]
Deprecated names:
+
* fusionauth-search.http-port

[field]#fusionauth-search.memory# [type]#[String (Memory)]# [default]#defaults to `512M`#::
include::docs/v1/tech/reference/_property-memory.adoc[]
+
[.deprecated]
Deprecated names:
+
* fusionauthsearch.memory

[field]#fusionauth-search.servers# [type]#[String]# [default]#defaults to `localhost:9020`# [deprecated]#No longer used as of `1.16.0`#::
A comma separated list of stand-alone search engine servers that will be used by FusionAuth. The port specified on the server should be the Search Engine Transport port, not the HTTP port.
+
The following is an example of a configuration for two separate search engines, one running on localhost and the other is on remote system.
+
[quote]
`fusionauth-search.servers=localhost:9020,search2.example.com:9020`
+
This configuration value is used by the FusionAuth Search and the FusionAuth App services. Even when running FusionAuth App without FusionAuth Search on the same server this configuration value will need to be provided.

[field]#fusionauth-search.transport.port# [type]#[Integer]# [default]#defaults to `9020`#::
The port that the search engine will use for optimized TCP communications instead of HTTP communications. This port is used internally by the search engine to communicate between clustered nodes.
+
[.deprecated]
Deprecated names:
+
* fusionauth-search.transport-port
* fusionauthsearch.transport.port

[field]#search.servers# [type]#[String]# [default]#defaults to `http://localhost:9021`#::
A comma separated list of URLs that will be used by FusionAuth to connect to the search engine. The port specified on the URL should be the Search Engine HTTP port. (see `fusionauth-search.http-port`) It is not recommended to ever run the FusionAuth Search open to the public internet.
+
The following is an example of a configuration for two separate search engines, one running on localhost and the other is on a remote system.
+
[quote]
`search.servers=http://localhost:9021,http://search2.example.com:9021`
+
[.deprecated]
Deprecated names:
+
* fusionauth-app.search-servers

[field]#search.sniffer# [type]#[Boolean]# [default]#defaults to `false`# [since]#Available since 1.19.8#::
Set to `true` if you want to use the Elasticsearch sniffer configuration. If you are using a managed Elasticsearch service, or running Elasticsearch inside of a container, you should leave this value set to `false`.
+
This configuration can be helpful to allow FusionAuth to use a single connection to `localhost` and then allow the Elasticsearch REST client to discover all other nodes in the Elasticsearch cluster.

[field]#search.type# [type]#[String]# [default]#defaults to `database`# [since]#Available since 1.16.0#::
The search engine type.  The possible values are:
+
  * `database`
  * `elasticsearch`
+
When configuring the search engine type to `elasticsearch`, you must configure the [field]#search.servers# property as well.
+
