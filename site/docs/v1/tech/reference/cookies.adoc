title: Hosted Login Pages Cookies
description: A list of cookies set by the FusionAuth Hosted Login pages
navcategory: admin

== Overview

Cookies are a critical part of web applications.

When you call certain APIs, such as the Login API, cookies may be set. Such cookies are specified in the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/[API documentation].

When you use the link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/integration-points#hosted-login-pages[hosted login pages], FusionAuth uses cookies to enable functionality.

== Domains

The domain of all cookies is the domain on which the FusionAuth instance is running. You can control the domain FusionAuth uses by link:/docs/v1/tech/admin-guide/proxy-setup[setting up a proxy].

In other words, if FusionAuth serves requests at `auth.piedpiper.com`, it will only set cookies for this value: `auth.piedpiper.com`. It will never set cookies for `.piedpiper.com`.
