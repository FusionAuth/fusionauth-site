Database configuration is limited to a single host. Using a valid JDBC URL with multiple hosts is not currently supported. 

There's a https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1436[tracking issue] to support more database configuration options.

The format of the database username has some limitations as well. In particular, the username cannot contain an `@` symbol. Please review the https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1036[tracking issue] for more information.
