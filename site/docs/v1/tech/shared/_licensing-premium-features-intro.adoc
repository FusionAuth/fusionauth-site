FusionAuth will always have a powerful, full featured free-to-use Community edition.
This is the foundation of FusionAuth and the community surrounding it and as an organization FusionAuth is committed to improving the Community edition, with both features and bug fixes.

However, there are additional tiers of functionality which meet the needs of different types of organizations and offer premium features.
For these editions, a license is required.

You can learn more about purchasing FusionAuth editions other than Community on the link:/pricing[pricing page].
