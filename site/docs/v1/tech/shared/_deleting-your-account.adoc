To delete your account, take the following steps, in this order:

1. https://account.fusionauth.io/[Log into your account].
2. Delete all deployments.
3. Switch your account to the community plan.
4. Delete your company.

[NOTE.note]
====
FusionAuth requires that customers delete their own deployments using the account portal.

FusionAuth is **not able** to cancel accounts with deployments that could potentially contain critical user data.
====

To remove your deployments, please https://account.fusionauth.io/account/deployment/[log into your account and navigate to your deployments]. Once you see your deployment, you can click the [uielement]#Action# button and select [uielement]#Delete#. After a deployment is destroyed, you won't be charged going forward for this instance going forward. Any previous usage outside of a free trial will be billed.

Then, https://account.fusionauth.io/account/plan/[switch your plan type to the community plan]. After the current billing cycle is done, you won't be charged; plans are billed monthly. 

After deleting your deployments and changing your plan, your account will not be charged after the current billing cycle, unless you start up another instance or change your plan to something else. It is inactive and can be deleted if you desire.

It is perfectly acceptable to leave your account in this condition, especially in the case where you may be doing future work with FusionAuth. However, if data practices or company policies mandate, you may also remove your account from FusionAuth Cloud. Removing a company and its data is not reversible. To delete the company, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Company -> Danger Zone# and follow the instructions there.

If you cannot delete the company following these instructions, you may have an account which requires FusionAuth team assistance. This occurs if your FusionAuth plan is invoiced, for example.

In this case, please contact your account team for further instructions. A support ticket may also be required to remove your company.
