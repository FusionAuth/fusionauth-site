This form is what you see when you are adding or editing a user in the admin UI. This is configurable at the Tenant level.

If you need capture and validate custom data, you can do so by creating a form field, by navigating to [breadcrumb]#Customizations -> Form Fields#. You should create any needed fields before you create a form. Otherwise you can use the standard form fields.

Create a form, by navigating to [breadcrumb]#Customizations -> Forms#. Select [uielement]#Admin User# as the type. Add the needed sections and fields.

Configure the FusionAuth admin UI to use these forms by navigating to [breadcrumb]#Tenants -> Your Tenant -> General# and then to the [breadcrumb]#Form settings# section. Set the [field]#Admin user form# field to your new form.
