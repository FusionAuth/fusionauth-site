You might be wondering, what is the difference between multi-factor authentication (MFA) and two factor authentication (2FA)? First, a factor is anything a user has, is or provides which proves who they are. The end goal of authentication, after all, is to be assured that whoever is behind a request is who they say they are.

When a system can support more than one method of authentication, it supports MFA. For example, FusionAuth supports a code sent to a phone or email and a time-based one-time password (TOTP) based on a shared secret stored in Google Authenticator or another similar application.

2FA typically occurs when a user provides two factors at the moment of login. In FusionAuth, one of those factors will always be a password.
