You cannot filter search results in FusionAuth to only return certain fields. Instead you must do this through post-processing. So if you want to retrieve only the `firstName` and `birthDate` fields of a set of users, the results will give you each entire user object and you must select desired fields. You can use the JSON processing facilities in your chosen language to do so, or use a tool such as https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[`jq`].

When using the Elasticsearch search engine, the maximum number of users returned for any search is 10000 users. There is an https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/494[open bug] tracking this issue.
