You often need to paginate the results when running a query that matches many users or entities. 

You can use the `numberOfResults` and `startRow` parameters to do so.

[source,javascript,title="Pagination pseudocode to retrieve search results"]
----

// this is pseudo code and won't work out of the box
// adapt for whichever client and programming language you are using

startRow = 0
numberOfResults = 25
fullresults = [] // new array
results = client.search(query, startRow, numberOfResults)
count = results.length
fullresults.append(results)

while (count > 0) {
  startRow = startRow + count 
  results = client.search(query, startRow, numberOfResults)
  fullresults.append(results)
  count = results.length
}

// process fullresults here
----

You may also set `numberOfResults` to a higher number (500 or 5000, for example) to retrieve more results.
However, processing results 25 or 50 at a time has less impact on the FusionAuth system.
