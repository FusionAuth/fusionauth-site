== Messengers

Currently, messengers allow a user to send a message within FusionAuth. They can be customized using link:/docs/v1/tech/themes/[themes].

== Setup a Messenger

In FusionAuth, you can set up three types of messengers

- link:twilio-messenger[Setup a Twilio Messenger]
- link:kafka-messenger[Setup a Kafka Messenger]
- link:generic-messenger[Setup a Generic Messenger]

== Create a Messenger Template

Message templates are a powerful way to customize messengers and the communication contained within. FusionAuth uses FreeMarker for all templating.
