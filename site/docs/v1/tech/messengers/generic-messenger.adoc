== Set Up a Generic Messenger

Currently the only supported transport for a messenger is SMS. If you need to connect to a SMS provider other than Twilio, you can use Generic messenger configuration.

The generic messenger allows for a simple JSON REST API integration which allows you to receive a message from FusionAuth and then make an API call to any third party SMS provider you wish.
