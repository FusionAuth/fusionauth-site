Applications are anything that a user can log in to. In FusionAuth there's no differentiation between web applications, SaaS applications, APIs and native apps. To add an application, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Applications# and choose the green plus sign. Give the application a descriptive name like `{migration_source_name} application`.

Navigate to the [breadcrumb]#OAuth# tab and add an entry to [field]#Authorized redirect URLs#. Use a testing value such as `\https://fusionauth.io`. Later, you'll need to update this to be a valid redirect URL to code which can take the authorization code and exchange it for a token. Learn more about this in the link:/docs/v1/tech/oauth/[FusionAuth OAuth documentation].

You shouldn't need to modify any of the other configuration options to test importing users. Save the application.

Next, view the application by clicking the green magnifying glass and note the [field]#OAuth IdP login URL#. You'll be using it to test that users can log in.
