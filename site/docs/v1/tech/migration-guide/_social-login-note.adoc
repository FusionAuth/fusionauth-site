{migration_source_name} also provides integrations with other social login providers such as Twitter, Google or Facebook. Review the supported FusionAuth link:/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers/[Identity Providers] to ensure your social providers are supported. 

If not listed explicitly, they may work with an OIDC or SAML connection. Otherwise, please open a https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-issues/[feature request].

TODO
When migrating social logins, you may need to modify the switches of the {migration_source_name} import script. See <<Use the Script>> for more.
