Next, log in to the FusionAuth administrative user interface. Review the user entries to ensure the data was correctly imported.

You can manage the user by clicking on the [uielement]#Manage# button (black button) to the right of the [uielement]#Created# date in the list to review the details of the imported user's profile.

ifeval::["{migration_source_dir}" != "cognito"]
If you have a test user whose password you know, open an incognito window and log in to ensure the hash migration was successful. You recorded the URL to log in to the example application in <<Create a Test Application>>.

After the test login, the user will be redirected to a URL like `\https://fusionauth.io/?code=FlZF97WIYLNxt4SGD_22qvpRh4fZ6kg_N89ZbBAy1E4&locale=fr&userState=Authenticated`. This happens because you haven't set up a web application to handle the authorization code redirect.

That is an important next step but is beyond the scope of this document. Consult the link:/docs/v1/tech/5-minute-setup-guide[5 minute setup guide] for an example of how to do this.
