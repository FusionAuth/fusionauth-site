You now have your users migrated, or a plan to do so. Congratulations! What is next?

You need to migrate additional configuration, as mentioned in <<Other Entities>>. Since the type of configuration varies, it is hard to provide a full list of how to import these items, but the general pattern will be:

* Identify corresponding FusionAuth functionality.
* Configure it in your FusionAuth instance, either manually or by scripting it using the link:/docs/v1/tech/client-libraries/[client libraries] or link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/[API].
* Update your application configuration to use the new FusionAuth functionality.

Make sure you assign your users to the appropriate FusionAuth applications. You can do this either:

* As part of your import process by adding registrations at import time.
* After users have been migrated with the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/registrations[Registrations API].

You'll also need to modify and test each of your applications, whether custom, open source, or commercial, to ensure:

* Users can successfully log in.
* The authorization code redirect is handled correctly.
* Users receive appropriate permissions and roles based on the JWT.
* The look and feel of the hosted login pages matches each application's look and feel.

If your application uses a standard OAuth, SAML or OIDC library to communicate with {migration_source_name}, the transition should be relatively painless.
