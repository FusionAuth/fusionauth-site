The attributes of the User object in FusionAuth are link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/users[well documented]. 

If there is an attribute in your {migration_source_name} user which cannot be directly mapped to a FusionAuth attribute, you can place it in the `user.data` field. This field can store arbitrary JSON values and will be indexed and searchable.
