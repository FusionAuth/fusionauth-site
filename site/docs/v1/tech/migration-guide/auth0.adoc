== Overview

This document will help you migrate off of Auth0. If you are looking to compare FusionAuth and Auth0, link:/blog/2018/10/19/auth0-and-fusionauth-a-tale-of-two-solutions[this document may help].

This guide assumes you have installed FusionAuth. If you have not, please link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/[view our installation guides] and install FusionAuth before you begin. For more general migration information, please view the link:/docs/v1/tech/migration-guide/general[FusionAuth migration guide].

There are a number of different ways applications can be integrated with Auth0, and it would be difficult to cover them all. This guide mentions the typical parts of a bulk migration and focuses on migrating user data from an Auth0 managed user database into FusionAuth. 

== Planning Considerations

=== Obtaining User Data

You can use either the Auth0 management API or the Auth0 user interface to export user data. This guide uses the user interface, but if you have a large number of users, the https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Users/get_users[management API is recommended]. Auth0 also has a https://auth0.com/docs/support/export-data[high level export guide] worth reviewing.

If you are using the user interface, usernames, email addresses and other data can be obtained by installing an extension and downloading the data. The password hashes can be obtained by opening a support ticket.

Here's a brief video walking through the export process, which is further documented below.

=== Mapping User Attributes

include::docs/v1/tech/migration-guide/_mapping-user-attributes.adoc[]

=== Social Logins

include::docs/v1/tech/migration-guide/_social-login-note.adoc[]

include::docs/v1/tech/migration-guide/_social-login-migration.adoc[]

=== Other Entities

:other_migrated_entities: connections or roles
include::docs/v1/tech/migration-guide/_other-entities-intro.adoc[]
:other_migrated_entities!:

* In Auth0, https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders[Connections] are a source of data for users. FusionAuth calls these link:/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers/[Identity Providers].
* https://auth0.com/docs/rules[Rules], https://auth0.com/docs/hooks[Hooks] and https://auth0.com/docs/actions[Actions] are ways for you to customize authentication or authorization workflows. FusionAuth has a similar concept called link:/docs/v1/tech/lambdas/[Lambdas].
* With Auth0, https://auth0.com/docs/applications/set-up-an-application[APIs, Applications and SSO Integrations] are what your users can log in to. They are also called Clients in the Auth0 documentation. FusionAuth refers to these as link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/applications[Applications]. 
* https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/learn-the-basics[Tenants] are a high level construct which groups other entities such as users and applications together. FusionAuth calls these link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/tenants[Tenants] as well. FusionAuth supports multi-tenant configuration by default.
* For Auth0, https://auth0.com/docs/authorization/rbac/roles[Roles and Permissions] provide information about what your users can do in your custom or off the shelf applications. FusionAuth has link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/roles[Roles] and they are defined on an Application by Application basis.
* Refresh tokens allow JWTs to be refreshed without a user logging in. These can be migrated using the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/users#import-refresh-tokens[Import Refresh Tokens API].

[NOTE]
====
In FusionAuth, users are explicitly mapped to applications with a link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/registrations[Registration]. 

Auth0, in contrast, gives users access to all Auth0 applications in a tenant by default. 
====

==== Identifiers 

include::docs/v1/tech/migration-guide/_identifiers.adoc[]

=== Embedded Login

Auth0 provides https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/embedded-login[Embedded Login]. This is a complex, configurable login component that works with SPAs, native applications and web applications. It is also not recommended by Auth0:

> https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/embedded-login["We do not recommend using Embedded Login."]

FusionAuth's login experience is simpler. You can choose to build your own login pages or use FusionAuth's hosted login pages. link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/integration-points#login-options[Read more about these choices].

FusionAuth's hosted login pages are very similar to https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login[Auth0's Universal Login].

You can build an experience similar to Auth0's Embedded Login using the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/login[FusionAuth Login API], but FusionAuth does not offer any widgets or SDKs that use that API.

Once you've planned your migration, the next step is to export your user data from Auth0.

== Exporting Users

To export users with the user interface, log in and navigate to your dashboard. You'll perform the following steps:

1. Add the User Import/Export extension, if not present
2. Run the extension
3. Download the exported file

=== Add the Extension

Auth0 provides an extension that allows you to both import and export users to and from Auth0. Add the extension by navigating to [breadcrumb]#Extensions# and searching for it.

image::migration-guide/auth0/find-user-export-extension.png[Finding the import/export extension.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

After you find the extension, install it:

image::migration-guide/auth0/user-export-extension-install.png[Installing the import/export extension.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

The next step is to run the extension. 

=== Run the Extension

Next, run the extension. The first time you run it, you'll be asked to grant needed permissions. Then, choose the export tab. 

This will bring up a screen with information such as what fields you want to export, which connections to pull users from, and the export file format.

image::migration-guide/auth0/user-export-extension-export-run.png[Running the import/export extension.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

For this guide, export user information as JSON. Choose the default user database. Finally, if you have special fields to include, configure their export as needed. Then begin the export.

image::migration-guide/auth0/auth0-export-complete.png[View when the the import/export extension is finished.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Depending on how many users you have in your database, it may take a while for this to complete.

=== Download the File

After the export finishes, download the file provided. At the end of the process, you'll end up with a JSON file like this:

[source,json,title=Sample Auth0 user data export download]
----
{"user_id":"auth0|60425da93519d90068f82966","email":"test@example.com","name":"test@example.com","nickname":"test","created_at":"2021-03-05T16:34:49.518Z","updated_at":"2021-03-05T16:34:49.518Z","email_verified":false}
{"user_id":"auth0|60425dc43519d90068f82973","email":"test2@example.com","name":"test2@example.com","nickname":"test2","created_at":"2021-03-05T16:35:16.786Z","updated_at":"2021-03-05T16:35:16.786Z","email_verified":false}
----

This is half of the data you'll need to migrate your users. The other half is the password hashes. 

== Exporting Password Hashes

Because password hashes are considered sensitive information, Auth0 does not export them as part of the general export process. You must file a support ticket to get the hashes and other password related information.

include::docs/v1/tech/migration-guide/_password-hash-note.adoc[]

However, once you've exported the password hashes from Auth0 and imported them into FusionAuth, your users will be able to log in to FusionAuth with the same password they used previously. 

If you are not able to export the hashes, due to the plan you are on or the migration timelines, one alternative is to have every user change their password using the forgot password flow. You can still import all the user data.

To start the process of obtaining the hashes, open a support ticket. From your dashboard, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Get Support#, and then open a ticket by scrolling to the bottom of the support page. 

image::migration-guide/auth0/create-ticket-start.png[The first step to getting your password hashes.,width=1200,role=top-cropped]

Select the issue and details of your request. Choose `I have a question regarding my Auth0 account` and then pick the `I would like to obtain an export of my password hashes` option.

You'll receive an automated message after this ticket is submitted. View progress on the ticket screen. 

[NOTE]
====
Auth0 requires you to be on a link:https://auth0.com/docs/support/export-data[paid plan] to export your password hashes. You cannot export them otherwise.

Additionally, Auth0 makes no commitments about the processing time for a password hash request. In the author's experience, it took approximately one week.

Plan accordingly. 
====

After your request is processed, you'll download a JSON file containing password hashes, related information and user ids. It will look like this:

[source,json,title=Sample Auth0 password hash export download]
----
{"_id":{"$oid":"60425dc43519d90068f82973"},"email_verified":false,"email":"test2@example.com","passwordHash":"$2b$10$Z6hUTEEeoJXN5/AmSm/4.eZ75RYgFVriQM9LPhNEC7kbAbS/VAaJ2","password_set_date":{"$date":"2021-03-05T16:35:16.775Z"},"tenant":"dev-rwsbs6ym","connection":"Username-Password-Authentication","_tmp_is_unique":true}
{"_id":{"$oid":"60425da93519d90068f82966"},"email_verified":false,"email":"test@example.com","passwordHash":"$2b$10$CSZ2JarG4XYbGa.JkfpqnO2wrlbfp5eb5LScHSGo9XGeZ.a.Ic54S","password_set_date":{"$date":"2021-03-05T16:34:49.502Z"},"tenant":"dev-rwsbs6ym","connection":"Username-Password-Authentication","_tmp_is_unique":true}
----

Now that you have both the user data and the password hashes, you can import your users.

== Importing Users

Next up, import the user data. Here are the steps we need to take.

1. Set Up FusionAuth
2. Get the Script
3. Install Needed Gems
4. Use the Script
5. Verify the Import
6. The Final Destination of Imported Users

=== Set Up FusionAuth

include::docs/v1/tech/migration-guide/_set-up-fusionauth.adoc[]

==== Create a Test Tenant

include::docs/v1/tech/migration-guide/_create-test-tenant.adoc[]

==== Create a Test Application

include::docs/v1/tech/migration-guide/_create-test-application.adoc[]

==== Add an API Key

include::docs/v1/tech/migration-guide/_create-api-key-social.adoc[]

=== Get the Script

include::docs/v1/tech/migration-guide/_get-script.adoc[]

=== Install Needed Gems

The following gems must be available to the import script:

* `date`
* `json`
* `optargs`
* `securerandom`
* `fusionauth_client`

Most likely all of these will be on your system already, except the `fusionauth_client` gem.

If you have `bundler` installed, run `bundle install` in the `auth0` directory. Otherwise install the needed gems in some other way.

=== Use the Script

You can see the output of the script by running it with the `-h` option:

[source,sh,title=Running the import script with the help command line switch]
----
ruby ./import.rb -h
----

The output will be similar to this:

[source,sh,title=The help output of the import.rb script]
----
Usage: import.rb [options]
    -l, --link-social-accounts       Link social accounts, if present, after import. This operation is slower than an import.
    -r APPLICATION_IDS,              A comma separated list of existing applications Ids. All users will be registered for these applications.
        --register-users
    -o, --only-link-social-accounts  Link social accounts with no import.
    -u, --users-file USERS_FILE      The exported JSON user data file from Auth0. Defaults to users.json.
    -f FUSIONAUTH_URL,               The location of the FusionAuth instance. Defaults to http://localhost:9011.
        --fusionauth-url
    -k, --fusionauth-api-key API_KEY The FusionAuth API key.
    -t TENANT_ID,                    The FusionAuth tenant id. Required if more than one tenant exists.
        --fusionauth-tenant-id
    -s, --secrets-file SECRETS_FILE  The exported JSON secrets file from Auth0. Defaults to secrets.json.
    -m, --map-auth0-id               Whether to map the auth0 id for normal imported users to the FusionAuth user id.
    -h, --help                       Prints this help.
----

For this script to work correctly, set the following switches, unless the defaults work for you:

* `-u` should point to the location of the user export file you obtained, unless the default works.
* `-s` needs to point to the location of the password hash export file you received, unless the default works.
* `-f` must point to your FusionAuth instance. If you are testing locally, it will probably be `\http://localhost:9011`.
* `-k` needs to be set to the value of the API key created above.
* `-t` should be set to the Id of the testing tenant created above.

The `-o` and `-l` switches will attempt to create links for any social users (where the user authenticated via Google or another social provider) found in the users data file.

If you are loading social users, you must create the social providers in FusionAuth beforehand, or the links will fail. Additionally, creating a link is not currently optimized in the same way that loading users is. So it may make sense to import all the users in one pass (omitting the `-l` switch). Then, after the users are imported, create the links using the `-o` switch in a second pass.

[NOTE.note]
====
The social account linking functionality will only work with FusionAuth versions above or equal to 1.28. The `fusionauth_client` library must be >= 1.28 as well.
====

You may or may not want to use the `-m` switch, which takes the Auth0 Id for users without a social login and uses the same value for the FusionAuth user Id. If you have external systems reliant on the Auth0 user identifier, set this. Doing so ensures imported users have the same Id as they did in Auth0. Otherwise, you can omit this switch.

When you run the script, you'll see output like:

[source,shell,title=Import script output]
----
$ ruby ./import.rb -f http://localhost:9011 -k '...' -s secrets.json -u user-data.json
FusionAuth Importer : Auth0
 > User file: user-data.json
 > User secrets file: secrets.json
 > Call FusionAuth to import users
 > Import success
Duplicate users 0
Import complete. 2 users imported.
----

==== Enhancing the Script

You may also want to migrate additional data. Currently, the following attributes are migrated:

* `user_id`
* `email`
* `email_verified`
* `username`
* `insertInstant`
* the password hash and supporting attributes, if available
* `registrations`, if supplied

The migrated user will have the Auth0 tenant Id and original user Id stored on the `user.data` object. If you have additional user attributes to migrate, review and modify the `map_user` method. 

You may also want to assign Roles, or associate users with Groups, by creating the appropriate JSON data structures in the import call. These are documented in the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/users#import-users[Import User API docs]. This will require modifying the `import.rb` code.

=== Verify the Import

include::docs/v1/tech/migration-guide/_verify-import.adoc[]

=== The Final Destination of Imported Users

include::docs/v1/tech/migration-guide/_final-destination.adoc[]

== MFA Enrollments

Your users may have MFA enabled.
If so, you will want to port that over.

The first thing to do is to look at the MFA methods available to your users.
Here's https://auth0.com/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication-factors[the list of Auth0 supported factors].
You may not have enabled all of these.
Here's https://auth0.com/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/enable-mfa[Auth0 documentation] to see which you've enabled in the dashboard.

The [field]#method# field of the Two-Factor API link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/two-factor#request-body[lists the MFA methods supported by FusionAuth].
FusionAuth also supports recovery codes.

You can determine which type of MFA is used by each user by retrieving https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Users/get_users_by_id[their data using the management API].

If a user uses email or SMS verification, you can port the data over to FusionAuth using link:/docs/v1/tech/guides/multi-factor-authentication#directly-enabling-mfa-for-a-user[the user update API] or by adding the [field]#twoFactor# fields to your import JSON.
The former will link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/users#what-makes-a-user-active[trigger an MAU increment], while the latter will not.

While you can't generate a fixed set of recovery codes, once MFA has been enabled for a user, you can link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/two-factor#retrieve-recovery-codes[retrieve the recovery codes].

If your user uses TOTP, where they provide a one time code provided by an application like Google Authenticator, you'll need to request the initial secret for your users from Auth0 by opening a support ticket with them.

If your users use a different method unsupported by FusionAuth, then you should map the Auth0 method to a FusionAuth method.

* WebAuthn: https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/77[Follow this issue to see the status of FusionAuth WebAuthn support].
* Push Notifications: It is possible a link:/docs/v1/tech/messengers/generic-messenger[Generic Messenger] would work, but this would require some investigation and custom coding.
* Voice: A link:/docs/v1/tech/messengers/generic-messenger[Generic Messenger] integrated with a solution like https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice[Twilio Voice] should work.
* Cisco Duo: A link:/docs/v1/tech/messengers/generic-messenger[Generic Messenger] integrated with a solution like https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice[Twilio Voice] could work.
