The next step is to create an API key. This will be used by the import script. To do so, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> API Keys# in the administrative user interface.

This key needs to have the permission to run a bulk import of users. In the spirit of the principle of least privilege, give it only the following permissions:

 * `POST` to the `/api/user/import` endpoint.
 * `POST` to the `/api/user/search` endpoint.
 * `POST` to the `/api/identity-provider/link` endpoint.

{extra_permissions_text}

Record the API key string, as you'll use it below.
