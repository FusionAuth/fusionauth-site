The current status of the username. This is used if you are moderating usernames via CleanSpeak. The possible values are:
+
    * `ACTIVE` - the username is active
    * `PENDING` - the username is pending approval/moderation
    * `REJECTED` - the username was rejected during moderation
+
If a username has been rejected, it is still possible to allow the User to update it and have the new one moderated again.
