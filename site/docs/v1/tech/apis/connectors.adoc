== Create a Connector

This API is used to create a new Connector.

=== Request

link:authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[role=red,type=fas]] Create a Connector with a randomly generated Id
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#POST# [uri]#/api/connector#

[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#POST# [uri]#/api/connector/`\{connectorId\}`#
--

==== Request Parameters

[.api]
[field]#connectorId# [type]#[UUID]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to secure random UUID#::
The Id to use for the new Connector. If not specified a secure random UUID will be generated.

== Retrieve a Connector

This API is used to retrieve a single Connector by unique Id or all of the configured Connectors.

=== Request

[.api-authentication]
link:authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[role=red,type=fas]] Retrieve all of the Connectors
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#GET# [uri]#/api/group#
--

include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_x-fusionauth-tenant-id-header-scoped-operation.adoc[]

[.api-authentication]
link:authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[role=red,type=fas]] Retrieve a Connector by Id
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#GET# [uri]#/api/group/`\{groupId\}`#
--

==== Request Parameters

[.api]
[field]#groupId# [type]#[UUID]# [required]#Required#::
The unique Id of the Connector to retrieve.

include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_x-fusionauth-tenant-id-header-scoped-operation.adoc[]

=== Response

The response for this API contains either a single Connector or all of the Connectors. When you call this API with an Id the response will contain a single Connector. When you call this API without an Id the response will contain all of the Connectors. Both response types are defined below along with an example JSON response.

== Update a Connector

This API is used to update an existing Connector. You must specify the Id of the Connector you are updating on the URI.

You must specify all of the properties of the Connector when calling this API with the `PUT` HTTP method. This API does not merge the existing Connector and your new data. It replaces the existing Connector with your new data.

Utilize the `PATCH` HTTP method to send only the changes to merge into an existing Connector.

=== Request

[.api-authentication]
link:authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[role=red,type=fas]] Update the Connector with the given Id
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#PUT# [uri]#/api/group/`\{groupId\}`#
--

:api_endpoint: pass:normal[/api/group/`\{groupId\}`]
include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_patch-support.adoc[]

==== Request Parameters

[.api]
[field]#groupId# [type]#[UUID]# [required]#Required#::
The Id of the Connector to update.

include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_x-fusionauth-tenant-id-header-scoped-operation.adoc[]

include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_group-request-body.adoc[]

=== Response

The response for this API contains the Connector that was updated.

:response_body_title: Response Body
include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_group-response-body.adoc[]


== Delete a Connector

This API is used to permanently delete a Connector. Deleting a Connector that has Application Roles will effectively modify User Registrations by removing these Roles from Connector members.

=== Request

[.api-authentication]
link:authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[role=red,type=fas]] Delete a Connector by Id
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#DELETE# [uri]#/api/group/`\{groupId\}`#
--

==== Request Parameters

[.api]
[field]#groupId# [type]#[UUID]# [required]#Required#::
The unique Id of the Connector to delete.

include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_x-fusionauth-tenant-id-header-scoped-operation.adoc[]

=== Response

This API does not return a JSON response body.

include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_standard-delete-response-codes.adoc[]

== Add Users to a Connector

This API is used to add Users to a Connector. A User that is added to a Connector is called a member, a user can belong to one to many Connectors.

Adding a User to a Connector can be used to logically group users, Connector members can be returned by the Search API by searching by the Connector Id. Application Roles may also be managed by a Connector membership. When a User becomes a member of a Connector they will inherit the Application Roles assigned to the Connector for their registered Applications. If a User is not registered for an Application the Application Roles for that Application will not be applied to the User.

=== Request

[.api-authentication]
link:authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[role=red,type=fas]] Add Users to Connector
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#POST# [uri]#/api/group/member#
--

=== Response

include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_member-response-body.adoc[]


== Remove Users from a Connector

This API is used to remove Users from a Connector. Removing a User from a Connector removes their Connector membership. Removing a User from a Connector effectively modifies their assigned Roles if Application Roles are being managed through the Connector membership.

=== Request

[.api-authentication]
link:authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[role=red,type=fas]] Remove a single User from a Connector by Member Id
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#DELETE# [uri]#/api/group/member/`\{memberId\}`#
--

==== Request Parameters

[.api]
[field]#memberId# [type]#[UUID]# [required]#Required#::
The unique Id of the Connector Member to delete.

[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#DELETE# [uri]#/api/group/member``?groupId={groupId}&userId={userId}``#
--

==== Request Parameters

[.api]
[field]#groupId# [type]#[UUID]# [required]#Required#::
