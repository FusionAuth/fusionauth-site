[WARNING]

This API is in technical preview and is subject to change.

A FusionAuth Consent is a definition of a permission that can be given to a User. At a minimum a consent has a name, and defines the minimum age of self-consent. A consent can then be granted to a User from a family member or optionally a User may self-consent if they meet the minimum age defined by the consent.

The first API allows you to create, delete, update and retrieve a consent. The FusionAuth Consent is the object that defines the consent, the values, minimum ages, etc.

The second API is the User Consent API, this API allows you to grant a User Consent, and update a User Consent. In order to revoke a User Consent you simply need to update the consent status.
