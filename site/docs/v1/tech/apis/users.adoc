== Delete a User

This API is used to delete a User. You must specify the Id of the User on the URI. You can also specify whether or not the User is soft or hard deleted. A soft delete deactivates the User. A hard delete permanently deletes a User's data.

Soft deleted users are marked as inactive but not deleted from FusionAuth. Deactivated users have their data retained but they are unable to authenticate. Users who have been deactivated can be reactivated; see <<Reactivate a User>> for more.

The data of a User who has been hard deleted is permanently removed from FusionAuth. The User's data cannot be restored via the FusionAuth API or the administrative user interface. If you need to restore the User's data, you must retrieve it from a database backup.

==== Request Parameters

[.api]
[field]#dryRun# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `false`#::
To preview the user Ids to be deleted by the request without applying the requested action set this value to `true`.

[field]#hardDelete# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `false`#::
To Permanently delete a user from FusionAuth set this value to `true`. Once a user has been permanently deleted, the action cannot be undone. When this value is set to `false` the user is marked as inactive and the user will be unable log into FusionAuth. This action may be undone by reactivating the user.

[field]#query# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional# [since]#Available since 1.13.0#::
The raw JSON Elasticsearch query that is used to search for Users. The [field]#userId#, [field]#query#, and [field]#queryString#  parameters are mutually exclusive, they are listed here in order of precedence.
+
It is necessary to use the [field]#query# parameter when querying against `registrations` in order to achieve expected results, as this field is defined as a link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.3/nested.html[nested datatype] in the Elasticsearch mapping.
+
[NOTE]
====
*Database search engine*

This parameter is not compatible with the database search engine, it may only be used when Elasticsearch is configured as the user search engine.
====

[field]#queryString# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional# [since]#Available since 1.13.0#::
The Elasticsearch query string that is used to search for Users to be deleted. The [field]#userId#, [field]#query#, and [field]#queryString#  parameters are mutually exclusive, they are listed here in order of precedence.
+
[NOTE]
====
*Database search engine*

The Elasticsearch query string DSL is not supported for the database search engine.  Database search limits effective queries to single search terms that may match the following fields on the User:

* `firstName`
* `lastName`
* `fullName`
* `email`
* `username`

The following is an example bulk delete request with a `queryString` value that is compatible with the database search engine:

``DELETE /api/user/bulk?queryString=jared%40fusionauth.io``
====

[field]#userId# [type]#[UUID]# [optional]#Optional#::
The Id of the User to delete. Repeat this parameter for each user to be deleted. The [field]#userId#, [field]#query#, and [field]#queryString#  parameters are mutually exclusive, they are listed here in order of precedence.

:never_missing!:


== Search for Users

This API is used to search for Users. This API may be called using the `GET` or `POST` HTTP methods, examples of each are provided below. The `POST` method is provided to allow for a richer request object without worrying about exceeding the maximum length of a URL. Calling this API with either the `GET` or `POST` HTTP method will will provide the same search results given the same query parameters.

=== Request

Which search query parameters are available and how they behave depends on the search engine type. Read more about link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/users#user-search[the different types of search engines].

=== Database Search Engine

This is a good choice for link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/users#database-search-engine[smaller installs, embedded scenarios, or other places where the additional capability of Elasticsearch is not required].

== Flush the Search Engine

This API is used to issue a flush request to the FusionAuth Search. This will cause any cached data to be written to disk. In practice it is unlikely
 you'll find a need for this API in production unless you are performing search requests immediately following an operation that modifies the index and
  expecting to see the results immediately.

=== Request

[.api-authentication]

[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#PUT# [uri]#/api/user/search#

=== Response

The response does not contain a body. It only contains one of the status codes below.

include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_standard-post-response-codes.adoc[]


== Retrieve Recent Logins

[NOTE.since]
====
Available Since Version 1.4.0
====

This API is used to retrieve recent logins.

=== Request

[.api-authentication]
link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[type=fas]] Retrieve recent logins
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#GET# [uri]#/api/user/recent-login``?limit=\{limit\}&offset=\{offset\}&userId=\{userId\}``#
--

==== Request Parameters

[.api]
[field]#limit# [type]#[Integer]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `10`#::
This parameter indicates the maximum amount of logins to return for a single request.

[field]#offset# [type]#[Integer]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `0`#::
This parameter provides the offset into the result set. Generally speaking if you wish to paginate the results, you will increment this parameter on subsequent API request by the size of the `limit` parameter.

[field]#userId# [type]#[UUID]# [optional]#Optional#::
This parameter will narrow the results to only logins for a particular user. When this parameter is omitted, the most recent logins for all of FusionAuth will be returned.

include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_x-fusionauth-tenant-id-header-scoped-operation.adoc[]

=== Response

The response will contain recent logins containing no more than the value set by the `limit` parameter. By design, this API does not return the total number of results and only lets paginate through the results from newest to oldest.

== Start Forgot Password Workflow

This API is used to start the forgot password workflow for a single User.

For example, on your login form you may have a button for _Forgot your password_. This would be the API you would call to initiate the request for the user. If the email configuration is complete, the user will be sent the forgot password email containing a link containing the `changePasswordId`. The provided link should take the user to a form that allows them to change their password. This form should contain a hidden field for the `changePasswordId` generated by this API.

By default the `changePasswordId` is valid to be used with the link:#change-a-users-password[Change Password] API for 10 minutes. If a `404` is returned when using this Id to change the password, the workflow
will need to be started again to generate a new identifier. This duration can be modified using the Tenant API or in the FusionAuth UI.

You may optionally authenticate this request with an API key to allow for some additional request parameters and the generated `changePasswordId` will be returned in the JSON body. This may be helpful if you wish to use your own email system or you have an alternative method to call the link:#change-a-users-password[Change Password] API.

[NOTE]
====
If FusionAuth sends an email to the user, it will either use the `email` top level property on the user or it will use a custom data attribute named `email` as well (i.e. `data.email`). This allows you to have a user that has no email address for login or allow distinct users to share email addresses.

== Change a User's Password

This API is used to change the User's password.

This API may be used as the second part of the Forgot Password workflow. For example, after the User is sent an email that contains a link to a web form that allows them to update their password you will call this API with the `changePasswordId` and their updated password. If the `changePasswordId` is valid then the User's password will be updated.

This API may also be used separately from the Forgot Password workflow by omitting the `changePasswordId` and using the `loginId` instead.

By default the `changePasswordId` is valid for 10 minutes after it was generated. If a `404` is returned when using the change password Id, the workflow will need to be started again to generate a new identifier. This duration can be modified using the System Configuration API or in the FusionAuth UI.


[NOTE]
====
When this API successfully completes, all refresh tokens and outstanding Change Password Ids (i.e. `changePasswordId`) currently assigned to the user will be expired or revoked. This means
that if a user is using a refresh token they will be forced to re-authenticate with their new password.
====


=== Request

[.api-authentication]
link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication#no-authentication-required[icon:unlock-alt[role=green, title="No authentication required"]] Changes a User's password using the change password Id.

This usage is generally intended to be part of an email workflow and does not require authentication. The `changePasswordId` used on this API request will have been previously generated by the Start Forgot Password API or by using the Forgot Password workflow on the FusionAuth login page.

link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication#jwt-authentication[icon:id-badge[type=fas]] Changes a User's password using a JWT

[NOTE.since]
====
Available Since Version 1.5.0
====

This API will use a JWT as authentication. See link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication#jwt-authentication[JWT Authentication] for examples of how you can send the JWT to FusionAuth.

A common use case for using this API with a JWT will be if you want to allow the user to change their own password. Specifically if you are attempting to perform this request in a frontend  browser that cannot store an API key.

Because changing a User's password will revoke all existing refresh tokens if you allow the user to change their password they will need to re-authenticate to stay logged into your application if you are utilizing JWTs and Refresh Tokens.

For this reason, this API will return a `oneTimePassword` that is intended to be used programatically after a Change Password request completes to keep the user logged in and provide a better user experience. A successful login will return you a new access token (JWT) and a refresh token. This will allow you to make the change password workflow seamless to the user.

==== Request Body

[.api]
[field]#currentPassword# [type]#[String]# [required]#Required#::
The User's current password. This is required when using a JWT to change your password.

[field]#password# [type]#[String]# [required]#Required#::
The User's new password.

[field]#refreshToken# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#::
The user's existing refresh token. If you have access to your current refresh token, it can be provided in the request body using this parameter. If the `refresh_token` cookie also exists and is present on the request it will take precedence over this parameter.
+
This parameter is used to determine if the `oneTimePassword` that is returned from this API will be eligible to request a refresh token when used by the Login API. If this parameter is not provided and no cookie is found on the request, a refresh token will not be provided on the Login response when using the returned `oneTimePassword`.
