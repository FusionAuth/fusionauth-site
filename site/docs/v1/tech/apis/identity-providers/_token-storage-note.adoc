FusionAuth will also store the {idp_display_name} {token_name} returned from the {return_text} in the `identityProviderLink` object. This object is accessible using the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/identity-providers/links[Link API].

The `identityProviderLink` object stores tokens so that you can use them in your application to call {idp_display_name} APIs on behalf of the user if desired.

[NOTE.note]

Prior to version 1.28, the {token_name} was stored in the `UserRegistration` object, in the `tokens` Map.
