This API allows you to complete a {idp_display_name} login after authenticating a user using the {idp_display_name} API. If you are using the FusionAuth login UI with the {idp_display_name} button you will not utilize this API directly.

This API is intended to be used if you want to build your own login page and you have added the {idp_display_name} login button to your own login page and you then need to complete the login with FusionAuth.

ifeval::["{idp_display_name}" != "HYPR"]
For example, if you built your own login page, you could add a "Login with {idp_display_name}" button and complete the {idp_display_name} authentication. When you complete the {idp_display_name} authentication you will have been returned {token_text_with_article} from {idp_display_name}. Using this API you can pass that {token_text} to FusionAuth and we will complete the login workflow and reconcile the user to FusionAuth.

The user does not need to exist yet in FusionAuth to utilize this API, depending on the configured link:/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers/#linking-strategies[linking strategy]. The {token_text} returned from {idp_display_name} will be used to retrieve the user's email address or username and if that user does not yet exist in FusionAuth the user may be created.

endif::[]

ifeval::["{idp_display_name}" == "HYPR"]
The user does not need to exist yet in FusionAuth to utilize this API. If a user with the email address used to initiate the request with HYPR does not yet exist in FusionAuth the user will be created.

endif::[]

If [field]#createRegistration# has been enabled for this identity provider and the user does not yet have a registration for this application, a registration will be automatically created for the user. The user will be assigned any default roles configured for the application.

If [field]#createRegistration# has not been enabled, a registration will not be created if one does not yet exist. This is useful if you wish to manually provision users and then subsequently allow them to login with {idp_display_name}.
