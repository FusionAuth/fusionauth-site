== Overview

[NOTE.since]
====
This API has been available since 1.28.0
====

The Epic Games identity provider type will use the Epic Games OAuth login API. It will also provide a `Login with Epic Games` button on FusionAuth’s login page that will direct a user to the Epic Games login page.

This identity provider will call Epic Games' API to load the Epic Games user's `displayName` and use that as `username` to lookup or create a user in FusionAuth depending on the linking strategy configured for this identity provider.  However, Epic Games does not allow access to user emails, so neither email linking strategy can be used and user’s will not be able to login or be created.
