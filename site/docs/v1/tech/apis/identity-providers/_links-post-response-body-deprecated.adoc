==== Response Body

[.api]
[field]#displayName# [type]#[String]#::
A human readable name for this link for identification and convenience. This value will generally be an email address, or username. This value can be set by the API caller. So for instance, this value could be `Initial piedpiper link from user migration`. This value will be updated during the next login for the linked user based on the identify provider (`richard@piedpiper.com`, for instance). This value may not necessarily reflect the username or email you used to authenticate with the 3rd party identity provider.

[field]#identityProviderId# [type]#[UUID]#::
The unique Id of the identity provider.

[field]#identityProviderUserId# [type]#[String]#::
The Id for the User that is provided by the identity provider.

[field]#userId# [type]#[UUID]#::
The FusionAuth User Id that is linked to the identity provider.
