[field]#identityProvider.linkingStrategy# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `{idp_linking_strategy}`# [since]#Available since 1.28.0#::
The linking strategy to use when creating the link between the {idp_display_name} Identity Provider and the user.

The possible values are:
+
* `CreatePendingLink` - Do not automatically link, instead return a pending link identifier that can be used to link to an existing user.
* `LinkAnonymously` - Always create a link based upon the unique Id returned by the identify provider. A username or email is not required and will not be used to link the user. A reconcile lambda will not be used in this configuration.
* `LinkByEmail` - Link to an existing user based upon email. A user will be created with the email returned by the identity provider if one does not already exist.
* `LinkByEmailForExistingUser` - Only link to an existing user based upon email. A user will not be created if one does not already exist with email returned by the identity provider.
* `LinkByUsername` - Link to an existing user based upon username. A user will be created with the username returned by the identity provider if one does not already exist.
* `LinkByUsernameForExistingUser` - Only link to an existing user based upon username. A user will not be created if one does not already exist with username returned by the identity provider.
