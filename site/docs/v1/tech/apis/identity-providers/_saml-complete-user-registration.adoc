The user does not need to exist yet in FusionAuth to utilize this API. The `SAMLResponse` returned from the SAML v2 provider will be used to retrieve the user's email address, if that user does not yet exist in FusionAuth the user will be created. If [field]#Create registration# has been enabled for this identity provider and the user does not yet have a registration for this application, a registration will be automatically created for the user. 

The user will be assigned any default roles configured for the application. If create registration has not been enabled, a registration will not be created if one does not yet exist. This last scenario is useful if you wish to manually provision users and then subsequently allow them to login with this SAML v2 identity provider.
