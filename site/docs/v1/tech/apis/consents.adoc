== Overview

[NOTE.since]
====
This API has been available since 1.7.0
====

A FusionAuth Consent is a definition of a permission that can be given to a User. At a minimum a consent has a name, and defines the minimum age of self-consent. A consent can then be granted to a User from a family member or optionally a User may self-consent if they meet the minimum age defined by the consent.

The first API allows you to create, delete, update and retrieve a consent. The FusionAuth Consent is the object that defines the consent, the values, minimum ages, etc.

* <<Retrieve a Consent>>
* <<Search for Consents>>
* <<Update a Consent>>
* <<Delete a Consent>>

The second API is the User Consent API, this API allows you to grant a User Consent, and update a User Consent. In order to revoke a User Consent you simply need to update the consent status.
