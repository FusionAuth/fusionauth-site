To enable using `TextMessage` delivery, you may use the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/two-factor#send-a-two-factor-code[Two Factor Send] API to deliver a
code to the User, the User will then provide this code as input.

== Send a Two Factor Code

This API is used to send a Two Factor verification code to a User. This may be useful during Two Factor authentication if the initial
code is no longer valid. It may be also used to send a code to a User to assist in enabling or disabling Two Factor authentication.

To send a code to a User that already has Two Factor enabled, it is not required they have `TextMessage` set as their preferred delivery.
As long as the User has a mobile phone defined you may send the User a code.

This API requires that the link:/docs/v1/tech/integrations/twilio/[Twilio] integration is enabled and configured properly.
