title: Two Factor APIs
description: APIs for enabling and disabling Two Factor Authentication
---

== Overview

This API allows you to manage multi factor authentication (MFA) for users.

[WARNING.warning]
====
This API underwent breaking changes in version 1.26. You can view the link:../two-factor-1-25[1.25 documentation] if needed.
====

include::docs/v1/tech/shared/_premium-edition-blurb.adoc[]

The Authenticator/TOTP implementation is not a premium feature.

* <<Enable Two Factor>>
* <<Disable Two Factor>>
* <<Generate a Secret>>
* <<Start Two Factor>>
* <<Send a Two Factor Code During Login or Step Up>>
* <<Send a Two Factor Code When Enabling MFA>>
* <<Send a Two Factor Code When Disabling MFA>>

== Authentication

Some of these operations can use JWT authentication instead of API key authentication. 

Learn more about link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication/#jwt-authentication[JWT authentication and see examples here].

In some cases, when you have a valid [field]#twoFactorId#, neither a JWT nor an API key is required.

== Enable Two Factor

This API is used to enable Two Factor authentication for a single User. To use this API the User must provide a valid
Two Factor verification code.

If using a message based delivery mechanims, you may <<Send a Two Factor Code When Enabling MFA>> to deliver a
code to the User. The User will then provide this code as input.

.Response Codes
|===
|Code |Description

|200
|The request was successful. Two Factor has been enabled for the User.

|400
|The request was invalid and/or malformed. The response will contain an link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/errors/[Errors] JSON Object with the specific errors. This status will also be returned if a paid FusionAuth license is required and is not present.

|401
|You did not supply a valid Authorization header. The header was omitted or your API key was not valid. The response will be empty. See link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication/[Authentication]. 

|404
|The User does not exist. The response will be empty.

|421
|The `code` request parameter is not valid. The response will be empty.

|500
|There was an internal error. A stack trace is provided and logged in the FusionAuth log files. The response will be empty.

== Disable Two Factor

This API is used to disable Two Factor authentication for a single User. To use this API the User must provide a valid
Two Factor verification code.

If the User has configured `TextMessage` delivery, you may use the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/two-factor#send-a-two-factor-code[Two Factor Send] API to deliver a
code to the User, the User will then provide this code as input.

== Generate a Secret

This API is used to generate a new Two Factor secret for use when enabling Two Factor authentication for a User. This is provided
as a helper to assist you in enabling Two Factor authentication.

If this secret will be used with a QR code to allow the User to scan the value it will need utilize the Base32 encoded value returned in
the response.
