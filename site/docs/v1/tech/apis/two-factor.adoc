---

== Overview

This API allows you to manage Multi-Factor authentication (MFA) for users. 

[WARNING.warning]
====
This API underwent breaking changes in version 1.26. You can view the link:../two-factor-1-25[1.25 Two Factor documentation] if needed.

**However, the Authenticator/TOTP implementation is not a premium feature.**

== Authentication

Some of these operations can use JWT authentication instead of API key authentication. 

Learn more about link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication/#jwt-authentication[JWT authentication and see examples here].

In some cases, when you have a valid [field]#twoFactorId#, neither a JWT nor an API key is required.

== TOTP Implementation

Support for Authy, Google Authenticator and other time based one-time password solutions are not premium features and are included in the community edition.

include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_two-factor-totp-limits.adoc[]

== Enable Multi-Factor

This API is used to enable Multi-Factor authentication for a single User. To use this API the User must provide a valid
Multi-Factor verification code.

If using message based delivery, you may <<Send a Multi-Factor Code When Enabling MFA>> to deliver a
code to the User. The User will then provide this code as input.

.Response Codes
|===
|Code |Description

|200
|The request was successful. Multi-Factor has been enabled for the User.

|400
|The request was invalid and/or malformed. The response will contain an link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/errors/[Errors] JSON Object with the specific errors. This status will also be returned if a paid FusionAuth license is required and is not present.

|401
|You did not supply a valid Authorization header. The header was omitted or your API key was not valid. The response will be empty. See link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication/[Authentication]. 

|404
|The User does not exist. The response will be empty.

|421

|500
|There was an internal error. A stack trace is provided and logged in the FusionAuth log files. The response will be empty.

|503
|The search index is not available or encountered an exception so the request cannot be completed. The response will contain a JSON body.

== Disable Multi-Factor

This API is used to disable Multi-Factor authentication for a single User. To use this API the User must provide a valid
Multi-Factor verification code or recovery code.

If using message based delivery, you may <<Send a Multi-Factor Code When Disabling MFA>> to deliver a
code to the User. The User will then provide this code as input.

If a recovery code is provided, all methods will be removed.

== Generate a Secret

This API is used to generate a new Multi-Factor secret for use when enabling Multi-Factor authentication for a User. This is provided
as a helper to assist you in enabling Multi-Factor authentication.

If this secret will be used with a QR code to allow the User to scan the value, use the Base32 encoded value returned in the response.
