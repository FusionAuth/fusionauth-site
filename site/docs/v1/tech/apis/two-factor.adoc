description: APIs for enabling and disabling Multi-Factor Authentication
---

== Overview

include::docs/v1/tech/shared/_premium-edition-blurb.adoc[]

This API allows you to manage Multi-Factor authentication (MFA) for users.

[WARNING.warning]
====
This API underwent breaking changes in version 1.26. You can view the link:../two-factor-1-25[1.25 Two Factor documentation] if needed.
====


**However, the Authenticator/TOTP implementation is not a premium feature.**

== Authentication

Some of these operations can use JWT authentication instead of API key authentication. 

Learn more about link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication/#jwt-authentication[JWT authentication and see examples here].

In some cases, when you have a valid [field]#twoFactorId#, neither a JWT nor an API key is required.

== TOTP Implementation

Support for Authy, Google Authenticator and other time based one-time password solutions are not premium features and are included in the community edition.

include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_two-factor-totp-limits.adoc[]

== Enable Multi-Factor

This API is used to enable Multi-Factor authentication for a single User. To use this API the User must provide a valid
Multi-Factor verification code.

If using message based delivery, you may <<Send a Multi-Factor Code When Enabling MFA>> to deliver a
code to the User. The User will then provide this code as input.

== Disable Multi-Factor

This API is used to disable Multi-Factor authentication for a single User. To use this API the User must provide a valid
Multi-Factor verification code or recovery code.

If using message based delivery, you may <<Send a Multi-Factor Code When Disabling MFA>> to deliver a
code to the User. The User will then provide this code as input.

If a recovery code is provided, all methods will be removed.

== Generate a Secret

This API is used to generate a new Multi-Factor secret for use when enabling Multi-Factor authentication for a User. This is provided
as a helper to assist you in enabling Multi-Factor authentication.

If this secret will be used with a QR code to allow the User to scan the value, use the Base32 encoded value returned in the response.

=== Request

=== Response

The response for this API contains a Multi-Factor secret suitable for an authenticator like Google Authenticator.

==== Response Body

[.api]
[field]#secret# [type]#[String]#::
A Base64 encoded secret that may be used to enable Multi-Factor authentication.

[field]#secretBase32Encoded# [type]#[String]#::
A Base32 encoded form of the provided secret. This is useful if you need to provide a QR code to the User to enable Multi-Factor authentication.

== Start Multi-Factor

Starts an Multi-Factor request. This would be used for only step up auth, such as when sensitive data is requested.

If you want to provide your own code and/or deliver the code out of band using your own delivery mechanism, this is the right API call. Do not combine this with a <<Send a Multi-Factor Code During Login or Step Up>> call, as calling that API will invalidate all other codes associated with the [field]#twoFactorId#, including any you provide.

To require additional factors during login, <<Enable Multi-Factor>> for the User. Then FusionAuth will handle MFA code collection automatically, if you are using the hosted login pages, or send a status code in response to the login API if you are not.

=== Request

[.api-authentication]
link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[type=fas]] Start Multi-Factor Authentication
[.endpoint]

:missing_message!:

include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_two-factor-start-response-body.adoc[]

== Send a Multi-Factor Code During Login or Step Up

This operation allows you to send a message with a code to finish a Multi-Factor flow, and requires an existing [field]#twoFactorId#. No API key is required. 

This should only be used if you want FusionAuth to send the code. Do not use this if you are sending a code out of band or are using a TOTP based authentication method.

You can use this to re-send a code with the same or a different method. Using this API will invalidate all other codes previously associated with the provided [field]#twoFactorId#.

Sending a code invalidates all previous codes for the provided `twoFactorId`.
