[field]#userAction.preventLogin# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `false`#::
Whether or not this User Action will prevent user login. When this value is set to `true` the action must also be marked as a time based action. See `temporal`.

[field]#userAction.sendEndEvent# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `true`#::
Whether or not FusionAuth will send events to any registered Webhooks when this User Action expires.
+
Prior to version `1.36.7` this value defaulted to `false`. The default value was modified to be `true` by default to reduce confusion because in most cases when utilizing User Action events, the end event is desired.

[field]#userAction.startEmailTemplateId# [type]#[UUID]# [optional]#Optional#::
The Id of the Email Template that is used when User Actions are started (created).

[field]#userAction.temporal# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `false`#::
Whether or not this User Action is time-based (temporal). Time based actions are temporary and once expired the action will no longer be considered active and will not affect the user.
+
An action that prevents login must be time based.
+
Time based actions can still be applied to a user for an indefinite amount of time. A time based action is one that may be canceled or modified. A non time-based action may not be modified or canceled.
+
An example of a non time-based action would be a reward, such as sending a user a coupon. This action cannot be canceled, or modified. When a non time-based action is taken, it is immediately complete and will show up in the user action history.

[field]#userAction.userEmailingEnabled# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `false`#::
Whether or not email is enabled for this User Action. If this is true, a checkbox will appear in the FusionAuth UI for this User Action that allows admins to specify that they want to email the User.

[field]#userAction.userNotificationsEnabled# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `false`#::
Whether or not user notifications are enabled for this User Action. If this is true, a checkbox will appear in the FusionAuth UI for this User Action that allows admins to specify that they want to "notify users". What this does is send an additional flag named **notifyUser** in the event JSON that is sent to any registered Webhooks.
