== Overview

The core of FusionAuth is a set of RESTful APIs that allow you to quickly integrate login, registration and advanced User management features into your application. The FusionAuth web UI is built upon these APIs. Everything in the user interface is available through an API.

On this page you will find links to each of the API groups and a general overview of the API status codes you can expect back from each API. Each API will also document specific status codes and the specific meaning of the status code.

== APIs


Unless stated otherwise, all of the FusionAuth APIs will expect to receive a JSON request body. Ensure you have added the `Content-Type` HTTP header to your request.

== Status Codes

Each API may document specific status codes and provide a specific reason for returning that status code. This is a general overview of the status codes you may expect from an API and what they will mean to you.

[cols="1,9"]
.Response Codes
|===
|Code |Description

|200
|The request was successful. Generally the response body will contain JSON unless documented otherwise.

|400
|The request was invalid and/or malformed. The response will contain an link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/errors[Errors] JSON Object with the specific errors.

|401
|The request authentication failed. This request requires authentication and the API key was either omitted or invalid. In some cases this may also be returned if you are not authorized to make the request. See link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication[Authentication] for additional information on API authentication.

|404
|The object you requested doesn't exist. The response will be empty.

|405
|The HTTP method you requested is not allowed for the URI. This is a user error in making the HTTP request to the API. For example, if `POST` is the only supported way to call a particular API and you make the HTTP request with `GET`, you will receive a `405` status code. No body will be returned.

|500
|There was an internal error. A stack trace is provided and logged in the FusionAuth log files. The response will be empty. This is generally a FusionAuth error condition. If possible open a https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues[GitHub Issue] so we can help you resolve the issue.

|501
|The HTTP method you requested is not implemented. This is a user error in making the HTTP request to the API.

|503
|The requested action cannot be completed due the current rate of requests. Retry the request later.

|512
|A lambda invocation failed during this API request. An event log will have been created with details of the exception. See [breadcrumb]#System -> Event Log#.
|===

== The PATCH HTTP Method

There are three options for using `PATCH` operations. You choose between them by specifying a particular `Content-Type` on the request.

.PATCH options
[cols="1,1,1,1,1,1,1"]
|===
| Name | Content-Type | Array Behavior | Available Since | RFC Link | Client Library Support | Notes

|Original
|`application/json`
|Varies, sometimes a merge, other times an append. Read the documentation and test before using. Safest option is `GET` then `PUT`.
|1.12.0
|N/A
|Yes
|May be deprecated in the future.

|JSON Patch
|`application/json-patch+json`
|Uses operations to specify JSON modifications.
|1.39.0
|https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6902[RFC 6902]
|No
|https://json-patch-builder-online.github.io/[Useful patch builder tool]

|JSON Merge Patch
|`application/merge-patch+json`
|If target value is an array, overwrite the existing value with what is provided.
|1.39.0
|https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7396[RFC 7396]
|No
|N/A

|===

=== PATCH Example

Here's an example of how the different options work when used to modify the roles of a link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/groups[Group] which has roles of "ceo" and "dev" to remove the "dev" role.

If you are only modifying specific object fields, all three `PATCH` methods are equivalent. 

==== Original

With the original, pre 1.39.0 `PATCH` method, the correct way to remove the "dev" role is to request the group JSON, find the "ceo" role from the `roleIds` array, and use `PUT` to update the group object. 

[source,json,title=Original Group JSON]
----
include::docs/src/json/groups/patch/original.json[]
----

[source,json,title=PUT Request JSON]
----
{
  "group": {
    "name": "Paid employees",
    "data": {}
  },
  "roleIds": [
    "0a15cfdd-e231-4de4-9411-6d1015e05d99"
  ]
}
----

After you make this `PUT` request, the group JSON will look like this.

[source,json,title=Resulting Group JSON]
----
include::docs/src/json/groups/patch/response.json[]
----


==== JSON Patch

With JSON Patch, you have a flexible set of operations that can update, remove or move fields in a JSON object. Please review https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6902[RFC 6902] for the full list of operations. Here's the original JSON again:

[source,json,title=Original Group JSON]
----
include::docs/src/json/groups/patch/original.json[]
----

If you make a `PATCH` request with a `Content-Type` of `application/json-patch+json` and a body like below:

[source,json,title=JSON Patch Request JSON]
----
[
  {
    "op": "remove",
    "path": "/roleIds/1"
  }
]
----

This call removes the second value of the `roleIds` array, which corresponds to the "devs" role. You'll need to find what array element you want to delete, perhaps with a seperate request. After you make this `PATCH` request, the group JSON will look like this.

[source,json,title=Resulting Group JSON]
----
include::docs/src/json/groups/patch/response.json[]
----

This approach is precise and can make multiple changes to a given object with one call. It also requires you to learn a new set of operations. Additionally, the data is sent in format (an array of operations) which is only vaguely related to the structure of the object being changed.

==== JSON Merge Patch

JSON Merge Patch is a more straightforward way to update complex JSON objects. Please review https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7386[RFC 7386] for a full description of the patch behavior. Here's the original JSON again:

[source,json,title=Original Group JSON]
----
include::docs/src/json/groups/patch/original.json[]
----

If you make a `PATCH` request with a `Content-Type` of `application/merge-patch+json` and a body like below:

[source,json,title=JSON Patch Request JSON]
----
{
  "roleIds": [
    "0a15cfdd-e231-4de4-9411-6d1015e05d99"
  ]
}
----

After you make this `PATCH` request, the group JSON will look like this.

[source,json,title=Resulting Group JSON]
