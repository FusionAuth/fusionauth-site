You must provide either the **email** or the **username** field for each User. This will be used to authenticate the User and is also the User's unique identifier. These fields are marked as optional below, but you must provide one of them.

==== Request Body

[.api]
[field]#encryptionScheme# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#::
The encryption scheme used to encrypt plaintext passwords encountered in the request. If this value is omitted the system configured value will be used.

+
Omitting this value indicates the password is in plain text and it will be encrypted using the default password encryptor.
+
[WARNING]
====
Importing users with plain text passwords is very slow because FusionAuth will hash each one using the default scheme. Grab some popcorn and catch a movie it can take up to several hundred milliseconds per user.
====
+
The following encryptors are provided with FusionAuth:
+
* `link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/password-hashes/#salted-md5[salted-md5]`

* `link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/password-hashes/#salted-bcrypt[bcrypt]`
+
If you don't see the scheme needed for importing your existing password you can also create your own password encryptor or we can build it for you. See the link:/docs/v1/tech/plugins/custom-password-hashing/[Custom Password Hashing] section for more information.

The first name of the User.

[field]#users``[x]``.fullName# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#::

The User's middle name.

[field]#users``[x]``.mobilePhone# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#::
The User's mobile phone number. This is useful is you will be sending push notifications or SMS messages to the User.

[field]#users``[x]``.password# [type]#[String]# [required]#Required#::
The User's password. If [field]#encryptionScheme# is provided this value is the existing password hash, if [field]#encryptionScheme# is not provided this value is assumed to be plain text and it will be hashed during import.
+
When importing a bcrypt hash, you may have a value such as `$2a$10$N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMyeIjZAgcfl7p92ldGxad68LJZdL17lhWy`. This single string represents the bcrypt version, factor, salt and hash.
+
[field]#password# should contain only the password hash. For the above bcrypt hash, `N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMyeIjZAgcfl7p92ldGxad68LJZdL17lhWy` is the hash value and should be placed in the [field]#password# field.

[field]#users``[x]``.passwordChangeReason# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `Administrative`#::
When [field]#passwordChangeRequired# is set to `true` you may optionally set a reason for this change. The possible values are:
+
 * `Administrative` - the password must be changed due to an administrative action
 * `Breached` - the password must be changed due to it being identified as breached in some fashion
 * `Expired` - the password must be changed due to expiration
 * `Validation` - the password must be changed due to the password no longer meeting the configured minimum requirements
+
In practice, leaving the default makes the most sense. The other reasons are used by FusionAuth during runtime to automatically require a user to change their password.

[field]#users``[x]``.passwordChangeRequired# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `false`#::
Indicates that the User's password needs to be changed during the next login attempt.

Indicates that last link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/data-types/#instants[instant] the password was changed.
+
If `encryptionScheme` is omitted this value will be ignored and set to now.
+
Note that if you have enabled password expiration or plan to do so in the future and you set this value to `0` or some other arbitrary time in the past that is greater than the password expiration value in days, these users will be required to change their password. It is recommended that you omit this value and allow the default value to be set unless you know the last time the user changed their password.

[field]#users``[x]``.preferredLanguages# [type]#[Array<String>]# [optional]#Optional#::
An array of locale strings that give, in order, the User's preferred languages. These are important for email templates and other localizable text. See link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/data-types/#locales[Locales].

+
[deprecated]#Removed in version 1.26.0#

[field]#users``[x]``.twoFactorEnabled# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `false`#::
Determines if the User has two factor authentication enabled for their account or not.
+
See the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/two-factor#enable-two-factor[Enable Two Factor] and link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/two-factor#disable-two-factor[Disable Two Factor] APIs as an alternative to performing this action using the User API.
+
[deprecated]#Removed in version 1.26.0#

[field]#users``[x]``.twoFactorSecret# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional# [deprecated]#Deprecated#::
The Base64 encode secret used to generate Two Factor verification codes.
+
You may optionally use value provided in the `secret` field returned by the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/two-factor#generate-a-secret[Two Factor Secret] API instead of generating this value yourself.
+
Unless you are using `TextMessage` as your delivery type, ensure you are able to share the secret with the User before enabling Two Factor authentication. Beginning in version 1.17.0, if you do create a User with `TextMessage` set as the `twoFactorDelivery` type and you omit this value, the secret will be generated for you. The secret can be generated because it is not necessary to share the secret with the User for this delivery method.
+
When using `None` as the `twoFactorDelivery` this value will be required.
+
[deprecated]#Removed in version 1.26.0#

[field]#users``[x]``.username# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#::

[field]#users``[x]``.usernameStatus# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `ACTIVE`#::

include::_moderation_status_request.adoc[]

[field]#users``[x]``.verified# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `false`#::
Set this value to `true` in order to mark the user as having a verified email address.

[field]#validateDbConstraints# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `false`#::
Set this value to `true` in order to perform additional validation of the request.
+
The import request is intended to be used to populate the initial set of users, this means FusionAuth does not expect to find duplicate users in the database. If a duplicate is encountered a `500` will be returned without this additional validation.
+
If you intend to use this API with existing users in FusionAuth set this value to `true` to request additional validation be performed on the input request and a `400` response will be returned with JSON body indicating the duplicate values encountered.
+
Setting this value to `true` will dramatically decrease the performance of this request. If importing large numbers of users in a single request you may need to increase request timeouts to ensure this request does not timeout before it has completed.
