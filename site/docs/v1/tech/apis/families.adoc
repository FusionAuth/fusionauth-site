== Overview

[NOTE.since]
====
This API has been available since 1.7.0
====

A Family allows you to define relationships between one or more Users. A adult User may belong to a single Family, a teen or child may belong to one or more families.

The following APIs are provided to manage Families and Family memberships.

* <<Create a Family>>
* <<Add a User to a Family>>
* <<Retrieve a Family>>
* <<Update a Family>>
* <<Remove a User from a Family>>
* <<Retrieve Pending Family Members>>
* <<Request Parental Approval>>

== Create a Family

You cannot directly create a Family, instead a Family is implicitly created when the first User is added. To create a Family, add a User to a Family that does not currently exist. 

The User must have a [field]#role# of `Adult` and [field]#owner# must be set to `true`.
