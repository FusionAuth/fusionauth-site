==== Request Headers

[.api]
[field]#X-FusionAuth-TenantId# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#::
The unique Id of the tenant used to scope this API request.
+
The tenant Id is not required on this request even when more than one tenant has been configured because the tenant can be identified based upon the request parameters or it is otherwise not required.
+
Specify a tenant Id on this request when you want to ensure the request is scoped to a specific tenant. The tenant Id may be provided through this header or by using a tenant locked API key to achieve the same result.
