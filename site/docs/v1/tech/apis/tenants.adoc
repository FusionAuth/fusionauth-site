== Overview

A FusionAuth Tenant is a named object that represents a discrete namespace for Users, Applications and Groups. A user is unique by email
address or username within a tenant.

Tenants may be useful to support a multi-tenant application where you wish to use a single instance of FusionAuth but require the ability to
have duplicate users across the tenants
in your own application. In this scenario a user may exist multiple times with the same email address and different passwords across tenants.

Tenants may also be useful in a test or staging environment to allow multiple users to call APIs and create and modify users without
possibility of collision.

The following APIs are provided to manage Tenants.

* <<Create a Tenant>>
* <<Retrieve a Tenant>>
* <<Update a Tenant>>
* <<Delete a Tenant>>

The following APIs provide a subset of the Tenant configuration without an API Key.

* <<Retrieve the Password Validation Rules>>
