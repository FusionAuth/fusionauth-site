The key is the path to the value in the `user` or `registration` object.

*Predefined keys*
+
Predefined keys are typed values managed by FusionAuth. When using a pre-defined key, the field data type and form control are not configurable.
+
 * `registration.username`
 * `user.birthDate`
 * `user.email`
 * `user.firstname`
 * `user.fullName`
 * `user.lastName`
 * `user.middleName`
 * `user.mobilePhone`
 * `user.password`
 * `user.username`
+
&nbsp;
+
*Custom Keys*
+
When defining a key to store custom data, you may use one of the following prefixes:
+
 * `user.data.`
 * `registration.data`.
+
For example, in order to store a custom value on the user object to collect the User's favorite color, set the key value equal to `user.data.favoriteColor`.
+
A valid key name must not contain spaces or special characters. An array may be specified by using the array syntax of `[0]` to indicate the first position in an array. Nested objects may be specified by using the object syntax of `['foo']` to indicate the named property of the object named `foo`. Consider the following examples:
+
 * `user.data.preferences[0]` would store the value in the first position of an array named `preferences`.
 * `user.data.preferences['color']` would store the value in an object named `preferences` with a key of `color`.
+

+
*Localization*
+
You may localize the displayed value of this key during registration by adding the key to your theme.
For example, if you specify the key value of `user.data.favoriteColor` this key value be rendered in the UI.
+
If you were to add the following messages to your theme, the localized form of the value will be shown to the end user. This allows you to provide a human readable field name and optionally localize the field name as well.
+
```
user.data.favoriteColor=Favorite color
```
