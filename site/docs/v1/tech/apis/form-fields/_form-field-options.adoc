A list of options that are applied to `checkbox`, `radio`, or `select` controls.
+
You may translate the displayed values during registration by adding these values to your theme.
+
For example, if you specify the values `["red", "green", "blue"]` as the field options, these will be stored on the user in this lowercase form. By default the values `red`, `green` and `blue` will be rendered in the UI.
+
If you were to add the following messages to your theme, the capitalized form of the values will be shown to the end user. This allows you optionally localize the displayed values as well.
+
```
red=Red
green=Green
blue=Blue
```
+
```
red=Roja
green=Verde
blue=Azul
```
