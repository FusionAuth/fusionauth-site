The data type used to store the value in FusionAuth. The possible values are:
+
 * `bool`
 * `consent`
 * `date`
 * `email`
 * `number`
 * `string`
+
If the value provided by the user cannot be converted to the requested data type a validation error will occur.
+
When using the `date` type, the only supported data format is ISO-8601 or `YYY-MM-DD`. You may want to use a JavaScript data picker that can convert the selected value to this format.
+
When using the `consent` type, the field [field]#consentId# must be included in the request.
