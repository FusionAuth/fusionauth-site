 * `date` the value will be stored as a date. The value must be formatted as ISO-8601 or `YYY-MM-DD`, you may want to use a JavaScript data picker that can convert the selected value to this format.

All user provided input will be validated to ensure it can be stored in this data type. If the user input cannot be converted a validation error will be shown to the user. When providing options for this control each option must also be compatible with this data type.
+
When using the `consent` type, the field [field]#consentId# is required and must be included in the request.
+
The data type can only be set for custom fields, and if not provided the default value will be `string`. For all managed fields, such as `user.firstName`, the data type will be set by FusionAuth and it may not be modified.
