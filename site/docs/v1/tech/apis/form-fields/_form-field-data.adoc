An object that can hold any information about the Form Field that should be persisted.
This may be useful to add additional meta data to the field that will help you style or render the Form Field. For example, in the JSON examples provided for this API you will see an attribute added to this data field as follows:
+
```
"data": {
 "leftAddOn": "user"
}
```
This additional meta data is then used to render an icon on the Form Field. Use of this additional data is optional and not required to render the field.
