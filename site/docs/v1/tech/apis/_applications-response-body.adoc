.Response Body for all Applications
|===
|[field]#applications# [type]#[Array]#
|The list of Application objects.

|[field]#applications``[x]``.id# [type]#[UUID]#
|The Id of the Application.

|[field]#applications``[x]``.active# [type]#[Boolean]#
|Whether or not the Application is active.

|[field]#applications``[x]``.authenticationTokenConfiguration.enabled# [type]#[Boolean]#
|Whether or not Users can have Authentication Tokens associated with this Application.

|[field]#applications``[x]``.cleanSpeakConfiguration.applicationIds# [type]#[Array<UUID>]#
|An array of UUIDs that map to the CleanSpeak applications for this Application. It is possible that a single Application in FusionAuth might have multiple Applications in CleanSpeak. For example, a FusionAuth Application for a game might have one CleanSpeak Application for usernames and another Application for chat.

This property is used when CleanSpeak sends user action notifications to FusionAuth (when users are disciplined for example). FusionAuth will translate the CleanSpeak ids to FusionAuth ids and then apply the user action.

|True if CleanSpeak integration is enabled. This setting is global and is not modifiable using this API.

|[field]#applications``[x]``.cleanSpeakConfiguration.usernameModeration.applicationId# [type]#[UUID]#
|The Id of the CleanSpeak application that usernames are sent to for moderation.

|[field]#applications``[x]``.cleanSpeakConfiguration.usernameModeration.enabled# [type]#[Boolean]#
|True if CleanSpeak username moderation is enabled.

|[field]#applications``[x]``.data# [type]#[Object]#
|An object that can hold any information about the Application that should be persisted.
