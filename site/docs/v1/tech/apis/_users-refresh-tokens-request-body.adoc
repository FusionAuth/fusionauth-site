[field]#refreshTokens``[x]``.startInstant# [type]#[String]# [required]#Required#::
The link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/data-types#instants[instant] of the start of this token. This value will be used to calculate the token expiration.

[field]#refreshTokens``[x]``.token# [type]#[String]# [required]#Required#::
The string representation of the refresh token.
+
Prior to version `1.33.0`, this value was limited to a maximum length of `191` characters. If you need to import a token that is longer than `191` characters, ensure you have upgraded to version `1.33.0` or later.

[field]#refreshTokens``[x]``.userId# [type]#[UUID]# [required]#Required#::
The unique user Id of the refresh token owner.

[field]#validateDbConstraints# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `false`#::
Set this value to `true` in order to perform additional validation of the request. This validation includes, among other things, confirming that a user exists and is registered for the application which this `refreshToken` was created for.
+
If this is `false`, any errors such as duplicated refresh token values will return a `500` error without any additional messages.  If this is `true`, additional validation will be performed on the input request and a `400` response will be returned with a JSON body indicating duplicate values or other error conditions encountered.
+
Setting this value to `true` will dramatically decrease the performance of this request. If importing large numbers of tokens in a single request you may need to increase request timeouts to ensure this request does not timeout before it has completed.
