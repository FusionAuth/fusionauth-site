The Id of the Application the user is to be logged into. This parameter is optional but there is not likely a production use case where you want to omit the value. If this parameter is omitted the user will still be authenticated but a login count will not be recorded for an Application.

ifndef::login_instant_section[]
Because a refresh token is per user and per application, when this parameter is not provided a refresh token will not be returned.

You likely want the user being logged in to be registered for this application. If that user isn't, the call will succeed, the response body will be different, no refresh token will be issued, and you'll receive a `202` HTTP status.
