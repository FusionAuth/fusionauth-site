==== Request Parameters

[.api]
[field]#userId# [type]#[UUID]# [required]#Required#::
The unique Id of the User for which to retrieve all of the Actions.

[field]#active# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional#::
When this parameter is provided and set to `true`, only active actions will be returned. When this parameter is provided and set to `false`, only the inactive actions will be returned. When this parameter is omitted, all actions will be returned.
+
An active action is a time based action that has not yet expired or been canceled. An inactive action is either a time based action that has expired, canceled or an action that is not time based.
+
This parameter and `preventingLogin` are mutually exclusive.

[field]#preventingLogin# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [since]#Available since 1.4.0#::
When this value is provided and set to `true`, only active actions that are preventing the user from login will be returned. Omitting this parameter, or setting this parameter to `false` does not affect the API behavior.
+
This parameter and `active` are mutually exclusive because an action that is preventing login is always active.
