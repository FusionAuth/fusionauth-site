---

== Overview

The FusionAuth APIs are primarily secured using API keys, a few APIs may optionally take a JWT. Below you will find a detailed explanation of each type of authentication used in the API documentation.

* icon:lock[role=red,type=fas] &nbsp;<<API Key Authentication>>
* icon:id-badge[role=green,type=fas] &nbsp;<<JWT Authentication>>
* icon:unlock[role=green,type=fas] &nbsp;<<No Authentication Required>>

{nbsp} +

API keys must be created in the FusionAuth admin user interface, this function is not available through an API for security reasons. To manage API keys navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> API Keys#.

== API Key Authentication

When an API is marked with a red locked icon such as &nbsp;&nbsp;icon:lock[role=red,type=fas] it means you are required to provide authentication.
FusionAuth primarily controls access to the API through the use of an API key. All secured APIs by default all APIs will return an `401 Unauthorized` response.

To enable access to a secured API create one or more API keys in the FusionAuth user interface. The API key is then supplied in the HTTP
 request using the Authorization header.  See API Keys for more information on adding additional keys.

[.example]
--
The following example demonstrates the HTTP Authorization header with an API key of `2524a832-c1c6-4894-9125-41a9ea84e013`.
[source,properties]
----
Authorization: 2524a832-c1c6-4894-9125-41a9ea84e013

The following is a cURL example using the Authorization header using the same API key as above with line breaks and spaces for readability.
[source,shell]
----
curl -H 'Authorization: 2524a832-c1c6-4894-9125-41a9ea84e013'

== JWT Authentication

When an API is marked with a green identity icon such as &nbsp;icon:id-badge[role=green, title="Supports JWT",type=fas]&nbsp; it means you may call this API without
 an API key but instead provide a JSON Web Token (JWT) pronounced "jot". These APIs may be called with a signed token in place of an API key. A JWT is
 obtained from the Login API. The token will also be provided as an HTTP Only Session cookie. If cookies are being managed for you by the browser or some
 other RESTful client, the JWT cookie will automatically be send to FusionAuth on your behalf and you may omit the `Authorization` header.

=== Authorization Header Examples

[.example]
--
The following example demonstrates the HTTP Authorization header using the Bearer schema. Prior to version `1.12.0` only the JWT schema was available.
[source,properties]
----
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE0ODUxNDA5ODQsImlhdCI6MTQ4NTEzNzM4NCwiaXNzIjoiYWNtZS5jb20iLCJzdWIiOiIyOWFjMGMxOC0wYjRhLTQyY2YtODJmYy0wM2Q1NzAzMThhMWQiLCJhcHBsaWNhdGlvbklkIjoiNzkxMDM3MzQtOTdhYi00ZDFhLWFmMzctZTAwNmQwNWQyOTUyIiwicm9sZXMiOltdfQ.Mp0Pcwsz5VECK11Kf2ZZNF_SMKu5CgBeLN9ZOP04kZo

=== Cookie Example

If a cookie is provided on a request that accepts an API key or an JWT, the API key will be preferred.

[.example]
--
The following is an HTTP GET request with the JWT Access Token provided as a cookie.
[source,shell]
----
GET /api/user HTTP/1.1
Cookie: access_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE0ODUxNDA5ODQsImlhdCI6MTQ4NTEzNzM4NCwiaXNzIjoiYWNtZS5jb20iLCJzdWIiOiIyOWFjMGMxOC0wYjRhLTQyY2YtODJmYy0wM2Q1NzAzMThhMWQiLCJhcHBsaWNhdGlvbklkIjoiNzkxMDM3MzQtOTdhYi00ZDFhLWFmMzctZTAwNmQwNWQyOTUyIiwicm9sZXMiOltdfQ.Mp0Pcwsz5VECK11Kf2ZZNF_SMKu5CgBeLN9ZOP04kZo

== No Authentication Required

When an API that is marked with an unlocked icon such as &nbsp;icon:unlock-alt[role=green, title="No authentication required",type=fas] it means that you are not
 required to provide an `Authorization` header as part of the request. The API is either designed to be publicly accessible or the request may take a parameter that is itself secure.

== Manage API Keys

Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> API Keys# to manage API keys.

Create as many API keys as you like, each one may be optionally limited in ability to minimize security risk.

For example, the User API `/api/user` has four HTTP methods, `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE`. While each API may have different semantics, in a general sense you can think of these four HTTP methods as being retrieve, create, update and delete respectively. With that in mind, if you'd like to create an API key that can only retrieve users, you would limit the API key to the `GET` method on the `/api/user` API.

When you create an API key the key is defaulted to a secure random value but the API key is simply a string, so you may call it `super-secret-key` if you'd like. However a long and random value makes a good API key in that it is unique and difficult to guess.

=== Create an API Key

==== Form Fields

[.api]
[field]#Key#::
A unique key to be utilized to authorize API requests using the `Authorization` header.

[field]#Description#::
An optional description of how this API key will be utilized.

[field]#Tenant#::
The optional tenant to which this API key will be assigned. This value cannot be changed once the API key is created. This field is only displayed when more than one tenant exists. When you assign an API key to a tenant, you will only be able to operate on users, applications, and groups in the selected tenant.

[field]#Endpoints#::
Select one or more endpoints this API key will be authorized to access. Selecting no endpoints will authorize this key to all API endpoints.
