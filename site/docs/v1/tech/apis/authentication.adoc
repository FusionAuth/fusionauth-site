== Overview

The FusionAuth APIs are primarily secured using API keys. A few APIs may use alternate credentials, such as a JWT, basic authentication. Certain APIs are accessible with no authentication. All secured APIs will return an `401 Unauthorized` response if improper credentials are provided.

Each API endpoint is marked with an icon describing supported authentication methods:

* icon:lock[type=fas] &nbsp;<<API Key Authentication>>
* icon:shield-alt[type=fas] &nbsp;<<Basic Authentication using an API Key>>
* icon:passport[type=fas] &nbsp;<<Client Credentials>>
* icon:id-badge[type=fas] &nbsp;<<JWT Authentication>>
* icon:unlock[type=fas] &nbsp;<<No Authentication Required>>

You can also learn about:

* <<Managing API Keys>>
* <<Making an API Request Using a Tenant Id>>
* <<API Key Permissions>>
* <<Client Side API Keys>>
* <<Troubleshooting>>

Below you will find a detailed explanation of each type of authentication used in the API documentation.

== API Key Authentication

When an API is marked with a red locked icon such as &nbsp;&nbsp;icon:lock[type=fas,title="Supports API keys"]&nbsp; it means you are required to provide an API key. 

To enable access to a secured API, create one or more API keys. The API key is then supplied in the HTTP request using the Authorization header. See <<Managing API Keys>> for more information on adding additional keys.

The following example demonstrates the HTTP Authorization header with an API key of `7DUrRlA75b5LBRARYoTmScCTk6G6U1nG8R9mr7MGnvzA7AMxEXAMPLE`.

[source,properties]

== Basic Authentication using an API Key

[NOTE.since]
====
This authentication method has been available since 1.27.0
====

When an API endpoint is marked with a shield such as &nbsp;icon:shield-alt[title="Supports Basic Auth",type=fas]&nbsp; it means you call this API and authenticate using HTTP basic authentication. HTTP basic authentication is a simple, standards based, authentication method. A username and password are supplied, separated by a `:`. It must be prefaced by the string `Basic` and a space. The `username:password` string is base64 encoded.

When using this authentication method in FusionAuth for an API, the username must be the string `apikey` in lowercase. The password may be any API key with the appropriate permission for the endpoint being called.

Basic authentication using an API key is only utilized by a select few FusionAuth APIs. These are typically integrated with other software packages which expect such an authentication method.

=== Authorization Header Examples

The following example demonstrates the HTTP Basic Authorization header. 
[source,properties]

Authorization: Basic YXBpa2V5OjY5Y1dxVW8wNGhpNFdMdUdBT2IzMmRXZXQwalpkVzBtSkNjOU9yLUxEamNIUXFMSzJnR29mS3plZg==
----

The following is a curl example using the HTTP Basic Authorization header with a line break and spaces for readability.
[source,shell]
----
curl -X GET  \
-H 'Authorization: Basic YXBpa2V5OjY5Y1dxVW8wNGhpNFdMdUdBT2IzMmRXZXQwalpkVzBtSkNjOU9yLUxEamNIUXFMSzJnR29mS3plZg==' \
'https://local.fusionauth.io/api/prometheus/metrics'
----

== Client Credentials

When an API is marked with a red passport icon such as &nbsp;icon:passport[title="Supports Client Credentials",type=fas]&nbsp;, the authorization becomes a two step process. To complete the process and generate a token you must:

* Use the `client_credentials` grant to obtain a JSON Web Token (JWT). The requester should be granted the appropriate permissions on the target entity.
* Make a request of the API with the JWT in the `Authorization` header using the `Bearer` scheme.

If the JWT is expired or incorrect, the request will fail.

The requesting and target entities, as well as permissions, are all managed using link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/entity-management[Entities].

== Client Credentials Examples 

Here is an example link:/docs/v1/tech/oauth/#example-client-credentials-grant[client credentials grant using Entities].

Here's another example. First, you get the token:

[source,shell,title="Curl example to retrieve JWT"]
----
curl -u "eb6fce6a-4ed8-4010-8091-1709fc823329:_7bz1Ct1Sode-zIyevcQFSyzW9w3TkfKSWuS-Ls8vQQ" \
  https://local.fusionauth.io/oauth2/token \
  -d 'grant_type=client_credentials&scope=target-entity:a647e989-1c7e-4386-9ec6-fa4fe6908906:scim:user:read'
----

Here's an example JWT that might be returned:

[source,properties,title="SCIM request example Authorization header"]
----
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImd0eSI6WyJjbGllbnRfY3JlZGVudGlhbHMiXSwia2lkIjoiMDUzYWE1Y2QxIiwidXNlIjoic2NpbV9zZXJ2ZXIifQ.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.XNLUF-8IT5Mh411uD0jOb_3aaT5YJrbM6q4PZrOxfbQ
----

After retrieving the JWT, place it in the `Authorization` header with a prefix of `Bearer `. Then you call the API endpoint:

[source,shell,title="Curl example to call API"]
----
curl -XGET -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbG..." 'https://local.fusionauth.io/api/scim/resource/v2/Users'
----

== JWT Authentication

When an API is marked with a blue identity icon such as &nbsp;icon:id-badge[title="Supports JWT",type=fas]&nbsp; it means you may call this API without
an API key. Instead, provide a JSON Web Token (JWT). A JWT is obtained from the Login API or an OAuth grant. The token will also be provided as an HTTP Only Session cookie. If cookies are being managed for you by the browser or some
other RESTful client, the JWT cookie will automatically be sent to FusionAuth on your behalf. In this case, you may omit the `Authorization` header.

=== Authorization Header Examples

The following example demonstrates the HTTP Authorization header using the `Bearer` scheme.

[source,properties]
----
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE0ODUxNDA5ODQsImlhdCI6MTQ4NTEzNzM4NCwiaXNzIjoiYWNtZS5jb20iLCJzdWIiOiIyOWFjMGMxOC0wYjRhLTQyY2YtODJmYy0wM2Q1NzAzMThhMWQiLCJhcHBsaWNhdGlvbklkIjoiNzkxMDM3MzQtOTdhYi00ZDFhLWFmMzctZTAwNmQwNWQyOTUyIiwicm9sZXMiOltdfQ.Mp0Pcwsz5VECK11Kf2ZZNF_SMKu5CgBeLN9ZOP04kZo
----

The following is a curl example using the HTTP Authorization header using the `Bearer` scheme with a line break and spaces for readability.

[source,shell]
----
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE0ODUxNDA5ODQsImlhdCI6MTQ4NTEzNzM4NCwiaXNzIjoiYWNtZS5jb20iLCJzdWIiOiIyOWFjMGMxOC0wYjRhLTQyY2YtODJmYy0wM2Q1NzAzMThhMWQiLCJhcHBsaWNhdGlvbklkIjoiNzkxMDM3MzQtOTdhYi00ZDFhLWFmMzctZTAwNmQwNWQyOTUyIiwicm9sZXMiOltdfQ.Mp0Pcwsz5VECK11Kf2ZZNF_SMKu5CgBeLN9ZOP04kZo' \
     https://example.fusionauth.io/api/user
----

=== Cookie Example

If a cookie is provided on a request to an endpoint which accepts an API key or an JWT, the API key will be preferred.

The following is an HTTP GET request with the JWT Access Token provided as a cookie.

[source,shell]
----
GET /api/user HTTP/1.1
Cookie: access_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE0ODUxNDA5ODQsImlhdCI6MTQ4NTEzNzM4NCwiaXNzIjoiYWNtZS5jb20iLCJzdWIiOiIyOWFjMGMxOC0wYjRhLTQyY2YtODJmYy0wM2Q1NzAzMThhMWQiLCJhcHBsaWNhdGlvbklkIjoiNzkxMDM3MzQtOTdhYi00ZDFhLWFmMzctZTAwNmQwNWQyOTUyIiwicm9sZXMiOltdfQ.Mp0Pcwsz5VECK11Kf2ZZNF_SMKu5CgBeLN9ZOP04kZo
----

== No Authentication Required

When an API that is marked with a green unlocked icon such as &nbsp;icon:unlock-alt[role=green, title="No authentication required",type=fas]&nbsp; it means that you are not required to provide an `Authorization` header as part of the request. The API is either designed to be publicly accessible or the request may take a parameter that is in itself secure.

== Managing API Keys

Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> API Keys# to manage API keys.

Create as many API keys as you like, each one may be optionally limited in ability to minimize security risk.

For example, the User API `/api/user` has five HTTP methods, `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE`. While each API may have different semantics, in a general sense you can think of these HTTP methods as being retrieve, create, update, partial update, and delete respectively. With that in mind, if you'd like to create an API key that can only retrieve users, limit the API key to the `GET` method on the `/api/user` API.

When you create an API key, the key value is defaulted to a secure random value. However, the API key is a string, so you may set it to `super-secret-key`, a UUID such as `02e56c92-f5e1-4b0f-8298-b5103bc7add7`, or any other string value that you'd like. A long and random value makes a good API key because it is unique and difficult to guess, so allowing FusionAuth to create the key value is recommended.

=== Managing API Keys via the API

Prior to version `1.26.0`, the FusionAuth administrative user interface was the only way to create API keys. This functionality was not available through an API. Starting from version 1.26.0, API keys may be created using an API. Please refer to the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/api-keys[API Key API] for more information.

=== Create an API Key

image::create-api-key.png[Create an API Key,width=1200]

==== Form Fields

[.api]
[field]#Id#::
The unique Id of this API key.

[field]#Key#::
The unique string representing the API key. This is what is presented in the `Authorization` header for requests to FusionAuth.

[field]#Description#::
An optional description of this API key.

[field]#Tenant#::
The optional tenant to which this API key will be assigned. This value cannot be changed once the API key is created. 
+
When you assign an API key to a tenant, any requests made with this key will only be able to operate on users, applications, groups, and other entities in the selected tenant.

[field]#Endpoints#::
One or more endpoints this API key will be authorized to access. 
+
Selecting no endpoints will *authorize this key for all API endpoints*.

[field]#Key Manager#::
Enable to have this key be a key manager. When a key is a key manager, it can be used to call the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/api-keys#[API keys APIs].
+
Being able to create other API keys via the API is a *privileged operation*. Use it wisely.
+
Any attempt to call the API Keys API with a non-manager key (`keyManager` set to `false`) will return a HTTP response status code `401`.

include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_tenant-authentication.adoc[]

== API Key Permissions

Each API Key can be granted zero or more endpoint permissions.
Each permission corresponds to an endpoint and an HTTP method.
API keys are limited to the allowed endpoints and HTTP methods.

[WARNING.warning]
====
If you do not grant any endpoint permissions to an API key, the key has access to *all endpoints* and is essentially a 'super user' key.
====

These permissions are managed via the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/api-keys[API Key API] or in the administrative user interface under the [breadcrumb]#Endpoints# section.
When using the administrative user interface, you may click on the HTTP method column or the endpoint row.
Either will toggle all the settings for the column or row, respectively.

image::api-key-endpoint-permissions.png[API Key endpoint permissions.,width=1200,role=top-cropped]

For example, if you were to grant an API key `POST` permissions on `/api/user`, the API key would be able to create users in FusionAuth.
Any calls with this API key would be denied access to any other functionality, including listing users, creating applications, and deleting registrations.

Calling other endpoints would result in a `401` response code.
