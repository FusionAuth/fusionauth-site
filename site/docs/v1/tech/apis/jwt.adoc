title: JWT & Refresh Token APIs
description: APIs that allow you to manage Refresh Tokens, verify Access Tokens and retrieve public keys used for verifying JWT signatures.

== Overview

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are portable identity tokens. A JWT is issued after completing a link:login#authenticate-a-user[Login] request and is used to identify a user. JWTs can be used to call various FusionAuth APIs or they can be used to authenticate and authorize your APIs. In this document the term JWT and access token are used interchangeably.

* <<Reconcile a JWT>>

* <<Revoke Refresh Tokens>>


== Issue a JWT
This API is used to issue a new access token (JWT) using an existing access token (JWT).

This API provides the single signon mechanism for access tokens. For example you have an access token for application A and you need an access
token for application B. You may use this API to request an access token to application B with the authorized token to application A. The returned access token will have the same expiration of the one provided.

This API will use a JWT as authentication. See link:authentication#jwt-authentication[JWT Authentication] for examples of how you can send the JWT to FusionAuth.

=== Request

[.api-authentication]
link:authentication#jwt-authentication[icon:id-badge[role=green,type=far]] Issue an Access Token
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#GET# [uri]#/api/jwt/issue``?applicationId=\{applicationId\}&refreshToken=\{refreshToken\}``#
--

[cols="3a,7a"]
[.api]
.Request Parameters
|===
|[field]#applicationId# [type]#[UUID]# [required]#Required#
|The Id of the application for which authorization is being requested.

|[field]#refreshToken# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|An existing refresh token used to request a refresh token in addition to a JWT in the response. If the cookie `refresh_token` is also on the request it will take precedence over this value.

The target application represented by the [field]#applicationid# request parameter must have refresh tokens enabled in order to receive a refresh token in the response.

|[field]#token# [type]#[String]#
|The encoded access token.

|[field]#refreshToken# [type]#[String]#

== Reconcile a JWT
The Reconcile API is used to take a JWT issued by a third party identity provider as described by an link:identity-providers/[Identity Provider]
configuration and reconcile the User represented by the JWT to FusionAuth.

=== Request

[.api-authentication]
link:authentication#no-authentication-required[icon:unlock-alt[role=green,type=far]] Reconcile a JWT
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#POST# [uri]#/api/jwt/reconcile#
--

[cols="3a,7a"]
[.api]
.Request Headers
|===
|[field]#X-Forwarded-For# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|The IP address of a client requesting authentication. If the IP address is provided it will be stored for login history of the user. It is
generally preferred to specify the IP address in the request body. If it is not provided in the request body this header value will be used
if available, the request body value will take precedence.

|===

include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_reconcile-request-body.adoc[]

=== Response

The response for this API contains the User object.

[cols="1,9a"]
.Response Codes
|===
|Code |Description

|200
|The reconcile was successful. The response will contain the User object that was authenticated.

|400
|The request was invalid and/or malformed. The response will contain an link:errors[Errors] JSON Object with the specific errors.

|401
|The request cannot be completed. The `identityProviderId` is invalid, the JWT signature cannot be validated, the JWT does not contain a claim
identified by the `uniqueIdentityClaim` property in the Identity Provider configuration, or the domain of the email address claim in the JWT
is not managed by the Identity Provider Configuration.

|404
|The user was not found or the password was incorrect. The response will be empty.

|500
|There was an internal error. A stack trace is provided and logged in the FusionAuth log files. The response will be empty.

|503
|The search index is not available or encountered an exception so the request cannot be completed. The response will contain a JSON body.

.Response Cookies
|===
|[field]#access_token# [type]#[String]#
|The encoded access token. This cookie is written in the response as an HTTP Only session cookie.

|[field]#refresh_token# [type]#[String]#
|The refresh token. This cookie is written in the response as an HTTP only persistent cookie. The cookie expiration is configured in the JWT
configuration for the application or the global JWT configuration.
