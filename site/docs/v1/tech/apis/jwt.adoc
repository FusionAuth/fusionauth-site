title: JWT & Refresh Token APIs
description: APIs that allow you to manage Refresh Tokens, verify Access Tokens and retrieve public keys used for verifying JWT signatures.
---

== Overview

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are portable identity tokens. A JWT is issued after completing a link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/login#authenticate-a-user[Login] request and is used to identify a user. JWTs can be used to call various FusionAuth APIs or they can be used to authenticate and authorize your APIs. In this document the term JWT and access token are used interchangeably.

* <<Issue a JWT>>
* <<Reconcile a JWT>>
* <<Retrieve Public Keys>>
* <<Refresh a JWT>>
* <<Retrieve Refresh Tokens>>
* <<Revoke Refresh Tokens>>
* <<Validate a JWT>>
* <<Vend a JWT>>

Here's a presentation discussing how to use JWTs in a microservices architecture:

== Issue a JWT
This API is used to issue a new access token (JWT) using an existing access token (JWT).

This API provides the single signon mechanism for access tokens. For example you have an access token for application A and you need an access
token for application B. You may use this API to request an access token to application B with the authorized token to application A. The returned access token will have the same expiration of the one provided.

This API will use a JWT as authentication. See link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication#jwt-authentication[JWT Authentication] for examples of how you can send the JWT to FusionAuth.

=== Request

[.api-authentication]
link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication#jwt-authentication[icon:id-badge[type=fas]] Issue a JWT
[.endpoint]

--
[method]#GET# [uri]#/api/jwt/issue``?applicationId=\{applicationId\}&refreshToken=\{refreshToken\}``#
--

==== Request Parameters

[.api]
[field]#applicationId# [type]#[UUID]# [required]#Required#::
The Id of the application for which authorization is being requested.

[field]#refreshToken# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#::
An existing refresh token used to request a refresh token in addition to a JWT in the response. If the cookie `refresh_token` is also on the request it will take precedence over this value.
+
The target application represented by the [field]#applicationId# request parameter must have refresh tokens enabled in order to receive a refresh token in the response.

include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_x-fusionauth-tenant-id-header-scoped-operation.adoc[]

The refresh token. This value will only be returned if a valid non-expired refresh token was provided on the request and [field]#application.loginConfiguration.generateRefreshTokens# is `true`. The returned refresh token will share the same creation time as the original refresh token in regards to how the token expiration is calculated.
+
The refresh token expiration policy as defined by [field]#jwtConfiguration.refreshTokenExpirationPolicy# must be the same as the source application, if the policies are different a refresh token will not be returned.

== Reconcile a JWT

The Reconcile API is used to take a JWT issued by a third party identity provider as described by an link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/identity-providers/[Identity Provider]
configuration and reconcile the User represented by the JWT to FusionAuth.

=== Request

[.api-authentication]
link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication#no-authentication-required[icon:unlock[type=fas]] Reconcile a JWT
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#POST# [uri]#/api/jwt/reconcile#
--

==== Request Headers

[.api]
[field]#X-Forwarded-For# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#::
The IP address of a client requesting authentication. If the IP address is provided it will be stored for login history of the user. It is
generally preferred to specify the IP address in the request body. If it is not provided in the request body this header value will be used

This API may be authenticated using a JWT or an API key. If using JWT authentication, the JWT owner and token owner must match. See link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication[Authentication] for examples of authenticating using a JWT. 

==== Request Parameters

[.api]
[field]#tokenId# [type]#[UUID]# [required]#Required#::
The Id of the refresh token to be revoked.
+
When deleting a single token, using this parameter is recommended. Using this parameter does not expose the refresh token.

[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#DELETE# [uri]#/api/jwt/refresh``?token=\{token\}``#
--

This API may be authenticated using a JWT or an API key. If using JWT authentication, the JWT owner and token owner must match. See link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication[Authentication] for examples of authenticating using a JWT. 

==== Request Parameters

[.api]
[field]#token# [type]#[String]# [required]#Required#::
The refresh token in string form that is to be revoked. This string may contain characters such as a plus sign that need to be encoded to be valid on the URL. If you're manually building this request ensure you are properly URL encoding this value.
+
You can also pass the refresh token in the HTTP body by specifying a Content-Type header of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and providing the proper URL encoded value for the parameter. This will prevent the refresh token from being written to HTTP access logs.
+
If possible, it is recommended use the [field]#tokenId# parameter rather than this one.

=== Response

This API does not return a JSON response body.

:no_errors:
include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_standard-delete-response-codes.adoc[]
:no_errors!:

== Validate a JWT

This API is used to validate a JSON Web Token. A valid JWT indicates the signature is valid and the payload has not be tampered with and the token is not expired.

You can also validate a JWT without using this API call. To do so, validate the JWT attributes and signature locally. Many programming languages have libraries to do this. Here's an https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-jwt#verify-and-decode-a-jwt-using-hmac[example in Java].

=== Request

[.api-authentication]
link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication#no-authentication-required[icon:unlock[type=fas]] Validate Access Token.
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#GET# [uri]#/api/jwt/validate#
--

The access token can be provided to the API using an HTTP request header, or a cookie. The response body will contain the decoded JWT payload.

==== Request Headers

[.api]
[field]#Authorization# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#::
The encoded JWT to validate sent in on the Authorization request header.
+
The header is expected be in the following form: `Authorization: Bearer <encoded_access_token>`.
+
See link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication[Authentication] for additional examples.

==== Request Cookies

[.api]
[field]#access_token# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#::
The encoded JWT. This cookie is written to the client by the Login API.

[cols="1,9"]
.Response Codes
|===
|Code |Description

|200
|The request was successful. The response will contain a JSON body.

|401
|The access token is not valid. A new access token may be obtained by authentication against the Login API, the Token Endpoint or by utilizing a Refresh Token.

|500
|There was an internal error. A stack trace is provided and logged in the FusionAuth log files. The response will be empty.
|===

==== Response Body

[.api]
[field]#jwt# [type]#[Object]#::
The decoded JWT payload. The payload contains the identity claims for the user.

== Vend a JWT

This API is used to create a free-form access token (JWT) with claims defined by the caller. The only "reserved" claims that cannot be specified are `exp` and `iat`. The `iat` claim is the issued at time of the JWT and the `exp` is the expiration time of the JWT as computed by adding to the `iat` value either the user passed [field]#timeToLiveInSeconds# or the tenant JWT [field]#timeToLiveInSeconds#. If a reserved claim is passed into the [field]#claims# object, it will be ignored.

[NOTE.note]
====
This API has been available since 1.30.0

==== Request Body

[.api]
[field]#claims# [type]#[Object]# [optional]#Optional#::
A set of claims to add to this JWT.  If any of the "reserved" claims, `exp` or `iat`, are specified they will be ignored. Otherwise, the claims can be any valid JSON value.

[field]#keyId# [type]#[UUID]# [optional]#Optional#::
The Id of the signing key to use when signing this JWT. If this is not supplied, the tenant's JWT access token signing key will be used.

[field]#timeToLiveInSeconds# [type]#[Integer]# [optional]#Optional#::
The length of time in seconds before the JWT expires and is no longer valid. Any integer value greater than `0` is allowed. If omitted, the tenant's [field]#timeToLiveInSeconds# value will be used instead.
