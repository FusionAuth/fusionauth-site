The issuer of the RSA or EC certificate. This field is omitted for HMAC key types.

[field]#key.kid# [type]#[String]#::
The key identifier 'kid'.

[field]#key.lastUpdateInstant# [type]#[Long]#::
The link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/data-types/#instants[instant] that the key was updated in the FusionAuth database.

[field]#key.length# [type]#[String]#::
The length  of the RSA or EC certificate. This field is omitted for HMAC key types.

[field]#key.name# [type]#[String]#::
The name of the key.

[field]#key.publicKey# [type]#[String]#::
