description: APIs for authenticating users (logging them in) or tracking an SSO login (login ping) and multi-factor authentication
---

== Overview

The following APIs are used to authenticate and track user logins.

* <<Authenticate a User>>
* <<Authenticate a User with a one time password>>
* <<Complete Multi-Factor Authentication>>
* <<Update Login Instant>>
* <<Logout a User>>

The following APIs allow you to search and export historical login records.

* <<Search Login Records>>
* <<Export Login Records>>

== Authenticate a User

The Login API is used authenticate a user in FusionAuth. The issuer of the One Time Password will dictate if a JWT or a Refresh Token may be issued in the API response.

=== Request

By default, this API will require API key authentication when called with an [field]#applicationId#. API key authentication may be disabled per Application, see [field]#application.loginConfiguration.requireAuthentication# in the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/applications/[Application API] or navigate to [breadcrumb]#Applications -> Edit -> Security# in the user interface.


Prior to version `1.5.0` this API did not accept an API key and never required authentication.

==== Request Headers

[.api]
[field]#X-Forwarded-For# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#::
The IP address of a client requesting authentication. If the IP address is provided it will be stored for login history of the user. It is
generally preferred to specify the IP address in the request body. If it is not provided in the request body this header value will be used
if available, the request body value will take precedence.
include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_x-fusionauth-tenant-id-header-scoped-operation-row-only.adoc[]

==== Request Cookies

[.api]
[field]#fusionauth.trust# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#::
The Multi-Factor Trust identifier returned by the Multi-Factor Login API response. This value be may be provided to bypass the Multi-Factor challenge when a User has Multi-Factor enabled. When this cookie exists on the request it will take precedence over the [field]#twoFactorTrustId# if provided in the request body.

==== Request Body

[.api]
[field]#applicationId# [type]#[UUID]# [optional]#Optional#::
include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_login-applicationId-parameter.adoc[]

[field]#ipAddress# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#::
The IP address of the end-user that is logging into FusionAuth. If this value is omitted FusionAuth will attempt to obtain the IP address of
the client, the value will be that of the `X-Forwarded-For` header if provided or the last proxy that sent the request. The IP address will
be stored in the User login history.

[field]#loginId# [type]#[String]# [required]#Required#::
The login identifier of the user. The login identifier can be either the [field]#email# or the [field]#username#.

include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_login-metadata-device.adoc[]

[field]#noJWT# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `false`#::
When this value is set to true a JWT will not be issued as part of this request. The response body will not contain the `token` or `refreshToken` fields, and the `access_token` and `refresh_token` cookies will not be written to the HTTP response.
+
This optional parameter may be helpful when performing high volume authentication requests and the JWT is not being utilized, in this scenario removing the additional latency required to issue and sign the JWT may have a measurable cumulative effect on performance.

[field]#password# [type]#[String]# [required]#Required#::
The user's password or an Application specific link:/docs/v1/tech/tutorials/application-authentication-tokens/[Authentication Token].

[field]#twoFactorTrustId# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#::
The Multi-Factor Trust identifier returned by the Multi-Factor Login API response. This value be may be provided to bypass the Multi-Factor challenge when a User has Multi-Factor enabled.

== Authenticate a User with a one time password

This API is used to login using a One Time Password that has been returned from the Change Password API. The login request is nearly identical, however the `oneTimePasswordId` will take the place of both the `loginId` and the `password` properties.

=== Request

Authentication may be disabled per Application, see [field]#application.loginConfiguration.requireAuthentication# in the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/applications/[Application API] or navigate to [breadcrumb]#Applications -> Edit -> Security# in the user interface.

== Update Login Instant

Sends a ping to FusionAuth indicating that the user has authenticated, and (optionally) automatically logged into an application.
When using FusionAuth's SSO or your own, you should call this if the user is already logged in centrally, but accesses an
application where they no longer have a session. This helps correctly track login counts, times and helps with reporting.
