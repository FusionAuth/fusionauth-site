[field]#application.samlv2Configuration.xmlSignatureLocation# [type]#[String]#  [default]#Defaults to `Assertion`# [since]#Available since 1.21.0#::
The location to place the XML signature when signing a successful SAML response.
+
The possible values are:
+
 * `Assertion` - The XML signature will be added as a child element of the Assertion.
 * `Response` - The XML signature will be added as a child element of the Response.
+
In most cases the default configuration will be adequate. If you encounter a SAML v2 Service Provider that requires the signature to be a child of the Response, use this configuration to change the signature location. Prior to version `1.21.0`, the XML signature was always located as a child element of the Assertion when the response was successful.

The unique Id of the theme to be used to style the login page and other end user templates.
