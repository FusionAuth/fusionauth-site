== Overview

This page contains the APIs that are used for manager user actions. This does not cover actually actioning users. Instead, this is the CRUD API for manage the user action definitions. Here are the APIs:

* <<Create a User Action>>
* <<Retrieve a User Action>>
* <<Update a User Action>>
* <<Delete a User Action>>
* <<Reactivate a User Action>>

=== Response

The response for this API contains either a single User Action or all of the User Actions. When you call this API with an Id the response will contain just that User Action. When you call this API without an Id the response will contain all of the User Actions. Both response types are defined below along with an example JSON response.
