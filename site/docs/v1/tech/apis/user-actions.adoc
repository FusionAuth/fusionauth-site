title: User Action APIs
description: APIs for creating, retrieving, updating and deleting user actions
---

== Overview

This page contains the APIs for managing user actions. This API does not cover actually actioning users. Instead, this is the CRUD API for manage the user action definitions. 

If you want to apply an existing user action to a user, see the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/actioning-users/[Actioning Users API].

Here are the APIs:

* <<Create a User Action>>
* <<Retrieve a User Action>>
* <<Update a User Action>>
* <<Delete a User Action>>
* <<Reactivate a User Action>>

=== Response

The response for this API contains either a single User Action or all of the User Actions. When you call this API with an Id the response will contain just that User Action. When you call this API without an Id the response will contain all of the User Actions. Both response types are defined below along with an example JSON response.
