|[field]#theme.templates.emailSend# [type]#[String]#
|A https://freemarker.apache.org[FreeMarker] template that is rendered when the user requests the /email/send page. This page is used after a user has asked for the verification email to be resent. This can happen if the URL in the email expired and the user clicked it. In this case, the user can provide their email address again and FusionAuth will resend the email. After the user submits their email and FusionAuth re-sends a verification email to them, the browser is redirected to this page.

|[field]#theme.templates.emailVerify# [type]#[String]#
|A https://freemarker.apache.org[FreeMarker] template that is rendered when the user requests the /email/verify page by clicking the URL from the verification email and the `verificationId` has expired. FusionAuth expires `verificationId` after a period of time (which is configurable). If the user has a URL from the verification email that has expired, this page will be rendered and the error will be displayed to the user.

|[field]#theme.templates.helpers# [type]#[String]#
|A https://freemarker.apache.org[FreeMarker] template that contains all of the macros and templates used by the rest of the `loginTheme` FreeMarker templates (i.e. `oauth2Authorize`).

|[field]#theme.templates.oauth2Authorize# [type]#[String]#

|[field]#theme.templates.oauth2ChildRegistrationNotAllowedComplete# [type]#[String]#

|[field]#theme.templates.oauth2CompleteRegistration# [type]#[String]#
|A https://freemarker.apache.org[FreeMarker] template that is rendered when the user requests the /oauth2/complete-registration page.  This page is used for users that have accounts but might be missing required fields.

|[field]#theme.templates.oauth2Error# [type]#[String]#
|A https://freemarker.apache.org[FreeMarker] template that is rendered when the user requests the /oauth2/error page. This page is used if the user starts or is in the middle of the OAuth workflow and any type of error occurs. This could be caused by the user messing with the URL or internally some type of information wasn't passed between the OAuth endpoints correctly. For example, if you are federating login to an external IdP and that IdP does not properly echo the `state` parameter, FusionAuth's OAuth workflow will break and this page will be displayed.

|[field]#theme.templates.oauth2Logout# [type]#[String]# [since]#Available Since 1.10.0#
|A https://freemarker.apache.org[FreeMarker] template that is rendered when the user requests the /oauth2/logout page. This page is used if the user initiates a logout. This page causes the user to be logged out of all associated applications via a front-channel mechanism before being redirected.

|[field]#theme.templates.oauth2Register# [type]#[String]#
|A https://freemarker.apache.org[FreeMarker] template that is rendered when the user requests the /oauth2/register page.  This page is used for users that need to register (sign-up)

|A https://freemarker.apache.org[FreeMarker] template that is rendered when the user requests the /oauth2/two-factor page.

|[field]#theme.templates.passwordChange# [type]#[String]#
|A https://freemarker.apache.org[FreeMarker] template that is rendered when the user requests the /password/change page.

|[field]#theme.templates.passwordComplete# [type]#[String]#
|A https://freemarker.apache.org[FreeMarker] template that is rendered when the user requests the /password/complete page. This page is used after the user has successfully updated their password (or reset it). This page should instruct the user that their password was updated and that they need to login again.

|[field]#theme.templates.passwordSent# [type]#[String]#
|A https://freemarker.apache.org[FreeMarker] template that is rendered when the user requests the /password/sent page. This page is used when a user has submitted the forgot password form with their email. FusionAuth does not indicate back to the user if their email address was valid in order to prevent malicious activity that could reveal valid email addresses. Therefore, this page should indicate to the user that if their email was valid, they will receive an email shortly with a link to reset their password.

|[field]#theme.templates.registrationComplete# [type]#[String]#
|A https://freemarker.apache.org[FreeMarker] template that is rendered when the user requests the /registration/complete page.

|[field]#theme.templates.registrationSend# [type]#[String]#
|A https://freemarker.apache.org[FreeMarker] template that is rendered when the user requests the /registration/send page. This page is used after a user has asked for the application specific verification email to be resent. This can happen if the URL in the email expired and the user clicked it. In this case, the user can provide their email address again and FusionAuth will resend the email. After the user submits their email and FusionAuth re-sends a verification email to them, the browser is redirected to this page.

|[field]#theme.templates.registrationVerify# [type]#[String]#
|A https://freemarker.apache.org[FreeMarker] template that is rendered when the user requests the /registration/verify page by clicking the URL from the application specific verification email and the `verificationId` has expired.
