[field]#{parameter_prefix}name# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#::
The case-insensitive string to search for in the Application name. This can contain wildcards using the asterisk character (`*`). If no wildcards are present, this parameter value will be interpreted as `pass:[*value*]`.

[field]#{parameter_prefix}numberOfResults# [type]#[Integer]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `25`#::
The number of results to return from the search.

[field]#{parameter_prefix}orderBy# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `name ASC`#::
The database field to order the search results as well as an order direction.
+
The possible values are:
+
 * `id` - the unique Id of the Application
 * `insertInstant` - the link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/data-types#instants[instant] when the Application was created
 * `name` - the Application name
 * `tenant` - the name of the Tenant in which the Application belongs
+
The order direction is optional. Possible values of the order direction are `ASC` or `DESC`. If omitted, the default sort order is `ASC`.
+
For example, to order the results by the insert instant in a descending order, use `insertInstant DESC`.

[field]#{parameter_prefix}startRow# [type]#[Integer]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `0`#::
The offset into the total results. In order to paginate the results, increment this value by the [field]#numberOfResults# for subsequent requests.
+
For example, if the total search results are greater than the page size designated by [field]#numberOfResults#, set this value to `25` to retrieve results `26-50`, assuming the default page size.

[field]#{parameter_prefix}state# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#::
Filters on the state of the Application. Can be omitted to retrieve both active and inactive Applications.
+
The possible values are:
+
* `Active` - The Application is active.
* `Inactive` - The Application is not active. An Application can not be modified or authenticated against when inactive.

[field]#{parameter_prefix}tenantId# [type]#[UUID]# [optional]#Optional#::
Restricts the results to Applications belonging to the given Tenant. This parameter will be overridden if the request contains an `X-FusionAuth-TenantId` header, or if the supplied API key is scoped to a specific Tenant.
