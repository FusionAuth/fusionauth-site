[field]#{parameter_prefix}name# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#::
The case-insensitive string to search for in the Application name. This can contain wildcards using the asterisk character (`*`). If no wildcards are present, the search criteria will be interpreted as `pass:[*value*]`. If this field is omitted, no filtering will be applied to the `name` field.

[field]#{parameter_prefix}numberOfResults# [type]#[Integer]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `25`#::
The number of results to return from the search.

[field]#{parameter_prefix}orderBy# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `name ASC`#::
The database field to order the search results as well as an order direction.
+
The possible values are:
+
 * `id` - the UUID of the Application
 * `insertInstant` - the link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/data-types#instants[instant] when the Application was created
 * `name` - the Application name
 * `tenant` - the name of the Tenant in which the Application belongs
+
The order direction is optional. Possible values of the order direction are `ASC` or `DESC`. If omitted, the default sort order is `ASC`.
+
For example, to order the results by the insert instant in a descending order, use `insertInstant DESC`.
[field]#{parameter_prefix}startRow# [type]#[Integer]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `0`#::
The offset row to return results from. If the search has 200 records in it and this is 50, it starts with row 50. In order to paginate the results, increment this value by the [field]#numberOfResults# for subsequent requests.

[field]#{parameter_prefix}state# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#::
Filters on the state of the Application. Can be omitted to retrieve both active and inactive Applications.
+
The possible values are:
+
* `Active` - The Application is active.
* `Inactive` - The Application is not active. An Application can not be modified or authenticated against when inactive.

[field]#{parameter_prefix}tenantId# [type]#[UUID]# [optional]#Optional#::
Restricts the results to Applications belonging to the given Tenant. This parameter will be overridden if the request contains an `X-FusionAuth-TenantId` header, or if the supplied API key is scoped to a specific Tenant.
