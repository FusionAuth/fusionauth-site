* <<Create a User Action Reason>>
* <<Retrieve a User Action Reason>>
* <<Update a User Action Reason>>

== Create a User Action Reason

This API is used to create an User Action Reason. Specifying an Id on the URI will instruct FusionAuth to use that Id when creating the User Action Reason. Otherwise, FusionAuth will generate an Id for the User Action Reason.

== Retrieve a User Action Reason

This API is used to retrieve one or all of the configured User Action Reasons. Specifying an Id on the URI will retrieve a single User Action Reason. Leaving off the Id will retrieve all of the User Action Reasons.

=== Request

=== Response

The response for this API contains either a single User Action Reason or all of the User Action Reasons. When you call this API with an Id the response will contain just that User Action Reason. When you call this API without an Id the response will contain all of the User Action Reasons. Both response types are defined below along with an example JSON response.
