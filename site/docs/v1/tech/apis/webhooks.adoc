== Overview

A FusionAuth Webhook is intended to consume JSON events emitted by FusionAuth. Creating a Webhook allows you to tell
FusionAuth where you would like to receive these JSON events.

Webhooks provides a publish  - subscribe style integration with FusionAuth. Creating a Webhook is the subscribe portion
of this common messaging pattern. If you're already using Kafka for consuming messages in your infrastructure, see our
link:/docs/v1/tech/integrations/kafka[Kafka] integration as well.

These APIs that are used to manage Webhooks.

== Create a Webhook

This API is used to create a Webhook. Specifying an Id on the URI will instruct FusionAuth to use that Id when creating the Webhook. Otherwise, FusionAuth will create a Id for the Webhook automatically.

=== Request

[.api-authentication]
link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[type=fas]] Create a Webhook without providing an Id. An Id will be automatically generated.

[.api-authentication]
link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[type=fas]] Create a Webhook with the given Id.
[.endpoint]
.URI

== Retrieve a Webhook

This API is used to retrieve one or all of the configured Webhooks. Specifying an Id on the URI will retrieve a single Webhook. Leaving off the Id will retrieve all of the Webhooks.

=== Request

[.api-authentication]
link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[type=fas]] Retrieve all of the Webhooks
[.endpoint]
.URI

==== Request Parameters

[.api]
[field]#webhookId# [type]#[UUID]# [optional]#Optional#::
The Id of the Webhook to retrieve.

=== Response

The response for this API contains either a single Webhook or all of the Webhooks. When you call this API with an Id the response will contain just that Webhook. When you call this API without an Id the response will contain all of the Webhooks. Both response types are defined below along with an example JSON response.
