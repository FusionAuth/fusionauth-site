== Overview

A FusionAuth Webhook is intended to consume JSON events emitted by FusionAuth. Creating a Webhook allows you to tell
FusionAuth where you would like to receive these JSON events.

Webhooks provides a publish  - subscribe style integration with FusionAuth. Creating a Webhook is the subscribe portion
of this common messaging pattern. If you're already using Kafka for consuming messages in your infrastructure, see our
link:../integrations/kafka[Kafka] integration as well.

These APIs that are used to manage Webhooks.
