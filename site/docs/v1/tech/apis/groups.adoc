title: Group APIs
description: APIs for creating, retrieving, updating and deleting groups
---

== Overview

A FusionAuth Group is a named object that optionally contains one to many Application Roles.

When a Group does not contain any Application Roles it can still be utilized to logically associate users. Assigning Application Roles to a group allow it to be used to dynamically manage Role assignment to registered Users. In this second scenario as long as a User is registered to an Application the Group membership will allow them to inherit the corresponding Roles from the Group.

The following APIs are provided to manage Groups and Group Membership.

* <<Create a Group>>
* <<Retrieve a Group>>
* <<Update a Group>>
* <<Delete a Group>>
* <<Add Users to a Group>>
* <<Update Users in a Group>>
* <<Remove Users from a Group>>
* <<Search for Group Members>>

== Delete a Group

This API is used to permanently delete a Group. Deleting a Group that has Application Roles will effectively modify User Registrations by removing these Roles from Group members.

=== Request

[.api-authentication]
link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[type=fas]] Delete a Group by Id
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#DELETE# [uri]#/api/group/`\{groupId\}`#
--

==== Request Parameters

[.api]
[field]#groupId# [type]#[UUID]# [required]#Required#::
The unique Id of the Group to delete.

include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_x-fusionauth-tenant-id-header-scoped-operation.adoc[]

=== Response

This API does not return a JSON response body.

include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_standard-delete-response-codes.adoc[]

== Add Users to a Group

This API is used to add Users to a Group. A User that is added to a Group is called a member, a user can belong to one to many Groups.

Adding a User to a Group can be used to logically group users, Group members can be returned by the Search API by searching by the Group Id. Application Roles may also be managed by a Group membership. When a User becomes a member of a Group they will inherit the Application Roles assigned to the Group for their registered Applications. If a User is not registered for an Application the Application Roles for that Application will not be applied to the User.

=== Request

[.api-authentication]
link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[type=fas]] Add Users to Group
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#POST# [uri]#/api/group/member#

== Update Users in a Group

[NOTE.since]
====
This API has been available since 1.36.0
====

This API is used to completely replace the existing membership of a Group. Calling this API is equivalent to removing all Users from a Group and then making a `POST` request to the `/api/group/member` to add Users to the Group. Use this API with caution.

=== Request

== Search for Group Members

[NOTE.since]
====
This API has been available since 1.36.0
====

The Group Member Search API allows you to search for Group Members with a paginated response.

=== Request

[.api-authentication]
link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[type=fas]] Search for all Group Members by Group Id
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#GET# [uri]#/api/group/member/search``?groupId=\{groupId\}``#
--

When calling the API using a `GET` request you will send the search criteria on the URL using request parameters. In order to simplify the example URL above, only the `groupId` parameter is shown, however you may add any of the documented request parameters to the URL.

==== Request Parameters

[.api]
[field]#groupId# [type]#[UUID]# [optional]#Optional#::
The unique Id of the Group used to search for Group Members.

[field]#numberOfResults# [type]#[Integer]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `25`#::
The number of results to return from the search.

[field]#orderBy# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `name ASC`#::
The database column to order the search results on plus the order direction.
+
The possible values are:
+
  * `id` - the id of the Group Member
  * `insertInstant` - the link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/data-types#instants[instant] when the Group Member was created
  * `groupId` - the unique Id of the Group
  * `userId` - the unique Id of the User
+
For example, to order the results by the insert instant in descending order, the value would be provided as `insertInstant DESC`. The final string is optional, can be set to `ASC` or `DESC`, or omitted and will default to `ASC`.

[field]#startRow# [type]#[Integer]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `0`#::
The offset row to return results from. If the search has 200 records in it and this is 50, it starts with row 50.

[field]#userId# [type]#[UUID]# [optional]#Optional#::
The unique Id of the User to search for Group Members. A single user may belong to one or more Groups, so searching on this field may still produce multiple results.
