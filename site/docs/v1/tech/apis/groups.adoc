== Overview

A FusionAuth Group is a named object that optionally contains one to many Application Roles.

When a Group does not contain any Application Roles it can still be utilized to logically associate users. Assigning Application Roles to a group allow it to be used to dynamically manage Role assignment to registered Users. In this second scenario as long as a User is registered to an Application the Group membership will allow them to inherit the corresponding Roles from the Group.

The following APIs are provided to manage Groups and Group Membership.

* <<Create a Group>>
* <<Retrieve a Group>>
* <<Update a Group>>
* <<Delete a Group>>
* <<Add Users to a Group>>
* <<Remove Users from a Group>>

== Update a Group

This API is used to update an existing Group. You must specify the Id of the Group you are updating on the URI. You must specify all of the properties of the Group when calling this API. This API does not merge the existing Group and your new data. It replaces the existing Group with your new data.

[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#PUT# [uri]#/api/group/`\{groupId\}`#
--

[NOTE.since]

[.endpoint]
--
[method]#PATCH# [uri]#/api/group/`\{groupId\}`#

== Delete a Group

This API is used to permanently delete a Group. Deleting a Group that has Application Roles will effectively modify User Registrations by removing these Roles from Group members.

=== Request

[.api-authentication]
link:authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[role=red]] Delete a Group by Id
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#DELETE# [uri]#/api/group/`\{groupId\}`#

[.api]
.Request Parameters
|===
|[field]#groupId# [type]#[UUID]# [required]#Required#
|The unique Id of the Group to delete.
|===

=== Response

This API does not return a JSON response body.

== Add Users to a Group

This API is used to add Users to a Group. A User that is added to a Group is called a member, a user can belong to one to many Groups.

Adding a User to a Group can be used to logically group users, Group members can be returned by the Search API by searching by the Group Id. Application Roles may also be managed by a Group membership. When a User becomes a member of a Group they will inherit the Application Roles assigned to the Group for their registered Applications. If a User is not registered for an Application the Application Roles for that Application will not be applied to the User.

=== Request

[.api-authentication]
link:authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[role=red]] Add Users to Group
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#POST# [uri]#/api/group/member#
