description: The APIs for creating, retrieving, updating and deleting Applications
---

== Overview

This page contains the APIs that are used to manage Applications as well as the Roles of an Application. Here are the APIs:

* <<Create an Application>>
* <<Retrieve an Application>>
* <<Update an Application>>
* <<Delete an Application>>
* <<Search for Applications>>
* <<Reactivate an Application>>
* <<Create an Application Role>>
* <<Update an Application Role>>
* <<Delete an Application Role>>
* <<Retrieve OAuth Configuration>>

== Create an Application

This API is used to create an Application. Specifying an Id on the URI will instruct FusionAuth to use that Id when creating the Application. Otherwise, FusionAuth will generate an Id for the Application.

=== Request

[.api-authentication]
link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[type=fas]] Create an Application with a generated Id
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#POST# [uri]#/api/application#
--

include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_x-fusionauth-tenant-id-header-create-operation.adoc[]

[.api-authentication]
link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[type=fas]] Create an Application with the given Id
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#POST# [uri]#/api/application/`\{applicationId\}`#
--

==== Request Parameters

[.api]
[field]#applicationId# [type]#[UUID]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to a generated UUID#::
The Id to use for the new Application. If not specified a secure random UUID will be generated.

:includeRoles:
include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_application-request-body.adoc[includeRoles=true]
:includeRoles!:

=== Response

The response for this API contains the information for the Application that was created.

include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_application-response-body.adoc[]


== Retrieve an Application

This API is used to retrieve one or all of the configured Applications. Specifying an Id on the URI will retrieve a single Application. Leaving off the Id will retrieve all of the Applications.

=== Request

[.api-authentication]
link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[type=fas]] Retrieve all of the active Applications
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#GET# [uri]#/api/application#
--

include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_x-fusionauth-tenant-id-header-scoped-operation.adoc[]

[.api-authentication]
link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[type=fas]] Retrieve all of the inactive Applications
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#GET# [uri]#/api/application``?inactive=true``#
--

==== Request Parameters

[.api]
[field]#inactive# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional#::
Set this parameter to `true` in order to retrieve only inactive Applications. Setting this parameter to `false` is equivalent omitting the `inactive` parameter.

include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_x-fusionauth-tenant-id-header-scoped-operation.adoc[]

[.api-authentication]
link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[type=fas]] Retrieve a single Application by Id
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#GET# [uri]#/api/application/`\{applicationId\}`#
--

==== Request Parameters

[.api]
[field]#applicationId# [type]#[UUID]# [optional]#Optional#::
The Id of the Application to retrieve. This request will return the Application if it exists regardless if the Application is active or not.

include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_x-fusionauth-tenant-id-header-scoped-operation.adoc[]

=== Response

The response for this API contains either a single Application or all of the Applications. When you call this API with an Id the response will contain just that Application. When you call this API without an Id the response will contain all of the Applications. Both response types are defined below along with an example JSON response.

== Update an Application

:capitalized_object_name: Application
include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_generic-update-explanation-fragment.adoc[]
:capitalized_object_name!:

[NOTE]
====
You can't update an Application's roles via this API. This prevents you from accidentally removing all the roles of an Application. To create, update or remove a role from the Application, you need to call one of these APIs:

* <<Create an Application Role>>
* <<Update an Application Role>>
* <<Delete an Application Role>>
====

This API is used to search for Applications and may be called using the `GET` or `POST` HTTP methods. Examples of each are provided below. The `POST` method is provided to allow for a richer request object without worrying about exceeding the maximum length of a URL. Calling this API with either the `GET` or `POST` HTTP method will provide the same search results given the same query parameters.

* `name` - the Application name
* `tenant` - the id of the Tenant in which the Application belongs
+
For example, to order the results by the insert instant in a descending order, the value would be provided as `insertInstant DESC`. The final string is optional can be set to `ASC` or `DESC`.

[field]#startRow# [type]#[Integer]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `0`#::
The offset row to return results from. If the search has 200 records in it and this is 50, it starts with row 50.
