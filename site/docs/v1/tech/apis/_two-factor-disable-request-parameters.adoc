An application Id. This parameter is optional, and when provided it will cause application specific configuration to be used when available.

For example, to use an application specific email template to notify the user when multi-factor has been enabled, this parameter will be required. When this parameter is omitted, the tenant configuration will be used.

To learn more about overriding email templates, see the link:/docs/v1/tech/guides/configuring-application-specific-email-templates[Application Specific Email Templates] guide.

This may also be a recovery code. If one is provided, all methods are removed. If, after that, a multi-factor method is added, a new set of recovery codes will be generated.

[field]#methodId# [type]#[String]# [required]#Required#::
The Id of the multi-factor method to be disabled.

If a recovery code is provided, this can be any valid method Id.
