[field]#tenant.webAuthnConfiguration.relyingPartyId# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to **[see description]**# [since]#Available since 1.41.0#::
The value this tenant will use for the Relying Party Id in WebAuthn ceremonies. Passkeys can only be used to authenticate on sites using the same Relying Party Id they were registered with. This value must match the browser origin or be a registrable domain suffix of the browser origin. For example, if your domain is `auth.piedpiper.com`, you could use `auth.piedpiper.com` or `piedpiper.com` but not `m.auth.piedpiper.com` or `com`.
+
When this parameter is omitted, FusionAuth will use `null` for the Relying Party Id in passkey creation and request options. A `null` value in the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API[WebAuthn JavaScript API] will use the browser origin.
