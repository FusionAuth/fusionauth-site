While there is underlying support for different code lengths, algorithms and time steps, at the current time the system only allows for the following TOTP settings:

[cols="1,1"]  
|=== 
|Configuration setting | Currently allowed value

|`authenticator.algorithm`
|`HmacSHA1`

|`authenticator.codeLength`
|`6`

|`authenticator.timeStep`
|`30`

|=== 

Any attempt to change these configuration values will currently be ignored. 

If you need different configuration settings, please file a https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-issues/issues[GitHub issue detailing your use case].
