[field]#sendSetPasswordEmail# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `false`#::
If `true`, FusionAuth will send the User an email asking them to set their password. The Email Template that is used is the one specified in the [field]#setPasswordEmailTemplateId# {set_password_field_config_blurb}.
+
When you set this value to `true`, any provided [field]#password# field is ignored. FusionAuth will set the initial password to a securely generated random string.
+
If you have also enabled email verification and do not skip verification with the [field]#skipVerification# parameter, only the setup password email will be sent to the user. Setting up the password using the email sent during this user create operation will verify the User's email if it is not already verified.
+
If the SMTP email configuration is not complete, or disabled, this value is ignored.
