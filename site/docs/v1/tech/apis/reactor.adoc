== Retrieve Reactor metrics

This API is used to retrieve the metrics of Reactor features.

=== Request

[.api-authentication]
link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[type=fas]] Retrieve Reactor metrics
[.endpoint]
.URI

== Retrieve Reactor status

This API is used to retrieve the status of Reactor features.

=== Request

[.api-authentication]

== Regenerate Reactor license

This API is used to make requests from FusionAuth to the License server to regenerate a license. This is particularly useful if it is suspected that the license key has been compromised and a new one is needed.

Regenerating the license will cause any other instance using the license to revert to community edition features. All configuration will be maintained, but any paid edition functionality will be disabled. The instance of FusionAuth that makes this API request will be updated to use the new license key, but each additional instance requiring a license will need the updated license key.

=== Request

[.api-authentication]
link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication#api-key-authentication[icon:lock[type=fas]] Regenerate a Reactor license
[.endpoint]
.URI
--
[method]#PUT# [uri]#/api/reactor#
--

=== Response

This API does not return a JSON response body.

:never_search_error:
:success_code: 200
:success_message: The request was successful. The response will be empty.

== Deactivate Reactor license

This API is used to deactivate a Reactor license.
If link:/docs/v1/tech/guides/breached-password-detection/[Breached Password Detection] was being used it will no longer work, licensed features can no longer be enabled, and existing configurations may no longer work if they use licensed features.

=== Request
