== Overview

This tutorial guides you through the basics of registering users and logging them into Applications using the FusionAuth APIs as well as some alternatives.


== Register a User

In order to register a User, you must have first created an Application.  A tutorial for creating an application is provided in the link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/applications[Application overview]. Once the Application has been created, you are ready to call the API to register a User.


There are two APIs that can be used to create the User and then create a Registration for that User in the Application you create. In most cases you will want to create the User and register them in a single step. This can be accomplished by calling the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/registrations#create-a-user-and-registration-combined[/api/user/register (combined) API].

However, you can also create the User and then register them for the Application in separate API calls. This method would make use of the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/users#create-a-user[/api/user API] followed by a call to the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/registrations#create-a-user-registration-for-an-existing-user[/api/user/register (for an existing user) API]. We recommend using the single API call, but in some cases, calling the APIs separately is preferred.

You can also allow accounts to be created with link:/docs/v1/tech/guides/basic-registration-forms[self-service registration]. With this approach, Fusionauth hosts the registration forms and pages.

== Log in a User

Once you have create a User and registered them for an Application, you can authenticate them by calling the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/login[Login API]. That will return a JWT and other User information as documented.

A user can also log in via the link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/integration-points/#hosted-login-pages[hosted login pages]. These use the Authorization Code grant or a SAML flow. FusionAuth owns the user interface for authentication in this scenario.

== Should I Use the APIs or The FusionAuth Hosted Login Pages

In general the hosted login pages are recommended. They are link:/docs/v1/tech/themes/[customizable and localizable with themes] and when used, FusionAuth is the only server side system to see sensitive user information like credentials. In other words, you are delegating authentication entirely to FusionAuth.

They also include a number of common workflows, including, but not limited to:

include::docs/v1/tech/shared/_list-hosted-login-pages-use-cases.adoc[]

The reason to use the APIs is to give you full control over the workflow, user experience, and look and feel of your login and registration functionality. Reasons include:

* You don't want to use a webview for authentication on a mobile application.
* You need a custom user registration flow not supported by FusionAuth, such as directing a user to different registration flows based on their email address.
* You have an existing application that already handles login and you want to continue to use it as the "front door" to your app.
