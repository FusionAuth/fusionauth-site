## Integrate Your {{page.technology}} Application With FusionAuth

{% include docs/integration/_intro.md %}

## Prerequisites

{% include docs/integration/_prerequisites.md %}

## Download and Install FusionAuth

{% include docs/integration/_install-fusionauth.md %}

## Create a User and an API Key

{% include docs/integration/_add-user.md language=page.language %}

## Configure FusionAuth

Next, you need to set up FusionAuth. This can be done in different ways, but weâ€™re going to use the Typescript client library. The below instructions use `npm` on the command line, but you can use the client library with an IDE of your preference as well.

First, make a directory:

```shell
mkdir setup-fusionauth && cd setup-fusionauth
```

Now, copy and paste the following file into `package.json`.

```javascript
{% remote_include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-client-libraries/main/typescript/package.json %}
```

Now you need to install the dependencies in `package.json`.

```shell
npm install
```

Then copy and paste the following file into `setup.js`. This file uses the [FusionAuth API](/docs/v1/tech/apis/) to configure an Application, CORS and more to allow for easy integration. 

```javascript
{% remote_include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-client-libraries/main/typescript/setup.js %}
```

Then, you can run the setup script.

```shell
fusionauth_api_key=YOUR_API_KEY_FROM_ABOVE npm run setup
```

If you want, you can http://localhost:9011[login to your instance] and examine the new Application the script created for you.

## Create Your {{page.technology}} Application

Now you are going to create a {{page.technology}} application. While this section uses a simple {{page.technology}} application, you can use the same steps to integrate any {{page.technology}} application with FusionAuth.

First, make a directory:

```shell
mkdir ../setup-react && cd ../setup-react
```

Next, create a simple {{page.technology}} template using vite. Using this lets you easily integrate FusionAuth. For a production application you'll probably use something like [NextJS or Remix](/docs/quickstarts/#single-page-app).

```shell
npm create vite@latest react-app -- --template react
```

Now, change into the `react-app` directory and install the needed packages.

```shell
cd react-app && npm install
```

You can start up the server and visit the URL displayed to ensure the default application works.

```shell
npm run dev
```

You'll want to open another terminal window to continue. Edit `src/App.jsx` to make changes to the view to test out the automatic reloading.

{% capture callout_content %}If you are using a different port than 5173 for your {{page.technology}} app, update the redirect URL in the setup script, or modify it manually. It needs to match.{% endcapture %}
{% include _callout-tip.liquid content=callout_content %}

Now, let's install the [FusionAuth React SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fusionauth/react-sdk).

```shell
npm install @fusionauth/react-sdk
```

Update `src/main.jsx` to wrap your app with `FusionAuthProvider`. This file should look similar to this, but make sure you update the attributes of the provider if you modify the port:

```jsx
{% remote_include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-react-guide/main/src/main.jsx %}
```

Now, let's add a login and logout button to your {{page.technology}} application. Open up `src/App.jsx` and replace the content with the following:

```jsx
{% remote_include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-react-guide/main/src/App.jsx %}
```

In this code, you are adding in the FusionAuth login and logout buttons, as well as a welcome message which will only show up if the user is logged in.

## Test It Out

You can now open up an incognito window and visit [the {{page.technology}} app](http://localhost:5173). View the page and log in with the user you configured. If you used the setup script, it will be `richard@example.com`.

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/docs/quickstarts/react/react-app.png" alt="The sample React application." class="img-fluid" figure=true %}

You've successfully added login and logout to a React application.

You now have an access token safely stored as a cookie. Any requests you make to an API on the same domain will receive the access token. The API can then validate the token and return data or otherwise offer functionality.

TODO update to point to an API that looks for a JWT in the correct cookie
