== Prometheus Setup

[NOTE.since]

Available since `1.26.0`

Prometheus is a tool to monitor metrics and setup alerts in the case that some metric has responded negatively for an extended period.

include::docs/v1/tech/apis/_prometheus-jvm-gauges.adoc[]

=== Setup
Setting this up with FusionAuth is easy. The only requirement to hookup FusionAuth is to direct Prometheus to the FusionAuth Prometheus endpoints. We used the following configuration for a FusionAuth instance running locally on the docker host. (You can reach docker host ip via `host.docker.internal` on mac and windows docker.)

== Configuration
The Prometheus endpoint is configured with the YAML file. You can learn more about the Prometheus configuration link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#[here]. Prometheus does not provide functionality to authenticate using custom HTTP headers. As a workaround, we are using API key as password using "basic auth" authorization method.

In order to authenticate using basic auth please use string "apikey" as the username and a valid API key as the password. The API key must have `GET` permission for the `/api/prometheus/metrics` endpoint.

All other configuration is standard Prometheus scrape_config.

Please refer to the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication#[Authentication] document for more details about API keys.
