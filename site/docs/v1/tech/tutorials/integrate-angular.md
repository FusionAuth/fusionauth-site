## Prerequisites

{% include docs/integration/_prerequisites.md %}

## Download and Install FusionAuth

{% include docs/integration/_install-fusionauth.md %}

## Create a User and an API Key

{% include docs/integration/_add-user.md language=page.language %}

## Configure FusionAuth

Next, you need to set up FusionAuth. This can be done in different ways, but we are going to use the {{page.language}} client library. The instructions below use `npm` on the command line, but you can use the client library with an IDE of your preference as well.

First, make a directory:

```shell
mkdir setup-fusionauth && cd setup-fusionauth
```

Now, copy and paste the following code into `package.json`.

```javascript
{% remote_include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-client-libraries/main/typescript/package.json %}
```

Now you need to install the dependencies in `package.json`.

```shell
npm install
```

Then copy and paste the following code into `setup.js`. This file uses the [FusionAuth API](/docs/v1/tech/apis/) to configure an Application, CORS, and more to allow for easy integration.

```javascript
{% remote_include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sonderformat-llc/fusionauth-example-client-libraries/angular/typescript/setup-angular.js %}
```

Then, you can run the setup script.

```shell
fusionauth_api_key=YOUR_API_KEY_FROM_ABOVE node setup.js
```

{% include _callout-note.liquid content="The setup script is designed to run on a newly installed FusionAuth instance with only one user and no tenants other than `Default`. To follow this guide on a FusionAuth instance that does not meet these criteria, you may need to modify the above script. <br><br> Refer to the [Typescript client library](/docs/v1/tech/client-libraries/typescript) documentation for more information." %}

If you are using PowerShell, you will need to set the environment variable in a separate command before executing the script.

```shell
$env:fusionauth_api_key='YOUR_API_KEY_FROM_ABOVE'
node setup.js
```

If you want, you can [log into your instance](http://localhost:9011) and examine the new Application the script created for you.

## Create Your {{page.technology}} Application

Now you are going to create an {{page.technology}} application. While this section uses a simple {{page.technology}} application, you can use the same steps to integrate any {{page.technology}} application with FusionAuth.

First, create a simple {{page.technology}} template using `@angular/cli`. Using this lets you easily integrate FusionAuth.

```shell
npx -p @angular/cli ng new setup-angular --defaults
```

You can start up the server and visit the URL displayed to ensure the default application works.

```shell
cd setup-angular
npx ng serve
```

You will want to open another terminal window to continue. Edit `src/app/app.component.html` to make changes to the view to test out the automatic reloading.

{% capture callout_content %}If you are using a different port than 4200 for your {{page.technology}} app, update the redirect URL in the setup script, or modify it manually. It needs to match.{% endcapture %}
{% include _callout-tip.liquid content=callout_content %}

Now, let's install the [FusionAuth Angular SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fusionauth/angular-sdk).

```shell
npm install @fusionauth/angular-sdk
```

Add the following to `src/app/app.module.ts` to import the FusionAuth Angular SDK. This file should look similar to this, but make sure you update the attributes of the provider if you modify the port:

```typescript
{% remote_include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sonderformat-llc/fusionauth-example-angular-guide/main/src/app/app.module.ts %}
```

Now, let us add a login, register, and logout button to your {{page.technology}} application. Open up `src/app/app.component.html` and replace the content with the following:

```html
{% remote_include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sonderformat-llc/fusionauth-example-angular-guide/main/src/app/app.component.html %}
```

Then, replace the content of `src/app/app.component.ts` with the following code:

```typescript
{% remote_include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sonderformat-llc/fusionauth-example-angular-guide/main/src/app/app.component.ts %}
```

In this code, you are adding in the FusionAuth login and logout buttons, as well as a welcome message which will only show up if the user is logged in.

## Testing the Authentication Flow

You can now open up an incognito window and visit [the {{page.technology}} app](http://localhost:4200). View the page and log in with the user you configured.

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/docs/quickstarts/angular/angular-app.png" alt="The sample Angular application." class="img-fluid" figure=true %}

You have successfully added login, register, and logout to an Angular application.

You now have an access token safely stored as a cookie. Any requests you make to an API on the same domain will receive the access token. The API can then validate the token and return data or otherwise offer functionality.
