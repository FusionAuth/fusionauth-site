As of version 1.16.0, FusionAuth has the concept of a search engine type. There are two valid values:

* `database`
* `elasticsearch`

They have different link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/users#user-search[strengths and limitations]. This tutorial walks you through the process of changing your FusionAuth search engine. Reasons for doing so vary. You may be simplifying your deployment strategy with the database search engine. Or perhaps you need the advanced searching options of Elasticsearch after your application has grown. Either way, it's an easy switch.

== Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you are running version 1.16.0 or greater.

If you aren't, head on over to the link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/[installation guide] or the link:/docs/v1/tech/admin-guide/upgrade[upgrade guide].

Because there are a variety of ways to run FusionAuth, this guide won't document how to start or stop your FusionAuth instance. Please consult the installation specific documentation for instructions on how to start or stop it.

== Overview

To switch the search engine, you need to do the following:

* Stop FusionAuth
* Modify the FusionAuth configuration
* Start FusionAuth
* Reindex (if switching from the database search engine to Elasticsearch)

FusionAuth can be configured in a number of ways, outlined in the link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/configuration[Configuration Reference], including environment variables and the `fusionauth.properties` file. This tutorial modifies the `fusionauth.properties` file, but adapting the instructions to your configuration method should be straight forward.

== From Elasticsearch to Database

The first step is to stop FusionAuth.

Locate your FusionAuth configuration file named `fusionauth.properties`. This is usually located at `/usr/local/fusionauth/config/fusionauth.properties` unless you installed via Fast Path, in which case it is located in your service root.

Add or update the `fusionauth-app.search-engine-type` key to have the value `database`. 
```
fusionauth-app.search-engine-type=database
```

Optionally, comment out or remove any properties prefixed with `fusionauth-search.` as well as the `fusionauth-app.search-servers` property. If not removed, these will be ignored.

Restart the FusionAuth application.

=== Verify the change

Log into the FusionAuth admin UI. Navigate to [breadcrumb]#System -> About# and look at the `System` panel. This will show the new value for your search engine: `Database`.

You can also navigate to [breadcrumb]#Users# and search for a user by email address or first name to confirm that you can search.

== From Database to Elasticsearch 

If you already have FusionAuth running, but need to install the search service, link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/fusionauth-search[here are instructions to do so].

Once you have Elasticsearch running, the next step is to stop FusionAuth.

Locate your FusionAuth configuration file named `fusionauth.properties`. This is usually located at `/usr/local/fusionauth/config/fusionauth.properties` unless you installed via Fast Path, in which case it is located in your service root.

Uncomment or add the `fusionauth-app.search-servers` property. Set it to point to your Elasticsearch servers. For example:

```
fusionauth-app.search-servers=http://localhost:9021
```

In addition, add or update the `fusionauth-app.search-engine-type` property to have the value `elasticsearch`.

```
fusionauth-app.search-engine-type=elasticsearch
```

Finally, add or uncomment and update any properties prefixed by `fusionauth-search` needed for your installation. These are all documented in the link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/configuration[Configuration Reference].

Restart the FusionAuth application.

=== Verify the change and reindex

Log in to the FusionAuth admin UI. Navigate to [breadcrumb]#System -> About# and look at the `System` panel. This will show the new value for your search engine: `Elasticsearch`.

You'll also want to reindex by navigating to [breadcrumb]#System -> Reindex#. This will initialize the search index and synchronize it with your database. Reindexing may take some time, depending on the number of users you have and the amount of custom data to be indexed.

Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Users# and search for a user by email address, first name or other attribute to confirm that the search engine is working. You'll also notice that the advanced search form elements are also present.
