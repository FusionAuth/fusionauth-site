== Integrate Your {technology} Application With FusionAuth

In this article, you are going to learn how to integrate a {technology} application with FusionAuth.

Here's a typical application login flow before integrating FusionAuth into your {technology} application..

++++
{% plantuml source: _diagrams/docs/login-before.plantuml, alt: "Login before FusionAuth." %}
++++

And here's the same application login flow when FusionAuth is introduced.
++++
{% plantuml source: _diagrams/docs/login-after.plantuml, alt: "Login with FusionAuth." %}
++++


== Prerequisites

For this tutorial, you’ll need to have {prequisites} installed. You'll also need Docker, since that is how you’ll install FusionAuth.

== Download and Install FusionAuth

First, make a project directory:

[source,shell]
----
mkdir integrate-fusionauth && cd integrate-fusionauth
----

Then, install FusionAuth:

[source,bash]
----
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/docker-compose.yml
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/docker-compose.override.yml
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/.env
docker-compose up -d
----

== Create a User and an API Key

Next, http://localhost:9011[log into your FusionAuth instance].
You’ll need to set up a user and a password, as well as accept the terms and conditions.

Then, you’re at the FusionAuth admin UI.
This lets you configure FusionAuth manually.
But for this tutorial, you're going to create an API key and then you’ll configure FusionAuth using our {language} client library.

Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> API Keys#. Click the [uielement]#+# button to add a new API Key.
Copy the value of the [field]#Key# field and then save the key.
It might be a value like `CY1EUq2oAQrCgE7azl3A2xwG-OEwGPqLryDRBCoz-13IqyFYMn1_Udjt`.

Doing so creates an API key that can be used for any FusionAuth API call.
Save that key value off as you’ll be using it later.

== Configure FusionAuth

Next, you need to set up FusionAuth.
This can be done in different ways, but we’re going to use the {language} client library.
The below instructions use maven from the command line, but you can use the client library with an IDE of your preference as well.

First, make a directory:

[source,shell]
----
mkdir setup-fusionauth && cd setup-fusionauth
----

If you want, you can http://localhost:9011[login to your instance] and
examine the new application configuration the script created for you.

Now, cut and paste the following file into `pom.xml`.

[source,xml,title="Your FusionAuth configuration pom.xml"]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-client-libraries/main/java/pom.xml[]
----

Then make the directory for your setup class:

[source,shell]
----
mkdir -p src/main/java/io/fusionauth/example
----

Then copy and paste the following code into the
`src/main/java/io/fusionauth/example/Setup.java` file.

[source,java]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-client-libraries/main/java/src/main/java/io/fusionauth/example/Setup.java[]
----

Then, you can run the setup class. This will create FusionAuth
configuration for your Spring application.

[source,shell]
----
mvn compile && mvn exec:java \
  -Dexec.mainClass="io.fusionauth.example.Setup" \
  -Dfusionauth.api.key=<your API key>
----

== Create Your Spring Application

Now you are going to create a Spring application. While this section uses a
simple Spring application, you can use the same configuration to
integrate your Spring application with FusionAuth.

First, make a directory:

[source,shell]
----
mkdir ../setup-spring && cd ../setup-spring
----

Then, install the following files in these locations.

Put a `pom.xml` file at the top level. Here are the contents of this
file:

[source,xml,title="Your Spring pom.xml file"]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-java-spring/main/pom.xml[]
----

Then, you need to create two directories:

[source,shell]
----
mkdir -p src/main/resources/templates && \
mkdir -p src/main/java/io/fusionauth/example/spring/config
----

Paste the below into `src/main/resources/application.properties`. This is mostly the OAuth configuration you need.

[source,properties]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-java-spring/main/src/main/resources/application.properties[]
----

Then put this HTML in the `src/main/resources/templates/home.html` file.
This is going to be the page unauthenticated users see.

[source,html]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-java-spring/main/src/main/resources/templates/home.html[]
----

Add this HTML in the `src/main/resources/templates/user.html` file.
This is going to be the page authenticated users can access. This will
only show a JSON representation of the user, but you could put other
protected information in this page.

[source,html]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-java-spring/main/src/main/resources/templates/user.html[]
----

Then, you need to add the {language} files that comprise your Spring
application. There are four:

* An application startup class
* A configuration class
* Two controllers for the pages you added above

Let’s add the startup file first. In
`src/main/java/io/fusionauth/example/spring/FusionAuthSpringApplication.java`,
put this code:

[source,java]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-java-spring/main/src/main/java/io/fusionauth/example/spring/FusionAuthSpringApplication.java[]
----

Next, the configuration class. In
`src/main/java/io/fusionauth/example/spring/config/SecurityConfiguration.java`,
put this code:

[source,java]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-java-spring/main/src/main/java/io/fusionauth/example/spring/config/SecurityConfiguration.java[]
----

Finally, create the home and user controllers which back the HTML templates above.

Here’s the home controller, which should live in
`src/main/java/io/fusionauth/example/spring/HomeController.java`,
which should contain this code:

[source,java]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-java-spring/main/src/main/java/io/fusionauth/example/spring/HomeController.java[]
----

Here’s the profile controller, which should live in
`src/main/java/io/fusionauth/example/spring/UserController.java`. It
should have this code:

[source,java]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-java-spring/main/src/main/java/io/fusionauth/example/spring/UserController.java[]
----

At the end, your directory tree should look like: 

[source]
----
├── docker-compose.yml
├── setup-fusionauth
│   ├── pom.xml
│   └── src
│       └── main
│           └── java
│               └── io
│                   └── fusionauth
│                       └── example
│                           └── Setup.java
└── setup-spring
    ├── pom.xml
    └── src
        └── main
            ├── java
            │   └── io
            │       └── fusionauth
            │           └── example
            │               └── spring
            │                   ├── FusionAuthSpringApplication.java
            │                   ├── HomeController.java
            │                   ├── UserController.java
            │                   └── config
            │                       └── SecurityConfiguration.java
            └── resources
                ├── application.properties
                └── templates
                    ├── home.html
                    └── user.html
----

Once you’ve created this directory structure, you can start up the Spring application using this command: 

[source,shell,title="Start the application"]
----
mvn spring-boot:run
----

You can now open up an incognito window and visit http://localhost:8080[the Spring app].
Log in using the user you added in FusionAuth, and you’ll see a JSON output of your profile on the profile page.
