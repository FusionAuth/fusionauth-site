FusionAuth Docker containers can be used with Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Helm or OpenShift. The following example is using DOcker Compose but you may find links and examples for kubernetes, Helm and OpenShift in the https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers[FusionAuth Containers] GitHub repo.

== Docker Compose

All of the FusionAuth Docker images may be found on https://hub.docker.com/u/fusionauth/[Docker Hub].

If you're looking for a complete configuration to get up and running quickly, use our Docker Compose example.  The reference `docker-compose.yml` will install FusionAuth without the enhanced search capability that Elasticsearch provides.  If you would like to install FusionAuth including Elasticsearch for improved search capability, include the reference `docker-compose.override.yml` in the install steps below.

The following are examples and may not be the most recent version. Refer to the following link in https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/blob/master/docker/fusionauth[GitHub] to find the latest version of our reference configuration.

=== FusionAuth
In this example, we will download the `docker-compose.yml` and the `.env` files and then start up the configured containers.

[source]
----
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/docker-compose.yml
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/.env
docker-compose up
----

=== FusionAuth with Elasticsearch
In this example, we will download the `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.override.yml` and the `.env` files and then start up the configured containers.

[source]
----
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/docker-compose.yml
curl -o docker-compose.override.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/docker-compose.override.yml
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/.env
docker-compose up
----

The stock `.env` file will contain the following values, you will want to modify the `DATABASE_PASSWORD` and ensure the `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` values are correct. You may also override any of these values using environment variables.

```
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
# Prior to version 1.19.0, using DATABASE_USER
# DATABASE_USER=fusionauth
# >= 1.19.0, using DATABASE_USERNAME
DATABASE_USERNAME=fusionauth
DATABASE_PASSWORD=hkaLBM3RVnyYeYeqE3WI1w2e4Avpy0Wd5O3s3

ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m

# Prior to version 1.19.0, using FUSIONAUTH_MEMORY
# FUSIONAUTH_MEMORY=512M
# >= 1.19.0, using FUSIONAUTH_APP_MEMORY
FUSIONAUTH_APP_MEMORY=512M
```

=== Docker Compose Examples

==== FusionAuth
The following is an example `docker-compose.yml` file configuring FusionAuth without the Elasticsearch engine. For the most recent version of this example find this file on https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/blob/master/docker/fusionauth[GitHub].
```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:11.9-alpine
    environment:
      PGDATA: /var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
      POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
# Un-comment to access the db service directly
#    ports:
#      - 5432:5432
    networks:
      - db
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:

```

==== FusionAuth with Elasticsearch
The following is an example `docker-compose-override.yml` which may be included in your working directory next to the above `docker-compose.yml` to install and configure Elasticsearch. For the most recent version of this example find this file on https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/blob/master/docker/fusionauth[GitHub].
```yaml
version: '3'

services:

  search:
    image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.8.1
    environment:
      cluster.name: fusionauth
      bootstrap.memory_lock: "true"
      discovery.type: single-node
      ES_JAVA_OPTS: ${ES_JAVA_OPTS}
    # Un-comment to access the search service directly
    # ports:
    #  - 9200:9200
    #  - 9300:9300
    networks:
      - search
    restart: unless-stopped
    ulimits:
      memlock:
        soft: -1
        hard: -1
    volumes:
      - es_data:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data

  fusionauth:
    depends_on:
      - search
    environment:
      SEARCH_TYPE: elasticsearch
      SEARCH_SERVERS: http://search:9200
    networks:
      - search

networks:
  search:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  es_data:
```

== Configuration
Review the link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/configuration/[Configuration - Environment Variables] documentation to customize your deployment.

== Docker Services
In the above example configurations you will find a database, search and FusionAuth service. Read below to better understand how each service is configured.

=== Database Service

At a minimum, you wil need to either set the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variable in the `db` service section, or more ideally set the value in the host environment and leave it out of the `docker-compose.yml` file. Ensure the other properties fit your requirements. Refer to the link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/system-requirements/[System Requirements] for database version support.

=== Search Service

We currently support Elasticsearch versions 6.3.x - 7.6.x.  Later versions may works as well, but may not have been tested for compatibility.  Please let us know if you have a requirement for a different version of Elasticsearch. The remainder of the properties can be changed to whatever you need.

== Production Deployment

Elasticsearch has a few runtime requirements that may not be met by default on your host platform. Please review the Elasticsearch Docker production mode guide for more information.

* https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.6/docker.html#docker-cli-run-prod-mode

For example if startup is failing and you see the following in the logs, you will need to increase `vm.max_map_count` on your host VM.

== Upgrading

To upgrade FusionAuth when running with `docker-compose`:

. Stop the instance: `docker-compose down`.
. Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file (or the `docker-compose.override.yml` file, if applicable) to point to the version of FusionAuth you want. You can see https://hub.docker.com/r/fusionauth/fusionauth-app[available tags].
. Start it up: `docker-compose up`.
. Login to the administrative UI. 

=== Migrations

If there were database migrations required, what happens on an upgrade depends on two settings: the runtime mode and the silent mode.

[NOTE]
====
Prior to version 1.19, migration behavior was different. See below for more.
====

If silent mode is set to `true`, then database migrations will automatically be performed.

If silent mode is `false` and the runtime mode is set to `development`, then the link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/fusionauth-app/#maintenance-mode[maintenance mode screen] will pop up and you will be prompted to complete the migrations there. 

In all other cases the migrations will not be applied, and you'll have to perform them yourself. If you want to manage your own database upgrades, performing the SQL migrations out of band with another tool or process is a good option.

[cols="2a,2a,5a"]
.When Are Database Migrations Applied
|===
|Runtime Mode|Silent Mode|Migration Behavior

|`development`
|`true`
|Migration applied automatically

|`development`
|`false`
|Maintenance mode UI displayed, user prompted to run migrations

|`production`
|`true`
|Migration applied automatically

|`production`
|`false`
|Migration never applied by FusionAuth, must be applied out of band
|===

See the link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/configuration/[configation reference] or the link:/docs/v1/tech/guides/silent-mode/[silent mode guide] for more information. To apply the database migrations out of band see the link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/upgrade/#database[database upgrade] documentation.

==== Prior to 1.19

If the installation is in `production` mode, apply the migrations out of band. 

When running in development runtime mode, silent mode was enabled based upon the presence of environment variables, such as the database user, and could not explicitly be enabled or disabled. 

=== Docker tags

The docker compose file references the `latest` tag, but that tag is not dynamic, it is only the latest at a point in time. To get the most recently released image, you have a couple of options.

* You can edit the docker compose file with an explicit tag version. This is a good idea for a production deployment.
* You can remove the old image first, as otherwise the latest image won't be used: `docker rmi <old image id>`. This command may prompt you to remove containers using that image. Since all state is stored in the database, you can safely remove the containers.
* You can pull the latest image with this command: `docker pull fusionauth/fusionauth-app:latest`.

== Docker Images

If you want to build your own image starting with our base image, the following Docker image is available.

=== FusionAuth App

```
docker pull fusionauth/fusionauth-app
```

== Kickstart

Using Docker with Kickstart is a powerful combination. Using these technologies together lets you:

* Configure and share development environments
* Create replicable bug reports 
* Spin up auth instances with a well known, versioned set of data for continuous integration and testing

All the normal limitations of Kickstart apply (the Kickstart will not run if the database has already been set up with an API key, for example).

It's easy to get started with Kickstart, but you'll need to tweak your Docker Compose files a bit. Before you being, you'll need a valid `kickstart.json` file. Note that this file could be called anything, `kickstart.json` is simply a convention. Check out the link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/kickstart/[Kickstart documentation] for more information on writing one.

Once you have a valid `kickstart.json` file, create a subdirectory in the location of your `docker-compose.yml` file. It can be named anything; this documentation will use a directory called `kickstart`. Next, you'll mount this directory and set the `FUSIONAUTH_APP_KICKSTART_FILE` variable in the `docker-compose.yml` file. 

Here are the steps to do so:

* In the `volumes:` section of the `fusionauth` service, add `- ./kickstart:/usr/local/fusionauth/kickstart`
* Modify `.env` and add the Kickstart configuration variable: `FUSIONAUTH_APP_KICKSTART_FILE=/usr/local/fusionauth/kickstart/kickstart.json`. The path refers to what the docker container expects.
* Configure `docker-compose.yml` to pass the environment variable set by `.env` into the container. Do this by adding `FUSIONAUTH_APP_KICKSTART_FILE: ${FUSIONAUTH_APP_KICKSTART_FILE}` to the `environment` section of the `fusionauth` service. 

The following is an example `docker-compose.yml` file configuring FusionAuth to use a `kickstart.json` at startup. 

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:9.6
    environment:
      PGDATA: /var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
      POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
# Un-comment to access the db service directly
#    ports:
#      - 5432:5432
    networks:
      - db
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  fusionauth:
    image: fusionauth/fusionauth-app:latest
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/fusionauth
      DATABASE_ROOT_USERNAME: ${POSTGRES_USER}
      DATABASE_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
      DATABASE_USERNAME: ${DATABASE_USERNAME}
      DATABASE_PASSWORD: ${DATABASE_PASSWORD}
      FUSIONAUTH_APP_MEMORY: ${FUSIONAUTH_MEMORY}
      FUSIONAUTH_APP_RUNTIME_MODE: development
      FUSIONAUTH_APP_URL: http://fusionauth:9011
      SEARCH_TYPE: database
      FUSIONAUTH_APP_KICKSTART_FILE: ${FUSIONAUTH_APP_KICKSTART_FILE}
    networks:
     - db
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 9011:9011
    volumes:
      - fa_config:/usr/local/fusionauth/config
      - ./kickstart:/usr/local/fusionauth/kickstart

networks:
  db:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  db_data:
  fa_config:
```

== Accessing the Host

The default FusionAuth docker configuration sets up the network using the `bridge` configuration.

This means that all the hosts defined by `docker-compose` can access each other. However, it means that any applications running on your host cannot be accessed by FusionAuth.

This is typically only an issue when FusionAuth is trying to access outside resources, such as sending email or requesting a webhook.

In that case, the recommended course of action is to either:

* Host your application inside the same docker network or
* Run FusionAuth on the host machine, using FastPath or other installation mechanisms

Modifying FusionAuth to use other Docker networking schemes such as `host` may work, but isn't fully tested or supported.
