System upgrades require downtime. This is typically on the order of seconds to minutes. In general, the process for upgrading is:

* Take down all nodes
* Upgrade the database schema by running the migrations
* Upgrade the FusionAuth application and (if required) Elasticsearch packages
* Start all FusionAuth nodes

The recommendation is that you automate the process and minimize downtime. For our FusionAuth cloud hosted solutions we use a configuration management tool and see downtime on the order of seconds.

There's an https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1240[open issue for zero downtime upgrades]. Please vote that up if this is important to you.
