If you receive a message similar to this one:

[source]
----
ERROR io.fusionauth.api.service.system.NodeService - Node [c98263dc-7f12-4879-93c1-f1a634912a51] cannot be added. The runtime mode is [Development] and this node in [Production] mode.
----

This means that your nodes are in different modes. This will not work and may cause undetermined behavior.

To resolve this issue, terminate the existing nodes with the mismatched runtime modes, confirm that all nodes are configured with the same runtime mode, and restart the nodes.
