== Overview

FusionAuth Cloud is an entirely managed FusionAuth instance in the cloud. As the owner of that server, you have complete access to the administrative user interface and can create API keys and manage the instance via client libraries or APIs. But you have no access to the servers or networks where the instance runs.

With FusionAuth Cloud, you create "deployments".
A deployment is a FusionAuth instance, a database, a search application, and all the necessary networking configuration to connect your FusionAuth deployment to the internet.

You can create as many deployments as you want and tear them down when you do not need them. You pay only for the time each deployment is running.

Every deployment is separated, both logically and physically, from every other deployment.
There is no network path between deployments except over the internet.
There is no shared database or other storage infrastructure.

== Why Use FusionAuth Cloud

FusionAuth Cloud is a fully managed service which can be used for many use cases. Among them:

* Proof of concepts
* FusionAuth trials
* Testing new versions without affecting prod
* Development servers
* High availability production environments

With FusionAuth Cloud, spin up a functioning FusionAuth instance in minutes.
This allows you to get to work testing or integrating with FusionAuth, rather than installing or configuring it.
FusionAuth Cloud is protected by world class security measures and DDoS protections.

If you want to use FusionAuth and hand all the management burden to the team who built it, FusionAuth Cloud is a good choice.

== What Does FusionAuth Cloud Cost

Unlike other installation options, **FusionAuth Cloud costs money**.
You cannot create a FusionAuth Cloud deployment without a credit card or invoicing agreement.

For full pricing information as well as different deployment architectures, visit link:/pricing[the pricing page, window="_blank"].

=== The Pricing Calculator

You can also find the expected cost without creating an account by using the link:https://account.fusionauth.io/price-calculator[pricing calculator, window="_blank"].
You can choose the cloud option, the deployment region, and the number of monthly active users.

By clicking [breadcrumb]#Add Service# and then [breadcrumb]#Add Deployment# you can add a deployment.

image::installation-guides/cloud/pricing-calculator.png[The pricing calculator.,width=1200]

You can modify attributes of your deployment, including the level, the location and the size.
You'll be able to see the total price before you are charged anything. Here's an example of the deployment creation screen.

image::installation-guides/cloud/pricing-calculator-add-deployment.png[Adding a deployment.,width=1200]

== The Account Portal

You can control all aspects of FusionAuth Cloud deployments by logging into the link:https://account.fusionauth.io/[account portal, window="_blank"].

=== Portal Areas

include::docs/v1/tech/admin-guide/_account-sections-overview.adoc[]

include::docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/_cloud-user-note.adoc[]

You can read more about the other portal areas in the link:/docs/v1/tech/admin-guide/account-portal[Account Portal] documentation.

== Setting Up Your Account

include::docs/v1/tech/admin-guide/_setting-up-portal-account.adoc[]

If you are paying with a credit card, you will receive a payment receipt to the email address you signed up with.
If you need the receipt to go to a different address, you can update details in the [breadcrumb]#Billing# tab.
You will also be able to find past invoices there as well.

The following section focuses on deployments and the actions available in the [breadcrumb]#Deployments# tab.
Learn more about the link:/docs/v1/tech/admin-guide/account-portal[other portal areas here].

After you have created an account, the next step is to create a deployment.

== Creating a Deployment

As mentioned above, a deployment is a FusionAuth instance that is operated by FusionAuth.
You can create as many deployments as you like.
There are a few steps to getting access to a deployment.

Navigate to the [breadcrumb]#Deployments# tab.
If you have no deployments, you will see a screen like this:

image::installation-guides/cloud/deployments-tab-no-deployments.png[On the Deployments tab with no deployments.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Click the "Launch Today" button to start your first FusionAuth Cloud deployment.

=== Billing Issues

If you are on invoice billing, you cannot launch a FusionAuth cloud deployment.
You'll see a screen like this:

image::installation-guides/cloud/deployments-tab-invoiced.png[On the Deployments tab with invoicing set up after trying to launch.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

In this situation, please https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support[file a support ticket] to modify your billing status or request a new deployment.

=== Configuring Your Deployment

In order to create the correct FusionAuth instance, specify attributes of the deployment.

First, enter a description and the hostname of the deployment.
You must provide a unique hostname for the deployment, such as `piedpiper-dev`.
This hostname will be suffixed with the `fusionauth.io` domain name.
If your plan supports it, you will be able to configure a different hostname, such as `auth.piedpiper.com`.
If you need to reuse an existing hostname or migrate data from an existing deployment, open a https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/[support ticket].

Choose the version you want to run; the default is the latest release at the time of deployment creation.

image::installation-guides/cloud/provisioning-add-details.png[Add details for provisioning.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Next, pick the type of this deployment: Basic, Business or High-Availability (HA).
Each has different features and data durability guarantees.

image::installation-guides/cloud/provisioning-select-type.png[Selecting your desired type on the provisioning screen.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Next, choose your region and size.
Supported regions include:

* North America
* Europe
* Asia Pacific
* South America
* the Middle East

Within each region, select a geographic area, such as Oregon, USA.
Pick the location that meets your legal and compliance needs and is close to your applications.

Next, pick the deployment size. This section includes guidance on how many logins per second can be supported. There are three sizes available:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Size | Expected logins or registrations per second

| Medium | 1-10 
| Large | 10-50
| X-Large | 50-150
|===

If you have needs for more requests per second, please see <<Custom FusionAuth Cloud Features>> for other options.

image::installation-guides/cloud/provisioning-select-region-size.png[Choosing your region and size.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

You'll see a price at the bottom of the screen.

This price will update as you change attributes of your deployment.

image::installation-guides/cloud/provisioning-price-summary.png[Your price summary.,width=1200,role=top-cropped]

[NOTE]
====
The screenshots above are for a Basic FusionAuth Cloud deployment.

Different deployments will show different options. 
====

When you have your deployment configured as you would like, click [field]#Add to Cart#.
You will then be presented with a summary page, which will show your current information as well as any changes to be made.
You may add more than one deployment if you wish.

image::installation-guides/cloud/provisioning-purchase.png[Provisioning purchase section.,width=1200]

Scroll to the bottom and click [field]#Purchase# to begin the deployment creation process.
This will also charge your credit card.

If you do not have a payment method on file, add one in the [breadcrumb]#Billing# tab.

=== Deployment Provisioning

Navigate to the [breadcrumb]#Deployments# tab to see the new deployment.

The exact duration of the deployment process depends on system load as well as the tier chosen.
Expect your deployment to be available in 5 to 30 minutes.
When the deployment is ready, the link to your deployment will be live and the [breadcrumb]#Deployments# tab will look similar to this:

image::installation-guides/cloud/deployments-active.png[Deployment tab when the provisioning finished.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

=== Accessing the FusionAuth UI

Log in to the deployment's administrative user interface by clicking on the deployment's URL, such as `\https://piedpiper-dev-ha-may.fusionauth.io`.

At that point the link:/docs/v1/tech/tutorials/setup-wizard[Setup Wizard] will begin.
You can configure FusionAuth by creating API keys, adding additional users, setting up applications for your users to log in to, or any other task.
The interface will be exactly the same as a self hosted FusionAuth instance.

If new to FusionAuth, you might want to work through the link:/docs/v1/tech/5-minute-setup-guide#5-create-an-application-and-configure-the-oauth-settings[5 minute guide], starting at step 5, and updating the FusionAuth instance URL to point to your deployment.

You'll also want to update various system or tenant level settings.
This includes creating API keys, updating your email host settings and configuring groups and roles.
This guide to link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/common-configuration[Common configuration] is helpful at this point.

[NOTE]
====
Many infrastructure or network providers don't allow any traffic on port 25.
This includes FusionAuth Cloud.

We recommend using one of the TLS ports for SMTP, such as 465 or 587.
FusionAuth will work with any email provider which has a SMTP interface.
====

== Managing Your Deployments

At any time you can log in to the account portal, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Deployments# and manage your deployments.

To add another deployment, click [field]#Add deployment#.
You'll go through the same provisioning workflow as above, and end up with another FusionAuth Cloud deployment.

image::installation-guides/cloud/deployments-launch-deployment.png[Launch deployment button,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

You can also upgrade or destroy each deployment.
To begin either process, select the menu under [field]#Action#:

image::installation-guides/cloud/deployments-manage.png[Manage deployment,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

== Upgrading a Deployment

If your deployment is not running the latest version of FusionAuth, you may upgrade it.
It is a good idea to run the latest released version of FusionAuth, which has the latest bug fixes, security updates, and features.

However, you will not be forced to upgrade on a certain schedule.
Upgrades are optional and controlled by you.

[NOTE]
====
Upgrade management is only available if the deployment is not currently running the latest released FusionAuth version. 
====

=== Upgrade Duration

This upgrade process takes between 5 minutes and 60 minutes of time.
The exact duration of system downtime depends on the type of deployment, amount of data in your system, and database changes required by the version upgrade.

.Upgrade Durations in FusionAuth Cloud
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| Hosting Option | Duration of Upgrade | Expected Downtime 

|Basic Cloud
|5 to 60 minutes
|5 to 60 minutes

|Business Cloud
|5 to 60 minutes
|5 to 60 minutes

|HA Cloud
|5 to 60 minutes
|seconds

|===

HA has a drastically lower downtime because the system has two nodes. 
They are upgraded one at a time and can continue to receive traffic during the upgrade. 

=== Upgrade Considerations

Consult the link:/docs/v1/tech/release-notes[relevant release notes] for functional changes.
Such changes may require updates or modifications to your code, whether to take advantage of new features or, occasionally, to handle changes in FusionAuth functionality.

Due to the downtime, it is recommended that you schedule the upgrade for a low traffic period.
Test the upgrade process on development or test servers first.

[NOTE]
====
The upgrade process described in this section updates the version of FusionAuth. 

If you are looking to modify other attributes of your deployment, such as the region it is running in, the deployment size, or the service tier, review the <<Modifying Deployments>> section.
====

=== Upgrade Process

To upgrade a deployment from version `1.x-1` to version `1.x`:

* Test `1.x` on a staging or development environment.
* Select a time that works for your users, your team, and your applications.
* https://account.fusionauth.io/[Log into your account].
* Record the time you began the upgrade.
* Navigate to the [breadcrumb]#Deployments# tab. Manage the deployment, then choose the "Upgrade" option. Select `1.x` from the [field]#Version# dropdown.
* Confirm you want to start the upgrade.

image::installation-guides/cloud/deployments-upgrade-confirm.png[Upgrading a deployment,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

* After confirmation, the deployment will be in an "Upgrading" state until finished. Monitor the upgrade by viewing the [breadcrumb]#Deployments# tab. To programmatically monitor the upgrade, call the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/system#retrieve-system-status[System Status API].
* The upgrade to version `1.x` is complete when the user interface deployment has a status of "Active", or when the System Status API returns success.

[WARNING.warning]
====
You cannot downgrade a FusionAuth Cloud deployment version.

Please test upgrades before performing them on your production system.
====

=== Rolling Back From a Problematic Upgrade

If an upgrade is problematic, and you identify the issue during the timeframe of your plan's backup retention period, open a https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/[support ticket] to restore your data to the previous version.

In the support ticket, please provide:

* The version you were upgrading from.
* The time the upgrade began so that the correct backup can be restored.

== Destroying a Deployment

If you have a FusionAuth deployment and want to delete it, do so by https://account.fusionauth.io/[logging into your account].

[WARNING.warning]
====
Before destroying a deployment, ensure you back up your user data and configuration. You can retrieve your configuration using the APIs.

See <<Accessing User Data>> for more about retrieving user data and passwords.

For Business and High Availability plans, FusionAuth will retain a backup for a maximum of 30 days.

For Basic plans, no backup is available.
====

Navigate to the [breadcrumb]#Deployments# tab.
Click the [field]#Action# button.
Choose the [field]#Delete# option.

image::installation-guides/cloud/deployments-prepare-destroy.png[Begin the process of destroying a deployment.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

You will be prompted to confirm your decision.

image::installation-guides/cloud/delete-deployment-confirm.png[Confirming the deployment destruction.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

After confirmation, the deployment will transition to the "Destroying" state.

image::installation-guides/cloud/deployments-destroying.png[The deployment is being destroyed,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

After the deployment is completely removed, it will have a "Destroyed" state on the [breadcrumb]#Deployments# tab.
At this point you will no longer be charged for this deployment.

== Migrating Data From a Deployment

FusionAuth can be run in a variety of environments, but you may want to migrate between them because:

* You want to let the FusionAuth team operate your auth server.
* You started out in FusionAuth Cloud but now want to run the software on internal systems for performance, compliance or control.
* You started out running FusionAuth locally for cost reasons, but now have launched and want to have someone else run it for you.

You can migrate the user data FusionAuth holds for you in a number of ways:

* From a self-hosted FusionAuth instance to a FusionAuth Cloud deployment.
* From a FusionAuth Cloud deployment to a self-hosted FusionAuth instance.
* From a different auth provider into FusionAuth.
* Away from FusionAuth to a different auth provider.

If you are interested in migrating to FusionAuth from an auth system other than FusionAuth, check out the link:/docs/v1/tech/migration-guide/[Migration Guide].

If you want to retrieve your user data from FusionAuth Cloud in order to migrate to a different auth provider, see <<Accessing User Data>>.
To get user data from a self-hosted FusionAuth instance, query the database.

=== Migrating To FusionAuth Cloud

To migrate from a self-hosted instance to FusionAuth Cloud:

* You must be running PostgreSQL. If you are running MySQL, please migrate to a PostgreSQL database locally. Here's a link:https://fusionauth.io/community/forum/topic/985/migrating-from-mysql-to-postgresql[forum post on how to do this]. This has been provided by the community and is not supported nor endorsed by FusionAuth.
* Export your FusionAuth database to a file. When you run the `pg_dump` command, please use the following options: `--format=c` and `--compress 9` to minimize the file size.
* Encrypt the export file with a symmetric solution such as gpg.
* Purchase a FusionAuth Cloud deployment that meets your needs. Select the version of FusionAuth that is the same as your local installation. You will be able to upgrade FusionAuth later; see <<Upgrading a Deployment>> for more.
* https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/[Open a support ticket] and provide the database export file, the version of PostgreSQL you are running, and the name of the new FusionAuth deployment.
* Provide the password for the database export through another channel. You can mention the channel you'd prefer in the support ticket. Slack, email and a separate support ticket are all options.

Within 1-2 business days, we will upload your data to your FusionAuth Cloud deployment.

After your data is uploaded, upgrade your deployment to any subsequent FusionAuth version, if desired. See <<Upgrading a Deployment>> for more.

|===


=== Migrating Away From FusionAuth Cloud

To migrate from FusionAuth Cloud to a self-hosted instance, please request a database export, as documented in <<Accessing User Data>>.
After you have the data, install it in a PostgreSQL database and configure your self-hosted instance to point to that database. 

Ensure your self-hosted instance uses the same FusionAuth and database versions as those used by your Cloud deployment.
You can view your FusionAuth version in the administrative user interface. 

To find your deployment's database version: 

* If you are running a version of FusionAuth before 1.30.2, https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support[open a support ticket].
* If running a version >= 1.30.2, navigate to [breadcrumb]#System -> About# to view the version.

Once you've tested your self-hosted installation, destroy your FusionAuth Cloud deployment as outlined in <<Destroying a Deployment>>.

== Modifying Deployments

Modifying certain aspects of a deployment, such as the region, requires assistance from the FusionAuth team.
This is in contrast with upgrading the version of FusionAuth your deployment is running, which is a self-serve operation described in <<Upgrading a Deployment>>.

Please open a https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/[support ticket] to change any of the following attributes of your deployment:

* the type
* the region or geographic location
* the size
* the hostname

These changes are typically handled in 1-2 business days.

=== Data Integrity

A common question is: "will I lose any data when migrating between tiers, region, size, or hostname?"

When performing any change which requires modifying cloud infrastructure, the cloud database is backed up, and then reconnected to the new infrastructure.

No data loss should occur and your configuration will be preserved.

== Custom Domains

If you are on a supported deployment and want a custom domain name such as `auth.piediper.com`, it is entirely self service.
The number of custom domain names you can have depends on the type of deployment.

First, log into your account portal.
Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Deployments#.
Then, choose the [field]#Action# dropdown and select `Custom URL(s)`.

image::installation-guides/cloud/custom-url-action.png[Navigating to the custom URLs domain entry screen.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

If you have existing custom URLs, you'll see them here.
To add one, click [field]#Update custom URL(s)#.

image::installation-guides/cloud/custom-url-update.png[The custom URLs list screen.,width=1200]

Add the domain names to [field]#Custom domains# field; for example, `auth.piedpiper.com`.
Confirm you want the change by entering the text `CONFIRM` in the [field]#Confirm# text field.
Then click [field]#Submit#.

image::installation-guides/cloud/custom-url-add-domains.png[Adding custom URLs.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

You'll be sent to a verification screen.
This screen will update as the proper DNS records and other infrastructure are created.

image::installation-guides/cloud/custom-url-verification-instructions.png[Pending verification instructions screen.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

After a few minutes, you'll be shown a set of records which you'll have to add to your DNS.

Custom domains are currently only offered for Business and HA Cloud deployments.
If you are using Basic Cloud, upgrade to a supported type to enable a custom domain name.

== Accessing User Data

If you need to export user data from FusionAuth Cloud, because you are migrating away from FusionAuth or setting up a production instance in your data center, open a https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/[support ticket]. Your data is yours!

A support request is required because data exports contain sensitive fields, like password hashes. The FusionAuth team will work with you to find a safe data transfer mechanism.

If you need to download user data regularly for analytics or other purposes, consider using the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/users[User API] or a link:/docs/v1/tech/events-webhooks/[webhook] to track ongoing account creation. Be aware that performing such operations as downloading all users in your account can impact performance; if possible, pull a subset of users, such as those who have been created in the last week.

If these solutions do not meet your needs and you have an Enterprise edition, open a https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/[support ticket] to discuss options for regular data exports.

[NOTE.note]
====
If you need your user data because you are migrating off of FusionAuth Cloud, it's yours and we'll get it to you. This applies to any level of hosting and edition.

If you need your data exported regularly for any other reason, this is only available to organizations on Enterprise plans.

In either case, please open a support ticket to discuss options.
====

=== Restoring From Backup

Certain FusionAuth Cloud tiers include regular backups. If you need to restore your user database from a backup, open a https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/[support ticket] with the details.

You can restore to any point in time in the last three days. In the ticket, provide the date and time and timezone to which you'd like to restore your database.

== Support

You can view support options by navigating to the [breadcrumb]#Support# tab:

image::admin-guide/account-portal/support-tab.png[The support tab,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Support for FusionAuth Cloud is limited in scope.
Support can only help with issues related to running your FusionAuth Cloud deployments. Some examples:

* "My FusionAuth Cloud instance is down" - **supported**
* "Please restore my FusionAuth Cloud instance from backup" - **supported**
* "I need help integrating FusionAuth into my Express/Rails/Django/Spring/etc application" - **not supported**
* "How do I set up a webhook to sync my user data with an external system?" - **not supported**

Support from the engineering team for integrating with FusionAuth can be link:/pricing[purchased separately].

If you have out of scope questions and have not purchased a support contract, you can find community support in the link:/community/forum/[forums] and link:/docs/v1/tech/[documentation].

== Custom FusionAuth Cloud Features

If managed FusionAuth hosting does not meet your needs, link:/contact[contact us] with more details.

We're happy to discuss custom deployment architectures or configurations. If you need any of these:

* Longer retention of database backups.
* Static IP addresses capable of being added to a firewall allow/deny list.
* Deployments capable of handling more requests per second (custom-built FusionAuth configurations have handled 2,000 requests per second).
* Custom deployments for disaster recovery, compliance, or other reasons.

Please link:/contact[contact us] to learn more about these options.

== SLAs and Availability

We know that availability of your auth system is critical.
Below are some of the steps FusionAuth takes to ensure that FusionAuth Cloud systems are available.

For all deployments:

* All components are monitored via external software systems as well as internal metrics gathering systems.
* The application architecture is not exotic, reducing risk. This is a three tier web application, which is a well understood architecture.
* Third party security researchers can submit security issues via a bug bounty program.
* The FusionAuth software and infrastructure is pentested on a regular basis.
* Major changes, such as FusionAuth upgrades or operating system upgrades, are scripted and rollout timing is controlled by the customer.
* Modifications to the underlying product are tested extensively, including load testing where appropriate.
* Automated rulesets provide protection against DDoS.
* A world class cloud provider's managed services for system components are used where appropriate.
* Network firewalls are automatically configured on deployment to set up "least privileged" access to each architectural component.

For high availability/HA deployments:

* Each deployment has redundant components. This includes, but is not limited to, the DNS system, load balancer, and the compute nodes running FusionAuth.
* Each deployment's relational database is set up in a primary/secondary configuration. If the primary becomes unavailable the secondary will "stand up" and the instance will continue to be available. This is also known as "full database replication".
* Each set of components is run in separate geographic availability zones, geographically separated. This prevents disasters from affecting all components.
* The FusionAuth engineering team will consult on product implementation and can offer "best practices" advice to further ensure system stability.
* We size the instance properly for expected traffic, in consultation with the customer.

You can find more information about service level agreements (SLAs) in the link:/license[FusionAuth license] and link:/license-faq[license FAQ], including uptime numbers and definitions of downtime.

== Deployment IP Addresses

Depending on your security posture, defense in depth requirements, and application architecture, you may need the IP addresses or hostnames of the instances in your FusionAuth Cloud deployment.

There are any number of reasons you might need this information, including:

* Adding the values to the allow list for your SMTP service.
* Punching a hole in a firewall to allow FusionAuth webhooks to be delivered.
* Updating a network access control list to enable access to an on-premises LDAP directory with a connector.
* Any other outbound connection from a FusionAuth deployment.

[WARNING.warning]
====
The IP address, or IP addresses, of a FusionAuth Cloud deployment are not static. They are subject to change. Please plan accordingly by monitoring the IP address to which your service hostname or hostnames resolve.

Hostnames, on the other hand, are immutable. If you can use them instead of IP addresses, that is recommended.
====

Use `nslookup` to find the address, based on your deployment hostname. Start with the default hostname ending in `fusionauth.io`, not any custom domains. 

Deployment nodes follow a naming convention. If your deployment hostname is `piedpiper.fusionauth.io`, the pattern is `piedpiper-N.instance.fusionauth.io` where `N` ranges from `1` to the number of nodes in the deployment. You can find the number of nodes by viewing the deployment in your account portal or by opening a support ticket.

Note that this naming format may change in future versions of FusionAuth Cloud.

Once you know the hostnames, find the IP addresses by using the `nslookup` command like this:

[source,shell]
-----
nslookup piedpiper-1.instance.fusionauth.io
-----

This will output something similar to this:

[source]
-----
Server:		192.168.11.11
Address:	192.168.11.11

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	piedpiper-1.instance.fusionauth.io
Address: 11.11.11.11
-----

Look for the `Address` value in the `answer` section. Above, it is `11.11.11.11`. Repeat this for each node.

[WARNING.warning]
====
IP addresses and hostnames discovered via `nslookup` or other methods should not be used for HTTP requests such as API calls; they won't respond to such requests.

This information should be used only to allow outbound traffic from FusionAuth deployments through firewalls and other network control layers.
====

There is an open issue to https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1393[allow FusionAuth deployments to have static IP addresses].
If this is important to you, please upvote the issue.

In addition to using IP addresses or hostnames as outlined above, consider custom headers, TLS transport and client certificates to ensure that outbound traffic is appropriately secured.

== Load Testing

include::docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/_load-testing-intro.adoc[]

=== General Tips

include::docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/_load-testing-tips.adoc[]

=== Load Testing With FusionAuth Cloud

Load testing is an important part of evaluating FusionAuth. However, it is important to load test in an environment that replicates your expected production environment. This means that if you are planning to use an HA cloud deployment for production, you should load test against that type of environment.

When you are load testing against FusionAuth Cloud instances:

* Please link:https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/[open a support ticket] to let us know when you are planning to load test. We monitor CPU usage and other metrics and it can be helpful for us to know when you are planning to stress test your instance.
* Store configuration as scripts which you can apply to your FusionAuth instance. This allows you to easily stand up and tear down different deployments to see what meets your needs.
* If you have an edition with support, please link:https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/[open a support ticket] if you'd like additional support or guidance on sizing or testing.

Please don't use a FusionAuth Cloud Basic deployment to load test.
Instances on this tier of FusionAuth Cloud run on a single compute node, so the node is running FusionAuth, Elasticsearch and a PostgreSQL database.
The node is therefore very resource constrained, and attempting to run load tests on this type of system is not recommended.
The numbers you get from this type of test will not be valuable to you in planning your production deployment.

Testing on a Business Cloud or High-Availability Cloud plan will provide more useful results.
If you cannot achieve your target request per second with a standard setup, you can create a deployment with larger node sizes.
You can spin up a deployment, apply your configuration, perform load testing, and tear it down.
You'll only be charged for the time the instance is running. 

== Limits

FusionAuth Cloud has the same link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/limitations[limitations] as self hosted FusionAuth. Since it is a managed service, there are additional limitations as well:

* No access is provided to the server on which your deployment is running. This includes access to the database, Elasticsearch, or ssh. You can access your data via FusionAuth API, administrative console, and by occasionally requesting a database export.
* There is no API to manage FusionAuth Cloud deployments.
* You cannot change any of the link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/configuration[FusionAuth configuration options].
* You cannot downgrade the version of a FusionAuth Cloud deployment, from say 1.35 to 1.34.
* You cannot run a link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/kickstart[Kickstart file] on a FusionAuth Cloud deployment.
* There is no support for proxy customization. You can add your own proxy layer, such as CloudFlare, with FusionAuth Cloud as an origin.
* Use of port 25 is not allowed. To connect to an SMTP server such as Mailgun or SES, use a different port.
* The IP addresses of a FusionAuth Cloud deployment are not fixed. Whenever possible, use the domain name, which is fixed. If you need IP addresses of the deployment nodes for purposes such as a network firewall allow list, please open a https://account.fusionauth.io/acccount/support/[support ticket], but be aware that they may change. Please upvote or comment on this https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1393[open issue about static IP addresses in FusionAuth Cloud].
* If you are on FusionAuth Cloud and you find that some requests are failing, it is possible you are being rate limited. This isn't intentional, but an automated part of our infrastructure to ensure FusionAuth Cloud performance and security. If you are rate limited but need these requests to occur, please open a https://account.fusionauth.io/acccount/support/[support ticket] with details.
* If you want to run Advanced Threat Detection, an Enterprise feature, you'll need a cloud deployment with sufficient memory. Currently that means it must be a Large or X-Large size.
* With HA and other multi-node deployments, requests to public metric endpoints such as `/api/status` are routed to individual servers in a non-deterministic fashion and not aggregated across the deployment.
* OpenTelemetry data is not available on FusionAuth Cloud deployments.
