To use FusionAuth download the `docker-compose.yml` and the `.env` files and then start up the configured containers.

[source,shell,title="Download the FusionAuth docker files"]
----
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/docker-compose.yml
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/.env
----

Edit these files as needed. The stock `.env` file will contain the following values, you will want to modify the `DATABASE_PASSWORD` and ensure the `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` values are correct. You may also override any of these values using environment variables.

[source,shell,title=The .env file]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/.env[]
----

[source,shell,title="Starting FusionAuth"]
----
docker-compose up
----

Now you can visit `\http://localhost:9011` and configure FusionAuth.
