== Homebrew Install

Homebrew is a macOS package manager, so if you're running macOS and you're familiar with Homebrew, we've got you covered. Our Homebrew formula is open source and available on GitHub.
https://github.com/FusionAuth/homebrew-fusionauth

To install FusionAuth using brew, first install the Tap, you will only need to do this step once.

```
brew tap fusionauth/homebrew-fusionauth
```

Next, install the FusionAuth services, you can optionally skip the `fusionauth-search` service if you would like to use the database as the User search engine, or if you already have a compatible Elasticsearch service running. See the link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/system-requirements[System Requirements] and link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/configuration[Configuration Reference].

brew install fusionauth-app fusionauth-search
----
:code_id!:

That's it!  Now fire it up!

```
brew services start fusionauth-search
brew services start fusionauth-app
```

Now to get started open your browser to `\http://localhost:9011`, and complete maintenance mode and the setup wizard.

The shared configuration file will be located here: `/usr/local/etc/fusionauth/fusionauth.properties` and the logs are here : `/usr/local/var/log/fusionauth/`.
