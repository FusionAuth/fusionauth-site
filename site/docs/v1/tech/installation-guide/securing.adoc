== Securing

If you're installing FusionAuth on your own server, use the following guide as a baseline for securing the network services. If you need further assistance to secure FusionAuth, please ask a question in the https://fusionauth.io/community/forum/[FusionAuth forum, window="_blank"]. If you have a licensed edition you may open a https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/[support request from your account, window="_blank"].

== Required ports
See the link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/configuration/[Configuration Reference] for more information on default port configuration. The documentation below
assumes the default port configuration.

=== FusionAuth Search

If FusionAuth Search is running on the same system as the FusionAuth App service and you're only running a single instance of FusionAuth
App then no external ports should be allowed for FusionAuth Search. In this scenario, FusionAuth App will access the Elasticsearch
service on port `9021` on the `localhost` address. The default configuration should cause FusionAuth Search to only bind to `127.0.0.1` or other
localhost addresses. See `fusionauth-search.hosts` in the link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/configuration/[Configuration Reference].

If FusionAuth App is installed on multiple servers and those servers can communicate across a private network using a site local address then
the default FusionAuth Search Configuration will not bind to any public IP addresses. In this scenario you will need to allow access to
ports `9020` and `9021` on the site local IP address.

It is not recommended to expose FusionAuth Search to any public network. If this is a requirement, then a firewall should be used to limit traffic to the service based upon the source and destination IP address. 

To protect FusionAuth Search with HTTP basic authentication as well as a firewall, provide the username and password in the URL, like so: `search.servers=http://user:password@myelasticsearchcluster.com`. Support for basic authentication was introduced in version 1.16.

The `9020` port is utilized by Elasticsearch for internal communication including clustering. The `9021` port is the HTTP port utilized by
FusionAuth App to make requests to the search index.

=== FusionAuth App

To access the FusionAuth UI you'll need to open port `9011`. If you have more than one instance of FusionAuth installed you will need
to ensure that each instance of FusionAuth Backend can communicate on port `9011`.
