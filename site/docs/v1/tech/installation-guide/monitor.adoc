title: Monitoring FusionAuth
description: Understand how your installation is operating by monitoring it.

== Overview

Once you've installed and integrated FusionAuth, you have to operate it. And for that you need insight into how the system is performing. There are a number of ways to do so.

== Monitoring Summary Table

Here's an overview table of monitoring options.

.Monitoring Overview
[cols="1,3,2,1"]
|===
| Name | Contains | Ingestion Options | More Information

| System Logs
| Exceptions, stack traces, Database connection issues, Elasticsearch connection issues. Minimal tracing capability unless `debug` logging is enabled.
| Can be exported as a zip file via API.
| link:/docs/v1/tech/troubleshooting/#system-log-ui[More info]

| Audit Logs
| Created by the admin user interface actions. This is just an API, so a customer can also call this API. This is a free form API, and the audit log contents are whatever you put in. 
| This can be consumed via web hook or API.
| link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/audit-logs/[More info]

| Event Logs
| Debug information for external integrations with IdPs, SMTP etc. In general, runtime errors that are typically not caused by FusionAuth and cannot be communicated well at runtime. Examples: a template rendering error in a custom theme, an exception connecting to SMTP due to bad credentials, a failure in a SAML exchange, a connection to web hook is failing.
| This can be consumed via web hook or API.
| link:/docs/v1/tech/troubleshooting/#event-log[More info]

| Login records
| Each successful login is recorded here. Includes IP information, application, user, and data stamp.
| Can be consumed via API. This record itself is not sent through a webhook, but a login success or login failure can be consumed via a web hook.
| link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/login/#export-login-records[More info]

| Webhooks 
| Triggered by events as documented, sending is configurable. Contains IP and location information when available.
| Can be sent to an HTTP endpoint or a Kafka topic.
| link:/docs/v1/tech/events-webhooks/[More info]

| Metrics
| System metrics, such as JVM buffers, memory and threads.
| Can be consumed via API and available in Prometheus compatible format.
| link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/monitor/#metrics[More info]

== Log Files

The system log files will be placed in the `logs` directory under the FusionAuth installation unless you are running FusionAuth in a container. In the latter case, the log output will be sent to STDOUT. 

System logs running in non-containerized instances can also be exported via the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/system/#export-system-logs[Export System Logs API].

link:/docs/v1/tech/troubleshooting/#logs[Learn more about FusionAuth log files].

== Application Logging

There are a few different APIs exposing FusionAuth application specific information you may want to ingest into your monitoring system:

* link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/audit-logs/[FusionAuth administrative user interface audit logs]
* link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/event-logs/[Logs and errors from asynchronous code executation]
* link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/login/#export-login-records[Login records]

In general these are APIs you will have poll to ingest.

== Log File Formats

.Log File Information
[cols="1,3,3,3,1"]
|===
| Log Type | Export Format | Timezone | Date Format | API Docs

| Audit Logs
| Zipped CSV
| Specified by the `zoneId` parameter
| Specified by the `dateTimeSecondsFormat` parameter, defaults to `M/d/yyyy hh:mm:ss a z`
| link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/audit-logs/[API]

| Event Logs
| JSON
| UTC
| link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/data-types/#instants[Instant]
| link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/event-logs/[API]

| Login Records
| Zipped CSV
| Specified by the `zoneId` parameter
| Specified by the `dateTimeSecondsFormat` parameter, defaults to `M/d/yyyy hh:mm:ss a z`
| link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/login/#export-login-records[API]

| System Logs
| Zipped directory of files. Log entries separated by newlines, but may be unstructured (stack traces, etc).
| For log entries, the timezone of the server. The `zoneId` parameter, if provided, is used to build the filename.
| `yyyy-MM-dd h:mm:ss.SSS a`
| link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/system/#export-system-logs[API]

[NOTE]
====
There are currently no plugins for ingesting FusionAuth logs into a log management system. A polling script using a link:/docs/v1/tech/client-libraries/[client library] is usually sufficient. Please https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues[file an issue] if this does not meet your use case.
====

== Application Events

There are a number of events, such as a failed authentication or an account deletion, that you may want to ingest into your monitoring system. These are available as webhooks. 

Here's link:/docs/v1/tech/events-webhooks/events/[the list of all available events].

== Metrics

You can pull system metrics from the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/system/#retrieve-system-status[System API]. The format of these metrics are evolving and thus are not documented.

You can also enable JMX metrics as outlined in the link:/docs/v1/tech/troubleshooting/#enabling-jmx[Troubleshooting documentation].

=== Prometheus Endpoint

The default system metrics are also available in a Prometheus compatible form. link:/docs/v1/tech/tutorials/prometheus[This tutorial explains how to set up Prometheus to scrape the FusionAuth metrics].
