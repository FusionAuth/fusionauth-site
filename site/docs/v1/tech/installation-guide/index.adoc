== Overview

FusionAuth installs nearly anywhere and on anything. Before you start, you should review the link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/system-requirements/[system requirements] for running FusionAuth. You can also review different link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/server-layout/[architecture options]. 

There are four main components to a running FusionAuth instance.

* The link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/fusionauth-app/[FusionAuth app application], which provides core functionality.
* The link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/fusionauth-search/[FusionAuth search application], which provides user search functionality. As of 1.16, this is optional. Learn more.
* The link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/database/[database], which stores the data needed for authentication, authorization and user management.
* A HTTP proxy, which sits in front of FusionAuth and provides an additional layer of access control and flexibility. This is optional.

== Installation Methods
