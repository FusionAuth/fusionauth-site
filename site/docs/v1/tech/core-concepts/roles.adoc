== Overview

Roles in FusionAuth are associated with an link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/applications/[application]. You can define as many roles as you want in an application. There are no limits on the number of roles a user or a group can have.

Roles are application specific and may be specific to the domain of the application. Roles are typically used by APIs and applications to control access to functionality. For example, Zendesk presents a different user interface to users with the `agent` role than to users without that role.

For a further example, an e-commerce application may have the following roles:

* `admin`
* `seller`
* `shopper`

On the other hand, a content management system may have these roles:

* `admin`
* `editor`
* `contributor`
* `subscriber`

Roles are available in the link:/docs/v1/tech/oauth/tokens/[JWT] upon successful link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/authentication-authorization/[authorization] and are also returned as part of the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/registrations/[user's registrations].

You can associate roles with link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/users/[users] directly via their link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/registrations/[registration]. Or you can assign an application role to a link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/groups/[group], and then any users in that group who have access to that application will have that role.

=== Role Attributes

Roles in FusionAuth have the following attributes:

include::docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/_role_attributes.adoc[]

=== FusionAuth Application Roles

FusionAuth provides an administrative user interface for the running instance with several built-in roles. These can be assigned to any user registered with the FusionAuth admin application. These roles control access to functionality within the FusionAuth administrative user interface.

* <<Role Schema and Exceptions>>
* <<Application Roles>>
* <<Special Role - user_support_manager>>

[NOTE]
====
These roles are used only internally to manage authorization within the FusionAuth administrative user interface application.

These roles are *not global* and are not present in any other applications for which FusionAuth provides authentication, authorization, or user management.

Below you can see the administrative user interface screen where you assign roles in the FusionAuth application to a user.

== Role Schema and Exceptions

The below table outlines how roles were designed at an abstract level. Of course, risk is always relative to the information and organization; even a low-access role can do significant damage in the wrong hands.
