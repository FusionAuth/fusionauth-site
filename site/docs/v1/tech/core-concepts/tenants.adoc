== Overview

FusionAuth is fundamentally a single tenant solution, so you may be surprised to learn that we support multiple tenants.

FusionAuth will always be a single tenant solution, this means that your instance of FusionAuth is your own and even when FusionAuth is hosting, we do not co-mingle your data with other clients. FusionAuth was built as a single tenant solution, and we have no plans to change anytime soon.

It is entirely likely that our clients may wish to be multi-tenant or offer their services to more than one client. In these scenarios it may be useful to separate Users, Applications and Groups for each of your clients.

For example, let's assume you are building a payroll offering using a SaaS model. In this case it is possible that `monica@piedpiper.com` works for two of your clients, Acme Corp and The Umbrella Company. Because Monica is not aware that Acme Corp and The Umbrella Company both are buying their Payroll software from the same vendor it would be surprising for Monica to share the same password and account details between these two companies. In this scenario you would likely want to utilize the FusionAuth Tenant to ensure that `monica@piedpiper.com` exists once for each instance of your Payroll offering.

See link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication#making-an-api-request-using-a-tenant-id[Tenant API Authentication] for more details about making API requests in a multi-tenant configuration.

Here's a brief video covering some aspects of tenants:
