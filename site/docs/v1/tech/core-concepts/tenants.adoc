== Overview

FusionAuth is fundamentally a single tenant solution, so you may be surprised to learn that we support multiple tenants.

FusionAuth will always be a single tenant solution, this means that your instance of FusionAuth is your own and even when FusionAuth is hosting, we do not co-mingle your data with other clients. FusionAuth was built as a single tenant solution, and we have no plans to change anytime soon.

It is entirely likely that our clients may wish to be multi-tenant or offer their services to more than one client. In these scenarios it may be useful to separate Users, Applications and Groups for each of your clients.

For example, let's assume you are building a payroll offering using a SaaS model. In this case it is possible that `monica@piedpiper.com` works for two of your clients, Acme Corp and The Umbrella Company. Because Monica is not aware that Acme Corp and The Umbrella Company both are buying their Payroll software from the same vendor it would be surprising for Monica to share the same password and account details between these two companies. In this scenario you would likely want to utilize the FusionAuth Tenant to ensure that `monica@piedpiper.com` exists once for each instance of your Payroll offering.

See link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication#making-an-api-request-using-a-tenant-id[Tenant API Authentication] for more details about making API requests in a multi-tenant configuration.

Here's a brief video covering some aspects of tenants:

[.api]
[field]#Enabled# [optional]#Optional#::
When enabled, WebAuthn is available for the tenant, and additional configuration options will be available.

[field]#Relying party Id# [optional]#Optional#::
The Relying Party Id is used to scope WebAuthn passkeys to the site where they were registered. As part of WebAuthn's security requirements, this value must be either:
+
 * The browser request origin's effective domain
 * A registrable domain suffix of the effective domain
+
For example, if the login page is at `auth.piedpiper.com`, then the following are valid Relying Party Ids:
+
 * `auth.piedpiper.com` - matches the effective domain
 * `piedpiper.com` - a registrable suffix of the effective domain
+
But the following values are _not_ valid:
+
 * `m.auth.piedpiper.com` - a subdomain of the effective domain
 * `com` - this is a suffix of the effective domain but not registrable
+
It is important that this is configured according to the URL that a user would see in their browser while on the FusionAuth login page. See the link:/docs/v1/tech/admin-guide/webauthn[WebAuthn Admin Guide] for more details on how to select the appropriate value.
+
Leaving this value empty will cause the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API[WebAuthn JavaScript API] to use the browser's current request origin.

[field]#Relying party name# [optional]#Optional#::
The Relying Party name for WebAuthn ceremonies. This value may be displayed to the user by the browser or OS during WebAuthn registration and authentication ceremonies.
+
If this value is left blank, the [field]#Issuer# value will be used.

[field]#Debug enabled# [optional]#Optional#::
Enable debug to create an event log to assist you in debugging integration errors.

image::core-concepts/tenant-configuration-webauthn-bootstrap-settings.png[Tenant Configuration - WebAuthn Bootstrap settings,width=1200, role=top-cropped,bottom-cropped]

===== Bootstrap settings

The settings in this section affect the availability and behavior of the WebAuthn bootstrap workflow. The bootstrap workflow is used when the user must "bootstrap" the authentication process by identifying themselves prior to the WebAuthn ceremony and can be used to authenticate from a new device using WebAuthn.

[.api]
[field]#Enabled# [optional]#Optional#::
When enabled, the WebAuthn bootstrap workflow can be used to authenticate users via WebAuthn from new or repeat devices.
+
The availability of the bootstrap workflow can be overridden at the application level on the link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/applications#webauthn[WebAuthn Tab of the Application settings].

[field]#Authenticator attachment# [optional]#Optional#::
The authenticator attachment preference for the bootstrap workflow on this tenant. This value controls the attachment requirement for authenticators during the bootstrap workflow registration ceremony. Authenticators that do not meet the requirement are not considered during passkey registration. The possible values are:
+
 * `Any` - any authenticator attachment is allowed
 * `Platform only` - only authenticators integrated with the client device are allowed
 * `Cross-platform only` - only authenticators that are usable across multiple client devices are allowed
+
The recommended value for the bootstrap workflow is `Any` when the option is available.
+
:enterprise_feature: WebAuthn cross-platform authenticators
include::docs/v1/tech/shared/_enterprise-edition-blurb-api.adoc[]

[field]#User verification# [optional]#Optional#::
The user verification requirement for the bootstrap workflow on this tenant. This value controls whether user verification is required for registration and authentication ceremonies during the bootstrap workflow. Authenticators that do not meet the requirement are not considered during passkey registration or authentication. The possible values are:
+
 * `Required` - user verification is required to complete the WebAuthn ceremony
 * `Preferred` - the Relying Party prefers user verification is provided but will not fail the WebAuthn ceremony without it
 * `Discouraged` - the Relying Party does not want user verification for the WebAuthn ceremony
+
Because the bootstrap workflow is used to authenticate a user, it is _highly_ recommended to set this value to `Required`.

image::core-concepts/tenant-configuration-webauthn-reauthentication-settings.png[Tenant Configuration - WebAuthn Re-authentication settings,width=1200, role=top-cropped,bottom-cropped]

===== Re-authentication settings

The settings in this section affect the availability and behavior of the WebAuthn re-authentication workflow. The re-authentication workflow is meant to provide a streamlined user experience when logging in from a frequently used device.

[.api]
[field]#Enabled# [optional]#Optional#::
When enabled, the WebAuthn re-authentication workflow can be used to streamline the login experience when authenticating from a previously used device.
+
The availability of the re-authentication workflow can be overridden at the application level on the link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/applications#webauthn[WebAuthn Tab of the Application settings].

[field]#Authenticator attachment# [optional]#Optional#::
The authenticator attachment preference for the re-authentication workflow on this tenant. This value controls the attachment requirement for authenticators during the re-authentication workflow registration ceremony. Authenticators that do not meet the requirement are not considered during passkey registration. The possible values are:
+
 * `Any` - any authenticator attachment is allowed
 * `Platform only` - only authenticators integrated with the client device are allowed
 * `Cross-platform only` - only authenticators that are usable across multiple client devices are allowed
+
The recommended value for the re-authentication workflow is `Platform only` to ensure the user has access to that authenticator when logging from the device in the future.
+
:enterprise_feature: WebAuthn cross-platform authenticators
include::docs/v1/tech/shared/_enterprise-edition-blurb-api.adoc[]

[field]#User verification# [optional]#Optional#::
The user verification requirement for the re-authentication workflow on this tenant. This value controls whether user verification is required for registration and authentication ceremonies during the re-authentication workflow. Authenticators that do not meet the requirement are not considered during passkey registration or authentication. The possible values are:
+
 * `Required` - user verification is required to complete the WebAuthn ceremony
 * `Preferred` - the Relying Party prefers user verification is provided but will not fail the WebAuthn ceremony without it
 * `Discouraged` - the Relying Party does not want user verification for the WebAuthn ceremony
+
Because the re-authentication workflow is used to authenticate a user, it is _highly_ recommended to set this value to `Required`.

===== Rate limit settings

include::docs/v1/tech/shared/_enterprise-edition-blurb.adoc[]

The Rate limit settings allow you to set a number of times an action can be attempted within a specific time frame. When the limit is exceeded, that action is unavailable until the configured time frame elapses without a failed attempt. The settings are evaluated and enforced per user.

[.api]
[field]#Action#::
The action to be rate limited.

[field]#Enabled#::
When enabled, the corresponding action will be rate limited when the [field]#limit# value has been exceeded within the specified [field]#time period#.
