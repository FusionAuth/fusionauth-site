== Overview

FusionAuth is all about users, and it is helpful to fully understand how FusionAuth understands users to fully leverage all of the features FusionAuth offers.

The User itself is easy enough to understand, it represents your end user, your employee or your client. In order to help you manage users and what resources they are authorized to access we have built a few other entities.

These are Applications, Roles, Groups, Registrations and Tenants. A Tenant is a top level object that contains Users, Applications and Groups. Applications have Roles. Groups contain Users and may have associated Roles. Users have Registrations with Applications. Users authenticate and are authorized to access Applications.

You may or may not have a use for Groups or Tenants at present, but it will be helpful to know how they work in case you have a future need. You'll want to have an understanding of the integration points available in FusionAuth.

Finally, FusionAuth is under active development and the roadmap guidance is helpful for knowing where the application is headed.
