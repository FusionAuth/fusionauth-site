== Overview

A FusionAuth Application is simply something a user can log into. When you use the Login API, you will provide an `applicationId` to indicate what resource you're attempting to obtain authorization.

When you use one of the OAuth2 / OpenID Connect authorization grants you will provide a `client_id` in some fashion. This client identifier will be unique to a single FusionAuth application which allows FusionAuth to verify the User is registered for the requested Application and subsequently return the correct roles.

The `applicationId` and `client_id` can be considered synonymous, both concepts leverage the same "Id" value.

Here's a brief video covering some aspects of applications:

=== Add an Application

Before you start your integration with FusionAuth you need to set up at least one Application. Click on [breadcrumb]#Applications# from the left navigation to begin.

image::core-concepts/create-application.png[Create an Application,width=1200]

==== Form Fields

[.api]
[field]#Id# [optional]#Optional#::
An optional UUID. When this value is omitted a unique Id will be generated automatically. This will also be used as the [field]#Client Id# in the [breadcrumb]#OAuth# configuration, so if you require a specific value for that, set it here.

[field]#Name# [required]#Required#::
The name of the Application. This value is for display purposes only and can be changed at any time.

[field]#Tenant# [required]#Required#::
The tenant in which to create this Application.
+
This field is only displayed once multiple tenants exist in FusionAuth. When only a single tenant exists, the Application will always be created in the default tenant.

=== Roles

The Roles tab will only be available on the Add Application form. To manage roles after the Application has been created you will use the Manage Roles action.

==== Table columns

include::docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/_role_attributes.adoc[]

To manage Application Roles after you have added an Application, click the icon:user[role=ui-button purple,type=fas] Manage Roles button on the index page. To edit an Application click the icon:edit[role=ui-button blue,type=fas] edit icon. The following sections will walk you through each panel for the edit action.

image::applications.png[Applications,width=1200,role=shadowed bottom-cropped]

=== OAuth

The OAuth tab allows you to configure the OAuth2 and OpenID Connect settings specific to this Application.

image::core-concepts/application-oauth.png[Application OAuth configuration,width=1200,role=top-cropped]


==== Form Fields

[.api]
[field]#Client Id# [read-only]#Read-only#::
The read only client Id for this Application. The client Id is used by OAuth2 / OpenID Connect to authenticate the grant request.

[field]#Client secret# [read-only]#Read-only#::
The read only client secret used for client authentication. When you enable Require authentication, this client secret will be required to obtain an access token from the Token endpoint.
+
You may optionally regenerate the client secret if you think it has been compromised.

[field]#Require authentication# [optional]#Optional#::
When enabled access to the Token endpoint will require the use of the `client_secret` parameter. In most cases you will not want to disable this setting.
+
There may be scenarios where you have a requirement to make a request to the Token endpoint where you cannot safely secure a client secret. In these scenarios you may need to disable client authentication. This includes native mobile applications and single page applications (SPAs) running in a browser. In these scenarios it is recommended you use PKCE.

[field]#Generate refresh tokens# [optional]#Optional#::
When enabled, FusionAuth will return a refresh token when the `offline_access` scope has been requested. When this setting is disabled refresh tokens will not be generated even if the `offline_access` scope is requested.

[field]#Debug enabled# [optional]#Optional#::
Enable debug to create an event log to assist you in debugging integration errors.

[field]#Authorized redirect URLs# [optional]#Optional#::
When OAuth grants, such as the authorization code grant, require a browser redirect to a URL found in the `redirect_uri` parameter, the destination URLs must be added to this list. URLs that are not authorized may not be utilized in the `redirect_uri` parameter or the `post_logout_redirect_uri` parameter.
+
You can add as many URLs as you'd like to this list. Only exact string matches with the provided `redirect_uri` will be allowed. No partial or wildcard matches will be accepted.

[field]#Authorized request origin URLs# [optional]#Optional#::
This optional configuration allows you to restrict the origin of an OAuth2 / OpenID Connect grant request. If no origins are registered for this Application, all origins are allowed.
+
By default FusionAuth will add the `X-Frame-Options: DENY` HTTP response header to the login pages to keep these pages from being rendered in an iframe. If the request comes from an authorized origin, however, FusionAuth will not add this header to the response. To load FusionAuth hosted login pages in an iframe, you will need to add the request origin to this configuration.

[field]#Logout URL# [optional]#Optional#::
The optional logout URL for this Application. When provided this logout URL should handle the logout of a user in your application.
+
If you need to end an HTTP session, or delete cookies to logout a user from your application, these operations should be handled by this URL. When the `/oauth2/logout` endpoint is utilized, each Logout URL registered for Applications in this tenant will be called within an iframe to complete the SSO logout.
+
If the OAuth2 logout endpoint is used with this Client Id, this configured Logout URL will be also utilized as the redirect URL. This behavior only occurs when the `post_logout_redirect_uri` parameter is not provided.
+
If this Application has not defined a Logout URL, the value configured at the Tenant level will be used. If no Logout URL has been configured, a redirect to `/` will occur. A specific redirect URL may also be provided by using the `post_logout_redirect_uri` request parameter.
+
See the link:/docs/v1/tech/oauth/endpoints/#logout[Logout endpoint] for more information.

[field]#Logout behavior# [optional]#Optional#::
This selector allows you to modify the behavior when using the link:/docs/v1/tech/oauth/endpoints/#logout[Logout endpoint] with this Client Id.
+
    * All applications - This is the default behavior. Logout out of the FusionAuth SSO, call each registered Logout URLs for the entire tenant and then redirect to the Logout URL registered for this application.
    * Redirect only - Do not call each registered Logout URL in the tenant, instead logout out of the FusionAuth SSO and then only redirect to the Logout URL registered for this application.
+
See the link:/docs/v1/tech/oauth/endpoints/#logout[Logout endpoint] for more information.

[field]#Enabled grants# [optional]#Optional#::
The enabled OAuth2 grants. If a grant is not enabled and a client requests this grant during authentication an error will be returned to the caller indicating the grant is not enabled.
+
    * Authorization Code
    * Device
    * Implicit
    * Password
    * Refresh Token
+
See The link:/docs/v1/tech/oauth/[OAuth 2.0 & OpenID Connect Overview] for additional information on each of these grants.

When you enable the `Device` grant you will be shown one additional configuration field:

image::core-concepts/application-oauth-device-url.png[Application OAuth configuration Device URL,width=1200,role=top-cropped]

==== Form Fields

[.api]
[field]#Device verification URL# [required]#Required#::
The URL to be returned during the Device Authorization request to be displayed to the end user. This URL will be where the end user navigates in order to complete the device authentication workflow.
+
Required when the `Device` grant has been enabled.

=== CleanSpeak

The CleanSpeak configuration panel allows you to optionally configure username filtering through the use of a CleanSpeak integration. See link:/docs/v1/tech/integrations/cleanspeak/[CleanSpeak Integration] for additional configuration details.

The use of this feature requires a licensed instance of CleanSpeak. See https://cleanspeak.com for additional information.

image::core-concepts/application-cleanspeak.png[No Application Webhooks,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped top-cropped]

=== Email

The email configuration allows you to optionally select customized email templates for this Application. When configured, an application specific template will be used instead of the tenant configured email template.

image::core-concepts/application-email.png[Application Email,width=1200]

==== Form Fields

[.api]
[field]#Email verification# [optional]#Optional# [since]#Available since 1.19.0#::
When a template is selected this will be used instead of the template configured by the tenant. This template can only be used when a user is created and registered at the same time. If a user is created without a User Registration the tenant configured template will be used because there is no application context available.

[field]#Forgot password# [optional]#Optional# [since]#Available since 1.19.0#::
When a template is selected this will be used instead of the template configured by the tenant if an application context is available.

[field]#Passwordless login# [optional]#Optional# [since]#Available since 1.19.0#::
When a template is selected this will be used instead of the template configured by the tenant.

[field]#Setup password# [optional]#Optional# [since]#Available since 1.19.0#::
When a template is selected this will be used instead of the template configured by the tenant. This template can only be used when a user is created and registered at the same time. If a user is created without a User Registration the tenant configured template will be used because there is no application context available.

=== JWT

The JWT configuration allows you to provide application specific JWT configuration. When this panel is left in the default state as in shown in this screenshot without the enable toggle turned on, the JWT configuration provided by the Tenant will be utilized.

image::core-concepts/application-jwt-disabled.png[Application JWT disabled,width=1200]

[.api]
[field]#Enabled# [optional]#Optional#::
When enabled you may configure Application specific JWT configuration including signing keys, durations, etc.

==== Lambda Settings

The application specific lambda settings are available even if you choose not to enable additional application specific JWT configuration by leaving the [field]#Enable# field off.

[.api]
[field]#Access token populate lambda# [optional]#Optional#::
The lambda to be invoked during the generation of an Access Token (JWT) when a user authenticates against this Application.

[field]#Id token populate lambda# [optional]#Optional#::
The lambda to be invoked during the generation of an Id Token (JWT) when a user authenticates against this Application.

Once you have enabled JWT configuration for this Application you will be provided with additional configuration options.

image::core-concepts/application-jwt-enabled-configuration.png[Application JWT enabled,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped top-cropped]

==== JWT Settings

[.api]
[field]#Issuer# [read-only]#Read-only#::
The issuer used in the `iss` claim when building the Access Token and Id Token. This is a read-only value in this configuration. It can be modified in the Tenant configuration.

[field]#JWT duration# [required]#Required#::
The duration in seconds for which a JWT will be valid after creation. After this time has passed the JWT will expire and can no longer be used.

[field]#Access token signing key# [optional]#Optional#::
The signing key used to sign the Access Token (which is a JWT) when a user authenticates against this Application. When this value is not selected, FusionAuth will generate a new key pair and assign it to this configuration.

[field]#Id token signing key# [optional]#Optional#::
The signing key used to sign the Id Token (which is a JWT) when a user authenticates against this Application. When this value is not selected, FusionAuth to generate a new key pair and assign it to this configuration.

image::core-concepts/application-jwt-enabled-refresh-token.png[Application Refresh Token configuration,width=1200,role=shadowed top-cropped]

==== Refresh Token Settings

[.api]
[field]#Refresh token duration# [required]#Required#::
The duration in minutes the refresh token will be valid after creation. After this time has passed the refresh token will no longer be able to be used to receive a new Access Token (JWT).

[field]#Refresh token expiration# [optional]#Optional#::
The [field]#Refresh token expiration# may be either a fixed or sliding window. By default the expiration of a refresh token is a fixed length of time from when it was originally issued. With a sliding window expiration, the expiration is calculated from the last time the refresh token was used.
+
For instance, if a refresh token is issued at 1:00pm and has a duration of 60 minutes, if the expiration is fixed, the token will expire at 2:00pm. If, instead, the expiration is a sliding window, then if the refresh token is used at 1:55pm, it would then expire at 2:55pm. If it were then used at 2:50pm, it would expire at 3:50 pm.

[field]#Refresh token usage# [optional]#Optional#::
The [field]#Refresh token usage# may be reusable or one time use. By default, a token is reusable and the token does not change after it was issued. With a one time use token, the token value will be changed each time the token is used to refresh a JWT. This means the client must store the new value after each use.

=== Multi-Factor

The multi-factor configuration allows you to provide Application specific multi-factor settings.  

image::core-concepts/application-mfa.png[Multi-Factor Authentication configuration,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped top-cropped]

When enabled, allow users to optionally authenticate using an Application specific token in place of their password. This should only be used when the security requirements are low and the user's normal password is not a good option for authentication. 
+
For example, if a password needs to be stored in an external configuration and the exposure risk is low, a token can be used in place of the user's password. This token may only be used for authorization for this application.


=== Webhooks

The Webhooks tab allows you to select one or more webhooks to be used for this Application. In this example screenshot either no webhooks have been configured, or no application specific webhooks are configured.

image::core-concepts/application-webhooks-none.png[No Application Webhooks,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

In most cases you will not need to configure this panel. Only a few specific events are considered application specific, and when a webhook is configured to be application specific, only those events will be sent to the webhook.

[WARNING.warning]
====
In a future release this configuration tab will be removed.
====

This example screenshot shows one Application specific webhook selected. This option will be visible if at least one webhook is configured as application specific.
