== Overview

There are many use cases where it is helpful to model entities in addition to users. Examples might include devices, cars, computers, customers, companies, etc. +

[%hardbreaks]

_Enter Entities._ Entities allow you to model everything right from FusionAuth!

=== Features

==== Scalability
- FusionAuth Entity Management supports large volumes of Entities right out of the box.
- This is especially helpful for Internet of Things (IOT) devices; FusionAuth scales right alongside them.

==== Typecasting
- Entities can have types.
- For example, `locks`, `cars`, `companies`, `corporate divisions`, `computers`, `APIs`
- Entity Types can help define permissions.
- You are limited only by your business need and imagination!

==== Permissions aware
- Permissions can be assigned to each Entity Type.
- Entities can share permissions with other Entities (In OAuth parlance, this synonymous with the client credentials grant).
- Users can have permissions to Entities.

=== Common Applications
- Corporate relationship modeling
- Per use device permissions
- Internet IoT

====  Can't I just use a group?

In some cases, Groups work as a model for such ideas as `customers`. However, the flexibility of Groups is limited by their lack of typecasting (very much needed as use cases evolve). Additionally, Groups do not have a hierarchical model or permissions functionality built in.
