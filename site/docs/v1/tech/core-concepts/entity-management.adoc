== Overview

There are many use cases where it is helpful to model entities in addition to users. Examples might include devices, cars, computers, customers, companies, etc. +

[%hardbreaks]
_Enter Entities._ Entities allow you to model everything right from FusionAuth!

== Features

=== Scalability

- FusionAuth Entity Management supports large volumes of Entities right out of the box.
- This is especially helpful for Internet of Things (IoT) devices; FusionAuth scales right alongside them.

=== Typecasting

- Entities can have a type.
- For example, an Entity could be a type of  `lock`, `car`, `company`, `corporate division`, `computer`, or `API`
- Entity Types can define permissions.
- You are limited only by your business need and imagination!

=== Permissions Aware

- Permissions can be assigned to each Entity Type.
- Entities can be granted permissions on other entities (In OAuth terms, entities can initiate a Client Credentials Grant to obtain access to other entities).
- Users can have permissions to access Entities.

== Common Applications

- Corporate relationship modeling
- Per use device permissions
- Internet IoT

Below is an example diagram using the client credentials grant, and an email Entity Type.

=== Can't I Just Use a Group?

In some cases, Groups work as a model for such ideas like `customers`. However, the flexibility of Groups is limited by their lack of typecasting (very much needed as use cases evolve). Additionally, Groups do not have a hierarchical model or permissions functionality built in.

== Entity Types

This is the Entity Types homepage. Here you can: +

[width="50%",cols="0, 3"]

| icon:plus[role=ui-button green,type=fas] | *Create* a new Entity Type
| icon:edit[role=ui-button blue,type=fas] | *Edit* a previously created Entity Type
| icon:key[role=ui-button purple,type=fa] | *Manage Permissions* on Entity Type
| icon:search[role=ui-button green,type=fas] | *View* the previously created Entity Type
| icon:trash[role=ui-button,type=fas] | *Remove* the previously created Entity Type
//| image:trash.png[Trash,width=25 marginleft=0] | *Remove* the previously created Entity Type

== Add Entity Type Form Fields

image::entity-type-add.png[Create an Entity Type,width=1200]

Creating a new Entity Type is straightforward.

Just complete the following fields:

[.api]
[field]#Id# [optional]#Optional#::
An optional UUID. When this value is omitted, a unique Id will be generated automatically.

[field]#JSON Web Token Settings# [optional]#Optional#::
If you need custom JWT signing algorithms. If unchecked, any tokens generated for this entity will use the Entity's tenant jwt signing settings.

[field]#Name# [required]#Required#::
The name of the Entity Type. This value is for display purposes only and can be changed at any time.

== Manage Permissions Form Fields

Here you can add/manage custom permissions. +
Below is an example if no permissions are set previously; the UI is similar if simply updating existing permissions.

[.api]
[field]#Name# [required]#Required#::
The name of the permission

[field]#Default# [optional]#Optional#::
If this permission should be assigned once the Entity Type is created (by default). More than one default can be set.

[field]#Description# [optional]#Optional#::
Please write a helpful description of the permissions' purpose.

== Limitations

It is not currently possible to utilize an OAuth2 grant to retrieve user permissions to an entity.  Please review link:https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1295/[GitHub Issue #1295] and vote if you would like to see this capability in FusionAuth.
