== Overview

There are many use cases where we need to model entities in addition to users. Examples might include devices, cars, computers, customers, companies, etc. +

[%hardbreaks]

_Enter Entities._  Entities allow you to model everything right from FusionAuth!

=== Features

==== Scalability
- Support for large volumes of entities.
- This is especially helpful for Internet of Things (IOT) devices. FusionAuth scales right alongside them.

==== Typecasting
- Entities can have types.
- For example, `locks`, `cars`, `companies`, `corporate divisions`, `computers`, `APIs`
- Types can help define permissions
- You are limited only by your business need and imagination!

==== Permissions aware
- Permissions can be assigned to each entity type.
- Entities can share permissions with other entities (In OAuth parlance, this synonymous with the client credentials grant).
- Users can have permissions to entities.

=== Common Applications
- Internet IoT
- Corporate relationship modeling
- Per use device permissions

====  Can't I just use a group?

In some cases, Groups work as a model for things like customers. However, Groups might need to be used for other purposes and cannot be easily typed. Groups also don't form a hierarchy and don't have a permission model.
