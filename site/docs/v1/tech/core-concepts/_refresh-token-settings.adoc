[field]#Refresh token duration# [required]#Required# [default]#Defaults to `43,200`#::
The length of time the refresh token is valid. Refresh tokens are typically long lived.

[field]#Refresh token expiration# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `Fixed`#::
The [field]#Refresh token expiration# may be either a fixed or sliding window. By default the expiration of a refresh token is a fixed length of time from when it was originally issued. With a sliding window expiration, the expiration is calculated from the last time the refresh token was used.
+
For instance, if a refresh token is issued at 1:00pm and has a duration of 60 minutes, if the expiration is fixed, the token will expire at 2:00pm. If, instead, the expiration is a sliding window, then if the refresh token is used at 1:55pm, it would then expire at 2:55pm. If it were then used at 2:50pm, it would expire at 3:50 pm.

[field]#Refresh token usage# [optional]#Optional# [default]#Defaults to `Reusable`#::
The [field]#Refresh token usage# may be reusable or one time use. By default, a token is reusable and the token does not change after it was issued. With a one time use token, the token value will be changed each time the token is used to refresh a JWT. This means the client must store the new value after each use.
