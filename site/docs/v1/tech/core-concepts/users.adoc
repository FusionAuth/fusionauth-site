== Overview

FusionAuth is all about users, and it is helpful to fully understand how FusionAuth understands users to fully leverage all of the features FusionAuth offers.

The User itself is easy enough to understand, it represents your end user, your employee or your client.

* <<What Makes a User Active>>
* <<User Search>>
* <<User Localization>>

Here's a brief video covering some aspects of users:

== User Scope

A User is scoped to a Tenant.  A User existing within a Tenant can be registered to, and use the same credentials to authenticate to multiple applications within that Tenant.

== What Makes a User Active

FusionAuth includes reporting on the number of daily and monthly active users. What makes a User active during a time period is any of these events:

* A User is created.
* A User logs in. 
* The link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/login/#update-login-instant[Login Ping API] is used.
* A JWT is refreshed using a Refresh Token.
* SSO is used; this calls the login ping.

There are many different ways to log in using FusionAuth, but all of the below trigger a login event:

include::docs/v1/tech/shared/_login_events.adoc[]


== User Search

User search requests may be made through the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/users#search-for-users[User Search API] or within the FusionAuth admin UI under [breadcrumb]#Users#.

As of version 1.16.0, FusionAuth ships with a database search engine as the default.

=== Configuration

See the [field]#fusionauth-app.search-engine-type# and [field]#fusionauth-app.search-servers# properties, as well as the `FUSIONAUTH_SEARCH_ENGINE_TYPE` and `FUSIONAUTH_SEARCH_SERVERS` environment variables definitions of the link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/configuration/[Configuration Reference] for details on configuring the search engine and (optional) Elasticsearch integration.

If you are running FusionAuth in a Docker environment, see the link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/docker/[Using FusionAuth on Docker] documentation for an example configuring Elasticsearch as the user search engine.

You may view the configured search engine type in the FusionAuth admin UI by navigating to [breadcrumb]#System -> About#.

You may also link:/docs/v1/tech/tutorials/switch-search-engines/[switch between the different search engines].

=== Database Search Engine

This configuration is lightweight, simplifies installation and system complexity, but comes with the trade offs of limited search capabilities and performance implications.

The database search engine is appropriate for systems that are not dependent on the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/users#search-for-users[User Search APIs], is not expected to have a large number of active users, and may be running in an embedded environment. 

The database search engine enables fuzzy search against the following fields of the user:

* `firstName`
* `lastName`
* `fullName`
* `email`
* `username`

image::user-search-database.png[User Search with Database Search Engine,width=1200,role=shadowed bottom-cropped]

If you don't need advanced searching capabilities, you may be able to use the database search engine for large installations. This is not a use case FusionAuth tests, so ensure you provision your database with enough resources and benchmark your typical use cases.

==== Limitations

You may add a `*` character to wildcard match any character, including none. So `*piedpiper` will match `piedpiper` and `thepiedpiper`. You may put the wildcard at any location in a search string.

All search terms are converted to lowercase and compared with lowercase values.

Regular expressions, ranges and other complicated queries can not be used.

=== Elasticsearch Search Engine

Leveraging Elasticsearch for the user search engine, enables advanced search capabilities on more numerous and granular data and a performance improvement for user search.

The Elasticsearch search engine is appropriate for systems that are dependent on the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/users#search-for-users[User Search APIs], are expected to have a large number of active users, and requires a more tactical search than is provided by the database search engine.

==== Advanced Search UI

FusionAuth provides an advanced user search interface that reveals how you may construct [field]#queryString# and [field]#query# parameters for the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/users#search-for-users[User Search API] and link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/users#bulk-delete-users[User Bulk Delete API] with desired results. Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Users# from the left navigation and click on the "Advanced" link below the Search input field to begin.  The "Advanced" portion of this UI is available when the search engine type is configured to `elasticsearch`.

We provide selectors for common search fields, as well as a free-form search field for constructing complex search queries.  By selecting the [field]#Show Elasticsearch query# toggle, you will see either the Elasticsearch query string or JSON search query that can be used as [field]#queryString# and [field]#query# parameters for the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/users#search-for-users[User Search API] and link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/users#bulk-delete-users[User Bulk Delete API].

Additionally, you may enter Elasticsearch query strings or raw JSON queries into the search field for testing purposes.

The following screenshot shows a query string being constructed to search for users that belong to the `Moderators` group and are in the `Default` tenant:

image::user-search-query-string.png[User Search by Query String,width=1200,role=shadowed top-cropped]

When searching for users by application or any fields on an application, it is necessary to construct a JSON query due to the way the Elasticsearch mapping is defined.

The following screenshot shows an Elasticsearch JSON query being constructed to search for users that match the email pattern `*@fusionauth.io`, are registered to the `Pied Piper` application, and are assigned the `admin` role:

image::user-search-json-query.png[User Search by JSON Query,width=1200,role=shadowed top-cropped]

==== Reindex

It is possible, though rare, for an Elasticsearch index to become out of sync with the database. If you stand up FusionAuth with a database dump and restore, you may need to run this operation. You may also be instructed to do so by FusionAuth support. 

However, in general, even if a temporary outage occurs with Elasticsearch, the index will be sync up automatically. Reindexing is an expensive operation, especially if your system has a large number of users, so it should not be run unless necessary.

If you do need to run this, navigate to [breadcrumb]#System -> Reindex# in the FusionAuth admin UI to initiate a reindex of all users. This navigation item will only be displayed when the search engine is Elasticsearch.

== User Localization

FusionAuth is built from the ground up with localization in mind. You can assign a user's `preferredLanguages` via the API or link:/docs/v1/tech/guides/advanced-registration-forms/[advanced registration form]. Then you can add the language value to a JWT or retrieve it from via the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/users[User API]. Each application registration can also have an associated preferred language associated, if different applications have different supported languages.

Both the hosted login pages and the emails can be localized; the former via link:/docs/v1/tech/themes/localization/[themes] and the latter via link:/docs/v1/tech/email-templates/email-templates/[email templates]. 

=== Translations of the Hosted Login Pages

The hosted login pages have been translated into a number of languages available for installation. View and contribute to the hosted login pages localizations in the https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-localization/[fusionauth-localization GitHub repo]. The current list of languages is:

* English (en)
* Danish (da)
* German (de)
* Spanish (es)
* Finnish (fi)
* French (fr)
* Indonesian (id_ID)
* Italian (it)
* Dutch (nl)
* Polish (pl)
* Portuguese - Brazilian (pt_BR)
* Russian (ru)
* Swedish (sv)
* Ukrainian (ua)

=== Localization of the Admin UI

If you set the user's preferred language, FusionAuth's administrative user interface will localized. Items such as dates and numbers will be formatted based on the user's locale. FusionAuth supports the following locales for the administrative user interface.

* Arabic (ar)
* Czech (cs)
* Danish (da)
* German (de)
* Greek (el)
* English (en)
* English - US (en_us)
* Spanish (es)
* French (fr)
* Irish (ga)
* Hebrew (he)
* Hindi (hi)
* Italian (it)
* Japanese (ja)
* Korean (ko)
* Dutch (nl)
* Norwegian (no)
* Portuguese (pt)
* Russian (ru)
* Swedish (sv)
* Chinese (zh)
* Chinese - Simplified (zh_CN)
* Chinese - Traditional (zh_TW)

[NOTE]
====
The above list is of localizations of the administrative user interface for date, time and numbers, not translations of the entire user interface.
====

For instance, in the below screenshot, Richard's account has a `preferredLanguage` of `French`. When Richard interacts with the FusionAuth administrative user interface,  the account with the email dinesh@fusionauth.io, which was created on Oct 5, 2020, has a creation date display formatted as specified by the French locale, with the day first.

There are no translations of the FusionAuth administrative user interface, however. Currently the only supported language is English. If you'd like to see additional localizations or translations of this interface, please https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-issues/issues[file an issue].
