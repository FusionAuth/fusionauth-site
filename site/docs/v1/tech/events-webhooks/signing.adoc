== Signing Webhooks

Signing Webhook events allows you to verify each event was sent by FusionAuth. Webhook signatures provide an extra layer of security in addition to the methods described in link:/docs/v1/tech/events-webhooks/securing[Securing a Webhook]. Signature verification provides protection against bad actors spoofing webhook event payloads to look like they came from FusionAuth.

This document covers configuring webhook signatures, verifying signatures in your webhook listener, and key rotation.

=== Configuration

Configuring webhook signatures in FusionAuth consists of generating a key and configuring your webhook to sign using that key.

Keys are generated or imported from [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Key Master#. Webhooks can be signed with three types of keys

* EC key - strongest cryptography, public key can be available
* RSA key - strong cryptography, public key can be available
* HMAC key - fast cryptography, requires manual key distribution

EC and RSA keys allow you to make public keys available through the `/.well-known/jwks.json` endpoint, which facilitates key rotation. If your webhook listener cannot make outbound network connections or you prefer to manually configure your key in your webhook listener, HMAC keys are a good option.

For this example, we'll use an RSA key pair. More information on keys is available in the link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/key-master[Key Master Guide].

Next, you configure your webhook to sign the event with this key. From [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Webhooks#, click on the Edit button for your webhook (or create a new webhook). Select the [breadcrumb]#Security# tab panel. Once you enable [field]#Sign events#, a [field]#Signing key# select dropdown allows you to choose the generated key. Be sure to click Save in the upper right corner.

=== Signature Verification

The webhook signature is provided in the HTTP header `X-FusionAuth-Signature-JWT` as a signed JWT with a claim of `request_body_sha256` containing the SHA-256 hash of the webhook event payload.

Your webhook listener can verify the signature by:

- Verifying the JWT is properly signed
- Decoding the JWT
- Comparing the JWT's `request_body_sha256` claim against your own calculated SHA-256 hash of the event body

The JWT decodes with:
[source,json]
.JWT header
----
{
   "alg": "RS256",
   "typ": "JWT",
   "kid": "_H07wVG1fV3l5ih74rNxIC3nevE"
 }
----

.JWT payload
----
{
  "request_body_sha256": "KeV+/HGoIQrxuE5YPCRR6AuQOJveldYNNhbVi1i22qk="
}
----

The `kid` identifies the Id of the key used to sign the JWT. JWT libraries can look the key up from the JWKS endpoint, or a locally stored key can be used. After verifying the JWT signature, the JWT's `request_body_sha256` payload claim is compared against your own calculated SHA-256 hash of the event body

=== Example Webhook Listener Code

The following code (https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-javascript-webhooks/blob/main/signature-verify/app.js[available on Github]) demonstrates webhook signature verification with a simple Node server.

=== Testing

The
link:/docs/v1/tech/events-webhooks/#test-a-webhook[Webhook Testing] page provides a quick way to test your webhook signature configuration and signature verification on your webhook listener.

=== Key Rotation

link:/docs/v1/tech/tutorials/key-rotation[Rotating keys] regularly is an important part of a defense-in-depth strategy. The type of key used for signing webhook events and the method used for fetching that key determines the process for rotating keys.

* Signatures validated using a public key (RSA or EC) where signature verification dynamically fetches public key from `.well-known/jwks.json` endpoint
** Generate new key in FusionAuth
** Update webhook signing key to use new key
** Test
** Delete old key
* Other cases
** Generate new key
** Update your webhook listener to accept new key in addition to old key
** Update webhook to use new key
** Test
** Update your webhook listener to only accept new key
** Delete old key from FusionAuth
