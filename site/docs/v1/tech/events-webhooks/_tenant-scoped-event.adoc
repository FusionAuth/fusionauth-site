Prior to version 1.37.0 this was a tenant scoped event. This event will be sent to all tenants that are listening, but will contain a [field]#tenantId# to allow for filtering.

In version 1.37.0 and later this is also a tenant scoped event. It can be sent to all tenants or to one or more specified tenants. However, those tenants will not be sent events for other tenants, but only events related to themselves.
