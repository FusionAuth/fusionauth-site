    [field]#No Webhooks are required to succeed#::

    [field]#Any single Webhook must succeed#::
    The event will succeed as long as one or more of the webhooks respond with a status code between `200` and `299` (inclusive).
    [field]#A simple majority of Webhooks must succeed#::
    The event will succeed if at least half of the webhooks respond with a status code between `200` and `299` (inclusive). This means 50% or more of the webhooks must respond successfully.
    [field]#A two-thirds majority of Webhooks must succeed#::
    The event will succeed if a super majority of the webhooks respond with a status code between `200` and `299` (inclusive). A super majority is two-thirds (66.7%) or more of the configured webhooks.
    [field]#All of the Webhooks must succeed#::
    The event will succeed if every configured webhook responds with a status code between `200` and `299` (inclusive). Use this setting when it is critical for every configured webhook to receive and process the event before considering it complete.
