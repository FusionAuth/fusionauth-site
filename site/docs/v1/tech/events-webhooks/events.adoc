* <<User Update>> - when a user is updated
* <<User Deactivate>> - when a user is deactivated
* <<User Reactivate>> - when a user is reactivated
* <<User Delete>> - when a user is deleted
* <<User Email Verified>> - when a user verifies their email address
* <<User Login Success>> - when a user successfully completes login
* <<User Login Failure>> - when a user fails to complete login
* <<User Password Breach>> - when Reactor detects a user is using a potentially breached password
* <<User Registration Create>> - when a new user registration is created
* <<User Registration Update>> - when a user registration is update
* <<User Registration Delete>> - when a user registration is deleted
* <<User Registration Verified>> - when a user completes registration verification
* <<JWT Public Key Update>> - when a JWT RSA Public / Private keypair used for signing may have been updated.
* <<JWT Refresh Token Revoke>> - when a refresh token (or multiple tokens) are revoked


== User Actions

This event is generated when a User Action is taken on a user and when temporal actions transition between phases.

A temporal action is one that has a start time and and a duration, when a phase transition occurs an event will be sent to the webhook. See the [field]#event.phase# in the message body.

* All Refresh Tokens owned by a single User are revoked
* All Refresh Tokens for an Application are revoked

|[field]#event.applicationTimeToLiveInSeconds# [type]#[Map<UUID, Integer>]#
|A map of Application Id to the configured time to live (TTL) for the access token (JWT). This can be used to identify the maximum amount of time after this event occurred where an un-expired access token may be held by a user.

If you take the [field]#createInstant# of this event and add the number of seconds for a specific application TTL you come up with an instant in time where you should consider all access tokens issued before this time invalid. This is because the access token will have been issued on or before the instant the refresh token was revoked.

This map will contain a single entry for the application represented by the [field]#applicationId# field.

|[field]#event.createInstant# [type]#[Long]#
|The link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/data-types#instants[instant] that the event was generated.

|[field]#event.id# [type]#[UUID]#
|The event unique Id. You may receive an event more than once based upon your transaction settings. This Id may be used to identify a duplicate event.

|[field]#event.tenantId# [type]#[UUID]# [since]#Available Since 1.8.0#
|The unique tenant identifier. This value may not be returned if not applicable.

|[field]#event.type# [type]#[String]#
|The event type, this value will always be `jwt.refresh-token.revoke`.

|[field]#event.userId# [type]#[UUID]#
|The unique Id of the User for which a refresh token has been revoked.

|[field]#event.user# [type]#[Object]# [since]#Available Since 1.8.0#
|The user for which a refresh token has been revoked. See the link:../apis/users[Users API] for property definitions and example JSON.
