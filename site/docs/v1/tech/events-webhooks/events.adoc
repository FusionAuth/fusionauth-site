=== Tenant Scoped Events

Tenant scoped events are generated for all applications in a tenant or for none of them.

All user events are tenant scoped because a user is a tenant scoped entity. For example, the `user.delete`, `user.create`, `user.update`, and `user.deactivate` events are all tenant scoped.

A tenant scoped event can, however contain an `applicationId` which can be used to filter events when received. One example is `user.registration.create`. 

=== Application Scoped Events

A few events can be generated for one or more specified applications, or for all applications within a tenant. 

[WARNING]
====
The ability to limit the generation of an event for only certain applications is legacy functionality and may be modified in the future. If you want to get events for certain applications, send events for a tenant. Filter on the `applicationId` when consuming the event and discard events from any applications that are not of interest.
====

These events can be application scoped:

* `jwt.public-key.update`
* `jwt.refresh-token.revoke`
* `user.action`

=== Transaction Compatibility

Events can be either transactional or non-transactional. The final state of the operation which caused a transaction event is not persisted to FusionAuth until after the configured webhook finishes. Non-transactional events do not require any webhooks to succeed.
