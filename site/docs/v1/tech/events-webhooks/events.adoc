== Events

These are the events that FusionAuth generates that can be optionally consumed by your registered Webhook.

* <<User Actions>> - when a moderator takes an action on a user
* <<User Bulk Create>> - when multiple users are created as the result of the Import API
* <<User Create>> - when a user is created
* <<User Update>> - when a user is updated
* <<User Deactivate>> - when a user is deactivated
* <<User Reactivate>> - when a user is reactivated
* <<User Delete>> - when a user is deleted
* <<User Email Verified>> - when a user verifies their email address
* <<User Login Success>> - when a user successfully completes login
* <<User Login Failure>> - when a user fails to complete login
* <<User Password Breach>> - when Reactor detects a user is using a potentially breached password
* <<User Registration Create>> - when a new user registration is created
* <<User Registration Update>> - when a user registration is update
* <<User Registration Delete>> - when a user registration is deleted
* <<User Registration Verified>> - when a user completes registration verification
* <<JWT Public Key Update>> - when a JWT RSA Public / Private keypair used for signing may have been updated.
* <<JWT Refresh>> - when an access token is refreshed using a refresh token
* <<JWT Refresh Token Revoke>> - when a refresh token (or multiple tokens) are revoked

=== Tenant Scoped Events

Tenant scoped events are generated for all applications in a tenant or for none of them.

All user events are tenant scoped because a user is a tenant scoped entity. For example, the `user.delete`, `user.create`, `user.update`, and `user.deactivate` events are all tenant scoped.

A tenant scoped event can, however contain an `applicationId` which can be used to filter events when received. One example is `user.registration.create`. 

=== Application Scoped Events

A few events can be generated for one or more specified applications, or for all applications within a tenant. 

[WARNING]
====
The ability to limit the generation of an event for only certain applications is legacy functionality and may be modified in the future. If you want to get events for certain applications, send events for a tenant. Filter on the `applicationId` when consuming the event and discard events from any applications that are not of interest.
====

These events can be application scoped:

* `jwt.public-key.update`
* `jwt.refresh-token.revoke`
* `user.action`

== User Actions

This event is generated when a User Action is taken on a user and when temporal actions transition between phases.

A temporal action is one that has a start time and and a duration, when a phase transition occurs an event will be sent to the webhook. See the [field]#event.phase# in the message body.

=== Event Body

[.api]
[field]#event.action# [type]#[String]#::
This parameter specifies the name of the action that is occurring.

[field]#event.actionId# [type]#[UUID]#::
This parameter specifies the unique Id of the action that is occurring.

[field]#event.actioneeUserId# [type]#[UUID]#::
This parameter specifies the unique identifier of the user the action is being performed on.

[field]#event.actionerUserId# [type]#[UUID]#::
This parameter specifies the Id of the User that performed the action that resulted in the notification being sent. If the action was initiated by FusionAuth this value will not be provided.

[field]#event.applicationIds# [type]#[Array<UUID>]#::
This parameter if provided specifies the scope of the User Action. When an Action is scoped to one or more Applications the Application Ids will be provided in this parameter.

[field]#event.comment# [type]#[String]#::
An optional comment left to possibly indicate why the action was taken, modified or canceled.

[field]#event.createInstant# [type]#[Long]#::
The link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/data-types/#instants[instant] that the event was generated.

[field]#event.email# [type]#[Object]#::
When the action is configured to send the email in the event body, FusionAuth will render the email and provide the result in the event body. This can be used to send an email through a third party provider. See Example POST body below for fields.

[field]#event.emailedUser# [type]#[Boolean]#::
This parameter will indicate if FusionAuth has already sent an email to the user as a result of this event. When `true` an email was sent to the user, and if `false` an email was not sent to the user.

[field]#event.expiry# [type]#[Long]#::
The link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/data-types/#instants[instant] that the action will expire, if the action expires.

[field]#event.id# [type]#[UUID]#::
The unique Id of the event. You may receive an event more than once based upon your transaction settings. This Id may be used to identify a duplicate event.

[field]#event.localizedAction# [type]#[String]#::
This parameter specifies the localized version of the [field]#action# field, based on the user's preferred languages.

[field]#event.localizedDuration# [type]#[String]#::
The duration of the action in a human readable format that is localized based on the user's preferred languages.

[field]#event.localizedOption# [type]#[String]#::

This parameter specifies the localized reason of the [field]#reason# field, based on the user's preferred languages.

[field]#event.notifyUser# [type]#[Boolean]#::
This parameter specifies whether the user should be notified. FusionAuth will only set this value based upon the event configuration, it is simply an indicator to the event consumer to notify the user.

[field]#event.option# [type]#[String]#::
An optional value to provide additional context to the Action. This value is free form and defined by the User Action.

[field]#event.phase# [type]#[Boolean]#::
If the Action is temporal, this parameter will be provided to indicate the current phase of the action. The following are the possible Action states:
+
    * `start` - The event has started.
    * `modify` - The event has been modified.
    * `cancel` - The event has been canceled, the `end` phase will not be reached.
    * `end` - The event has ended.
+
When the action is started by an admin, the phase will be "start". If an admin changes the duration of the action, the phase will be "modify". If an admin cancels an action it will be "cancel" or the action expires, the phase will be "end". If the action is key-based, the phase will be "start".

[field]#event.reason# [type]#[String]#::

== JWT Refresh Token Revoke

This event is generated when a refresh token is revoked. The JSON includes either the User Id and User or the Application Id depending on what was revoked. It will also include the time to live duration (in seconds) for each Application. This value is used to determine if JWTs are valid or not based on their expiration instants.

The following scenarios will cause this event to be generated:

* A single Refresh Token is revoked
* All Refresh Tokens owned by a single User are revoked
* All Refresh Tokens for an Application are revoked
