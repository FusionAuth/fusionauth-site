== Overview

Events and Webhooks are a core architecture feature of FusionAuth. This feature provides a publish-subscribe pattern to developers and integrators of FusionAuth. In this architecture pattern, the Webhook is the subscriber and FusionAuth is the publisher.

This system is designed to provide feedback to your system when events occur within FusionAuth. Events are sent via an HTTP `POST` request with a JSON request body. The request will be sent with the a `Content-Type` header of `application/json`. This is the same style of API that the FusionAuth App uses to handle API requests from your application.

See the corresponding link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/webhooks/[Webhook APIs] if you'd prefer to programatically configure FusionAuth Webhooks.

Here are the topics in this section:

* link:/docs/v1/tech/events-webhooks/events/[Events] - Covers all of the event types that FusionAuth sends to Webhooks
* link:/docs/v1/tech/events-webhooks/writing-a-webhook/[Writing a Webhook] - Covers how to write a Webhook that will process events from FusionAuth.
* link:/docs/v1/tech/events-webhooks/securing/[Securing a Webhook] - Covers how to ensure your webhooks are secured properly.

Continue reading below to see how the events and webhooks are configured using the FusionAuth user interface.

== Tenant Settings

To prepare to consume FusionAuth events you'll first need to enable the event globally and select a transaction level that is compatible with your requirements. Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Tenants -> Webhooks# to enable events and optionally modify the default transaction level for each event type.

=== Table columns

[.api]
Event type::
The event type, this value will be present in the JSON request to identify the message.
Enabled::
When enabled this event can be sent by one or more webhook. You will also need to enable the event for a specific webhook to receive the event.
+
This toggle allows you to optionally disable an event for all webhooks all at once.
Transaction setting::
The transaction setting for this event. This setting will apply to all webhooks consuming this event type.
+
+
    [field]#No Webhooks are required to succeed#::
    The event will succeed regardless of the webhook response status code. Use this setting when it is not important for a webhook to succeed or provide confirmation that the event has been received and processed successfully.
    [field]#Any single Webhook must succeed#::
    The event will succeed as long as one or more of the webhooks respond with a status code between `200` and `299` (inclusive).
    [field]#A simple majority of Webhooks must succeed#::
    The event will succeed if at least half of the webhooks respond with a status code between `200` and `299` (inclusive). This means 50% or more of the webhooks must respond successfully.
    [field]#A two-thirds majority of Webhooks must succeed#::
    The event will succeed if a super majority of the webhooks respond with a status code between `200` and `299` (inclusive). A super majority is two-thirds (66.7%) or more of the configured webhooks.
    [field]#All of the Webhooks must succeed#::
    The event will succeed if every configured webhook responds with a status code between `200` and `299` (inclusive). Use this setting when it is critical for every configured webhook to receive and process the event before considering it complete.




== Add Webhook

After you have enabled the events that you will be using, create a webhook definition to indicate where FusionAuth should send the JSON events. Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Webhooks# to create a new webhook.

See the example screenshot below, at a minimum you will need to provide the URL the endpoint that will accept the FusionAuth JSON events. You can see in this screenshot that even though an event may be enabled globally you can still select which events will be sent to this webhook.

If you need to configure an Authorization header or other credentials to allow FusionAuth to make a request to your webhook, you may do so in the Security tab.

=== Form Fields

[.api]
[field]#Id# [optional]#Optional#::
An optional UUID. When this value is omitted a unique Id will be generated automatically.

[field]#URL# [required]#Required#::
The endpoint that FusionAuth will used to send JSON events.

[field]#Connect timeout# [required]#Required# [default]#defaults to `1000` or 1 second#::
The HTTP connect timeout in milliseconds used when connecting to the provided URL.

[field]#Read timeout# [required]#Required# [default]#defaults to `2000` or 2 seconds#::
The HTTP read timeout in milliseconds used when connecting to the provided URL.

[field]#Description# [optional]#Optional#::
An optional description of this webhook.


=== Events

==== Form Fields

[.api]
[field]#Event type#::
The event type that will be provided in the JSON event.

[field]#Enabled#::
This toggle indicates if the event is enabled and may be sent to configured webhooks. This toggle affects all webhooks, a specific webhook may still be configured to ignore this event.


=== Security

The security settings may be used to require authentication in order to submit an event to the webhook.

==== Form Fields

[.api]
[field]#Basic auth username# [optional]#Optional#::
The username to be used for HTTP Basic Authentication.

[field]#Basic auth password# [optional]#Optional#::
The password to be used for HTTP Basic Authentication.

[field]#Certificate# [optional]#Optional#::
The SSL certificate in PEM format to be used when connecting to the webhook. When provided an in memory keystore will be generated in order to complete the `https` connection to the webhook.


=== Applications

image::webhook-settings-applications-selection.png[Webhook Settings - Select Applications,width=1200,role=shadowed bottom-cropped top-cropped]


==== Form Fields

[.api]
All applications::
When this toggle is enabled, all events will be sent to this webhook, events for a specific application.

Applications::
When the [field]#All applications# is disabled, this field will be exposed. Select the application for which you would like to receive events.
+
Not all events are considered application specific and selecting an application will limit you to only receiving application events. The following events are considered Application events:
+
    - `jwt.public-key.update`
    - `jwt.refresh-token.revoke`
    - `user.action`
+
In most cases you will want to use the [field]#All applications# configuration.

=== Headers

image::webhook-settings-headers.png[Webhook Settings - HTTP Headers,width=1200,role=shadowed top-cropped]

==== Form Fields

[.api]
Name::
The name of the header to add to the HTTP request when sending the event to the webhook
Value::
The header value to add to the HTTP request when sending the event to the webhook

== Test a Webhook

Once you have a webhook up and running and configured to receive JSON events from FusionAuth you may wish to test it by sending different events. FusionAuth has built in a test capability to allow you to construct any event and send it to your webhook.

Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Webhooks# and select the purple icon:exchange[Test button,width=28,role=ui-button purple,type=fas] icon for the webhook you wish to test. Select the event type to test, optionally modify the JSON to test a specific scenario and then use the send button in the top right to send the event to the webhook.

image::webhook-test.png[Webhook Test,width=1200,role=shadowed]

=== Form Fields

[.api]
[field]#URL# [read-only]#Read-Only#::
The URL of the webhook you are testing. If you wish to test a different webhook return to the webhook menu and select the test action on another webhook.

Event type::
The selected event type to send to the webhook.

Event::
The JSON event to send to the webhook. This is a generated example and it may be modified before sending to replicate a specific scenario.
