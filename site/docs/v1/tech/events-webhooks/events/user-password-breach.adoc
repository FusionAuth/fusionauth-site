== User Password Breach

[NOTE.since]
====
This event has been available since 1.15.0
====

This event is generated when Reactor detects a user is using a vulnerable, or breached password. This event will only occur during login when the Tenant is not configured to require the user to change their password. All other breached password detections will occur during password validation and because the user will not be allowed to use the password.
