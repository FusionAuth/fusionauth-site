=== Tenant Scoped Events

Tenant scoped events are generated for all applications in a tenant or for none of them.

All user events are tenant scoped because a user is a tenant scoped entity. For example, the `user.delete`, `user.create`, `user.update`, and `user.deactivate` events are all tenant scoped.

A tenant scoped event can, however contain an `applicationId` which can be used to filter events when received. One example is `user.registration.create`.

=== Application Scoped Events

=== Transaction Compatibility

Events can be either transactional or non-transactional. The final state of the operation which caused a transaction event is not persisted to FusionAuth until after the configured webhook finishes. Non-transactional events do not require any webhooks to succeed.
