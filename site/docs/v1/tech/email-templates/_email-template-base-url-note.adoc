[NOTE.note]
====
The email templates ship with a base URL of `http://localhost:9011`. While this is fine for local development, for production modify the base URLs to a publicly accessible value, such as `https://auth.example.com`.

There is currently no support for changing the base URL globally, though there is an https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/457[open feature request].
