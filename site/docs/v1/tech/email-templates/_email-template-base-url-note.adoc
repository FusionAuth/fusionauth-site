[NOTE.note]
====
The email templates ship with a base URL of `http://localhost:9011` for links, such as the verify email or change password link. While this works for local development, for production, make sure modify all template base URLs to a public URL, such as `https://auth.example.com`.

One option is to store a base URL value on the [field]#tenant.data# object. For example, set [field]#tenant.data.baseEmailURL# to `https://auth.example.com`, and then access it from each email template.

There is currently no support for changing the base URL globally, though there is an https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/457[open feature request].
