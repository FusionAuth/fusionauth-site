====
The email templates ship with a base URL of `http://localhost:9011` for links, such as the verify email or change password link.

While this works for local development, for production, make sure modify all template base URLs to a public URL, such as `https://auth.example.com`.

There is currently no support for changing the base URL globally, though there is an https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/457[open feature request].
