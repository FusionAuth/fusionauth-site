=== SendGrid

SendGrid is a commonly used SMTP provider and integrates well with FusionAuth. To setup SendGrid, https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/integrating-with-the-smtp-api[follow these instructions].

Other resources related to SendGrid are linked below:

1. https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/getting-started-with-transactional-emails
2. https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/sender-identity
3. https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication

Using dedicated IP addresses for any SendGrid account will build email reputation over time (improving email deliverability). And lastly, to control spoofing, phishing, and spam, it is recommended to set up link:https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/spf-records[SPF] and link:https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/dkim-records[DKIM] records for the primary email domain (such as `example-company.com`). Emails should also be sent from an address such as `no-reply@example-company.com`.

=== Gmail

Gmail is a commonly used SMTP service. Gmail is not recommended for production use, since it has a https://support.google.com/a/answer/166852[number of limits]. However, it can be useful to test email functionality.

For Gmail, use https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833[application passwords], otherwise you may get a generic `Unable to send email via JavaMail / Prime Messaging Exception` error.
