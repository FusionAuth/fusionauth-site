SendGrid is a commonly used email provider and integrates well with FusionAuth. To setup SendGrid, please follow the instructions below:

- https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/integrating-with-the-smtp-api

Using dedicated IP addresses for any SendGrid account will build email reputation over time (improving email deliverability). And lastly, to control spoofing, phishing, and spam, it is recommended to set up link:https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/spf-records[SPF] and link:https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/dkim-records[DKIM] records for the primary email domain (such as `example-company.com`). Emails should also be sent from an address such as `no-reply@example-company.com`.
