== Overview

FusionAuth will use email templates to send a Forgot Password request, and other built in workflows. You may also create your own
email templates and send them to Users via the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/emails#send-an-email[Send Email] API.

== Managing Templates

FusionAuth ships with several templates to support Forgot Password, Setup Password, Verify Email and other workflows. You will want to modify these templates prior to using them in production.

Apart from modifying them to be more cosmetically pleasing or to match your brand, you will need to ensure the URL used in the template is correct. You will need to ensure the URL is publicly accessible.

When you first log into FusionAuth and navigate to [breadcrumb]#Customizations -> Email Templates# you will see the following templates.

For example, below is the email body of the Email Verification template as it is shipped with FusionAuth.

At a minimum, you will need to update this URL to a publicly accessible URL that can reach FusionAuth.

If you will be handling Email Verification yourself, you will need to update this URL to be that of your own. You will notice the one replacement variable in this template named `${verificationId}`. See the Replacement Variables section below for additional detail, but these variables will be replaced when the template is rendered.

== Localization

The email template body (both HTML and text values), subject, and from name fields can be localized.

You can associate these values with a locale. If a user has a preferred language, the localized template will be used when this email is sent.
