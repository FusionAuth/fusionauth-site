== Overview

Email templates are utilized by FusionAuth to send a Forgot Password request, and other built in workflows. You may also create your own
email templates and send them to Users via the link:../apis/emails#send-an-email[Send Email] API.

== Email Templates

FusionAuth ships with three templates to support Forgot Password, Setup Password and Verify Email workflows. You will need to modify these
templates prior to using them in production.

Apart from modifying them to be more cosmetically pleasing or to match your brand, you will need to ensure the URL used in the template is
correct. You will need to ensure the URL is publicly accessible.

When you first log into FusionAuth and navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb,type=fas] [breadcrumb]#Email Templates# you
will see the following seven templates.

For example, below is the email body of the Email Verification template as it is shipped with FusionAuth.

image::stock-verify-email-template.png[Stock Verify Email Template,width=1200,role=shadowed]

At a minimum, you will need to update this URL to a publicly accessible URL that can reach FusionAuth.

If you will be handling Email Verification yourself, you will need to update this URL to be that of your own. You will notice the one
replacement variable in this template named `${verificationId}`. See the Replacement Variables section below for additional detail, but these
variables will be replaced when the template is rendered.

.Base Information
|===
|Id
|The unique Id of the email template. The template Id may not be changed and will be used to interact with the template when using the
Email APIs.

|Name [required]#Required#
|The name of the template. This value is for display purposes only and can be changed at any time.

|Default Subject [required]#Required#
|The default subject of the email. The default value will be used unless a localized version is found to be a better match based upon
the User's preferred locales.

This field supports replacement variables.

|From Email [required]#Required#
|The from email address used to send this template.

|Default from Name [optional]#Optional#
|The default from name of the email. The default value will be used unless a localized version is found to be a better match based upon
the User's preferred locales.

This field supports replacement variables.

== Templates & Replacement Variables

The email template body, subject and from name fields support replacement variables. This means place holders can be inserted and the value
will be calculated at the time the email template is rendered and sent to a user.

Each template will contain the User object as returned on the Retrieve User API. This means you can utilize any value found on the User object
such as email, first name, last name, etc.

In addition to the User object, the templates used for Email Verification, Forgot Password and Setup Password will also contain an identifier
that will be used to complete the request.

Below you will find each stock template that FusionAuth ships for reference.

== Using Replacement Variables

Below are some basic examples of using replacement values in your email templates.

Consider the following User represented by this condensed JSON object.
[source,json]
----
{
  "email": "monica@piedpiper.com",
  "firstName": "Monica",
  "id": "1c592f8a-59c6-4a09-82f8-f4257e3ea4c8",
  "lastName": "Hall"
}
----

The following are example usages with a rendered output based upon the above mentioned example User. The replacement variables are rendered
using https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/index.html[Apache FreeMarker] which is an HTML template language.

A default value should be provided for variables that may be undefined at runtime such as `firstName`. See `firstName` in the example below
is followed by a bang `!` and then the string `Unknown User`. This indicates that if `firstName` is undefined when the template is rendered the value
of `Unknown User` should be used as a default value.

*Template Source*
[source,html]
----
Hi ${user.firstName!'Unknown User'}, welcome to Pied Piper.

Please verify your email address ${user.email} by following the provided link.

https://piedpiper.fusionauth.io/email/verify/${verificationId}

- Admin

== Custom Replacement Variables

In addition to the variables mentioned in the previous section, when defining your own email templates to be used by the link:../apis/emails#send-an-email[Send Email] API
custom data may be provided on the API request to be used in the email template.

On Send Email API request the contents of the `requestData` field will be made available to you when the template is rendered.

For example, consider the following request to the Send API to send email template Id `1bc118ae-d5fa-4cdf-a90e-e8ef55c3e11e` to the User by Id `ce485a91-906f-4615-af75-81d37dc71e90`.
