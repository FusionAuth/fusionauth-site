== External JWT Reconcile lambda

When an External JWT identity provider is used to complete a federated login request FusionAuth will use the email address to reconcile user. You may optionally utilize a lambda to customize the user and user registration during this authentication event.

When you create a new lambda using the FusionAuth UI we will provide you an empty function for you to implement.

If you are using the API to create the lambda you will need to ensure your function has the following signature:

[source,javascript]
----
function reconcile(user, registration, jwt)  {
  // Lambda code goes here
}
----

This lambda must contain a function named `reconcile` that takes three parameters. The parameters that the lambda is passed are:

include::docs/v1/tech/lambdas/_reconcile-lambda-user-registration-parameters.adoc[]
* `jwt` - the JSON payload returned by the external identity provider JWT. This is read-only.

The two FusionAuth objects are well documented here in the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/users[User API] and link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/registrations[Registration API] documentation. The `jwt` may contain various user claims to utilize during the reconcile process.

== Assigning the lambda

Once a lambda is created, you may assign it to the External JWT identity provider in the IdP configuration.

Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Identity Providers# and select your existing External JWT configuration or click [breadcrumb]#Add provider# and select External JWT if it has not yet been configured.

== Example lambda

The following is a simple example of an External JWT reconcile lambda. You will need to modify it to suit your needs.

[source,javascript]
----
// This is an example External JWT reconcile, modify this to your liking.
function reconcile(user, registration, jwt) {
  // User claims
  user.firstName = jwt.first_name;
  user.lastName = jwt.last_name;
  user.birthDate = jwt.birth_date;
  user.imageUrl = jwt.image_url;

  user.data = user.data || {};
  user.data['email'] = jwt.email;

  // Registration claims
  registration.data = registration.data || {};
  registration.data['iss'] = jwt.iss;
}
