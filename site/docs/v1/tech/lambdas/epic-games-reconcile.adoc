== Epic Games Reconcile lambda

This lambda reconciles a user in conjunction with an Epic Games IdP.

When you create a new lambda using the FusionAuth UI we will provide you an empty function for you to implement.

If you are using the API to create the lambda you will need to ensure your function has the following signature:

[source,javascript]
----
function reconcile(user, registration, userInfo) {
  // Lambda code goes here
}
----

This lambda must contain a function named `reconcile` that takes the following parameters. The parameters that the lambda is passed are:

include::docs/v1/tech/lambdas/_reconcile-lambda-user-registration-parameters.adoc[]
* `userInfo` - data returned by the Epic Games Account API. This is read-only.
* `accessToken` - the JSON payload returned by the Epic Token API. This is read-only.

The two FusionAuth objects are well documented here in the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/users[User API] and link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/registrations[Registration API] documentation. The `idToken` may contain various user claims depending upon the user's Epic Games configuration.

== Assigning the lambda

Once a lambda is created, you may assign it to the Epic Games identity provider in the IdP configuration.

Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Identity Providers# and select your existing Epic Games configuration or click [breadcrumb]#Add provider# and select Epic Games if it has not yet been configured.
