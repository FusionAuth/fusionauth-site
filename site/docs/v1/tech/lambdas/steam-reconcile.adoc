== Steam Reconcile lambda

This lambda reconciles a user in conjunction with a Steam IdP.

When you create a new lambda using the FusionAuth UI we will provide you an empty function for you to implement.

If you are using the API to create the lambda you will need to ensure your function has the following signature:

[source,javascript]
----
function reconcile(user, registration, userInfo) {
  // Lambda code goes here
}
----

This lambda must contain a function named `reconcile` that takes three parameters. The parameters that the lambda is passed are:

include::docs/v1/tech/lambdas/_reconcile-lambda-user-registration-parameters.adoc[]
* `userInfo` - the JSON payload returned by the Steam Token Details API. This is read-only.

The two FusionAuth objects are well documented here in the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/users[User API] and link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/registrations[Registration API] documentation. The `userInfo` may contain various user claims depending upon the user's Steam configuration.

== Assigning the lambda

Once a lambda is created, you may assign it to the Steam identity provider in the IdP configuration.

Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Identity Providers# and select your existing Steam configuration or click [breadcrumb]#Add provider# and select Steam if it has not yet been configured.
