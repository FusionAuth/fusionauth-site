== Overview

This is a basic example to get started configuring Azure AD as a SCIM client and establish a connection between FusionAuth and Azure AD for provisioning purposes.

For complete documentation, please refer to the Azure AD provisioning documentation.

To configure the integration, in the Microsoft Azure console, navigate to *Azure AD* and click on *Enterprise Applications* and either create a new application, or select the application you will be using for SCIM provisioning. Once you have selected the application, click on *Provisioning* in the left navigation under the *Manage* section.

Here you will find an *Update Credentials* option in the *Manage Provisioning* section at the bottom of the page. Expand the *Admin Credentials* section find the required configuration fields.
