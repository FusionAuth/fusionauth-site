== Overview

WebAuthn, commonly called "passkey", is a new method of authentication for web applications. It's a widely supported standard.

With WebAuthn, your end users get:

* lower friction for a better user experience
* more security through phishing resistance

All major browsers support it, so developers can incorporate WebAuthn into web applications without worrying about incompatibilities.

At this time, FusionAuth supports first factor authentication with WebAuthn. It can be configured on a per-tenant basis. FusionAuth supports both platform authenticators, such as FaceID and TouchID, and cross-platform authenticators such as YubiKeys.

Users can associate WebAuthn passkeys to increase the security of their account using account management functionality.
