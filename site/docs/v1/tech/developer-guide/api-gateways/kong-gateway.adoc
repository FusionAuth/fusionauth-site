== Overview

Kong Gateway is an API management tool that allows you to connect client API calls to the appropriate services.

You can configure Kong Gateway to handle authorization to the services through JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) issued on behalf of a user authenticated by an identity provider.

In this document, you'll learn how to set up Kong Gateway with FusionAuth as the identity provider to protect a simple HTTP service.

== Prerequisites

* A FusionAuth instance running on a publicly accessible URL. You can spin up a link:/pricing[basic FusionAuth Cloud instance] or link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/[install it on any server].
* A Kong Gateway instance with service routes. You can follow the Kong quickstart guide at link:https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/3.1.x/get-started/[to set up Kong locally]. You should complete both the link:https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/3.1.x/get-started/[Get Kong] and link:https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/3.1.x/get-started/services-and-routes/[Services and Routes] sections.
** Note: If the terminal seems to hang after outputting `Debugging info logged to 'kong-quickstart.log'`, it may be having trouble connecting to Docker. Try link:https://www.kindacode.com/article/how-to-reset-docker-desktop/[resetting Docker to factory defaults] to solve this issue.

== Restrict Access to your Kong Gateway Service

After following the Kong Quickstart Guide above, you can execute the following command in the terminal.

[source,shell,title="Curl to test Kong setup"]
----
curl -I http://localhost:8000/mock/requests
----

If you have correctly set up Kong Gateway, this command will return `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`, indicating a successful connection to the service.

Now, you can restrict access to the service by requiring a JWT. To do this, add a link:https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/jwt/[JWT plugin] to the Kong service with the following command. We assume the service name is "example_service", as in the Kong Get Started guide.

[source,shell,title="Restricting access with JWT"]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/example_service/plugins \
    --data "name=jwt"
----

At this point, the service is inaccessible without a token. To confirm this, you can execute:

[source,shell,title="Curl to test Kong setup after restricting access"]
----
curl -I http://localhost:8000/mock/requests
----

This time, the command will return `HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized`.

== Set Up FusionAuth

Navigate to your FusionAuth instance.

First, you need to make sure the JWT issuer setting is correct. Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Tenants -> Your Tenant# and change the [field]#Issuer# field to the URL of your FusionAuth instance, for example, `\https://local.fusionauth.io`. Record this value, because you will use it later when generating the JWT.

Next, you need to configure an application that will issue tokens to access the Kong Gateway service.

Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Applications# and create a new application. Fill out the [field]#Name# field, then click the [breadcrumb]#JWT# tab and toggle the [field]#Enabled# switch. Select [uielement]#Auto generate a new key on save...# for the [field]#Access Token signing key# field. This will generate an RS256 asymmetric key pair specifically for this application.

image::api-gateways/kong-gateway/kong-gateway-fusionauth-jwt-settings.png[FusionAuth application JWT settings,width=1200]

Click the [uielement]#Save# button.

After saving the application, find the application in the list of applications and click [uielement]#View# next to the application you just created. Here you will find the application [field]#Id#. Note this value, as we will refer to it later as `APPLICATION_ID`.

image::api-gateways/kong-gateway/kong-gateway-application-id.png[FusionAuth Application Id, width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Now, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Key Master#. You will see the access key that you've just created in this list. By default, it has the name `Access token signing key generated for application <NAME_OF_APPLICATION>`. View the key and copy the entire contents of the [field]#PEM encoded# field under the [breadcrumb]#Public Key# section into a file in your current working directory. Name the file something like `public.pem`

You will use FusionAuth's API to generate a test JWT for your application. However, in a real world application, the user or service would get the JWT through an OAuth grant. In the case of a user, the appropriate grant is the Authorization Code grant, and for a service, the Client Credentials grant. To make this example simpler, you'll use the Login API to get the JWT. To do this, you need an API key with POST access to the `/api/login` endpoint. Go to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> API Keys# to add the key. Make sure the appropriate tenant is selected in the [field]#Tenant# field.

image::api-gateways/kong-gateway/kong-gateway-api-key-setup.png[FusionAuth API Key setup, width=1200]

After saving the API key, you can view the key in the list of API keys. Make a note of the value of the [field]#Key# field. You will need to click the red padlock icon next to the key to reveal the value.

Finally, make sure there is at least one user registered to your application so that you can test with a JWT issued for that user. You can create a new user by navigating to [breadcrumb]#Users -> Add user#. Untoggle the [field]#Send email to set up password# switch to manually enter a password in the [field]#Password# field.

image::api-gateways/kong-gateway/kong-gateway-create-user.png[FusionAuth User Creation, width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

After saving this user, click [uielement]#Manage# and go to the [breadcrumb]#Registrations# tab. Click [uielement]#Add Registration# to register the user to your application.

== Add a Consumer in Kong Gateway

Now that FusionAuth has all the requisite information to create a JWT, you can configure your Kong Gateway and JWT plugin to provide access based on valid tokens created by FusionAuth.

Execute the following command in your terminal to add a consumer to Kong.

[source,shell,title="Creating a consumer"]
----
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8001/consumers \
  --data "username=fusionauth"
----

This command creates a Kong consumer with the username `fusionauth`. This consumer will be linked to the authentication information that you supply to it, namely the [field]#Public key# and [field]#Issuer# name from FusionAuth. This consumer uses the information provided to verify any JWT used to access the service. You can enable this with the following command:

[source,shell,title="Supply key to consumer"]
----
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8001/consumers/<CONSUMER_USERNAME>/jwt \
  -F "algorithm=RS256" \
  -F "rsa_public_key=@./<PUBLIC_KEY_FILENAME>" \
  -F "key=<YOUR_FUSIONAUTH_URL>"
----

Here, `YOUR_FUSIONAUTH_URL` should exactly match the [field]#Issuer# field from [breadcrumb]#Tenants -> Your Tenant#, `CONSUMER_USERNAME` should match the [field]#username# that you supplied to the consumer in the prior step, and `PUBLIC_KEY_FILENAME` should match the name of the file that you saved the public key to, from the [breadcrumb]#Key Master# page.

Using the example values from this guide, the command would be:

[source,shell,title="Supply key to consumer with example values"]
----
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8001/consumers/fusionauth/jwt \
  -F "algorithm=RS256" \
  -F "rsa_public_key=@./public.pem" \
  -F "key=https://local.fusionauth.io"
----

== Creating and Using the Service with a JWT

You can now generate a test JWT to access your Kong Gateway service using FusionAuth's login API. Execute the following command in your terminal.

[source,shell,title="Get JWT token from FusionAuth"]
----
curl --location --request POST '<YOUR_FUSIONAUTH_URL>/api/login' \
--header 'Authorization: <API_KEY>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '  {
    "loginId": "<USER_EMAIL>",
    "password": "<USER_PASSWORD>",
    "applicationId": "<APPLICATION_ID>",
    "noJWT" : false
  }'
----

Here, `YOUR_FUSIONAUTH_URL` is the [field]#Issuer# name, and `API_KEY` is the key you noted when setting it up on the [breadcrumb]#Settings -> API Keys# page.

For `APPLICATION_ID`, use the Id of your FusionAuth application.

The values for `USER_EMAIL` and `USER_PASSWORD` are the username and password of the test user that you registered to that application.

Using the example names from this guide, the command will appear as follows:

[source,shell,title="Get JWT token from FusionAuth with example values"]
----
curl --location --request POST 'https://local.fusionauth.io/api/login' \
--header 'Authorization: cQoB7kVu9h4lI8cCMzjfeOyZFevj_suDRDKnVzh1SK1aPSlvzjyNIVnh' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '  {
    "loginId": "richard@example.com",
    "password": "password",
    "applicationId": "6245b444-bd51-4be2-9260-7dc825adbcb6",
    "noJWT" : false
  }'
----

The return response from FusionAuth should look similar to the following:

[source,json,title="Token response from API call"]
----
{
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6ImhDUjA4X3daR2s0OUFlYUFmRDY5ZmJKWmRGTSJ9.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.m7gzXhNLToPNVE1p5Vo2pLgP6WBcPNfS_zZJnJ81mdEgi6-orViz-tU8j0L8wva0-8KlMdy54cq_XjnDnYJ0aX90O4ZE_QVU5NuDDfzXH14wQtKQoIIydsB6ZvQoBt8JNFUHJb9ANLCGnfn6FVQKqPIzye18Gx_7wYSVokw3eLNFyzrq9dwOD5Q8V9gvZmXV2pTokQAtA7qFaadb2dIeFlSEB7wamKiZLXILjeWAeMbbvAAMQZWFh46UJjwr06QTd8PxQmRwDWWznJy1Vs8EAgZA4vkRSWnn3IbiaCtOaL1ANuEex6il7q32ahxj0Ncm9wn0DbDsQE9NB0CCNTSIhA",
    "tokenExpirationInstant": 1673366204805,
    "user": {
        "sampleuserdata" : "..."
    }
}
----

Copy the [field]#token# value. You can now gain access to your Kong Gateway service by passing this value as a bearer token.

[source,shell,title="Gain access with JWT"]
----
curl -I http://localhost:8000/mock/requests \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>'
----

Where `TOKEN` is the value of the JWT that you copied from the `/api/login` call.

This command should return `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`, indicating successful authorization to the Kong Gateway service.

=== Next steps

You've learned how to enable JWT authorization on a Kong service. In a production application, using Kong and the JWT plugin is useful to secure backend services of the application. This way, each service does not need to handle authorization or authentication. Instead, authentication and authorization are handled by FusionAuth and Kong.

You used the FusionAuth API to create a test token on behalf of a user. For a production system, the token will generally be generated after a user signs in to your application through a frontend. Check out some of our framework integration tutorials to implement that:
