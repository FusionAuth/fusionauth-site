== Overview

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. If you are already using Tailwind CSS in your application, you can integrate it into FusionAuth.

== Prerequisites

* Node.js 18 or later

== Setting up FusionAuth

Create a new theme by navigating to [breadcrumb]#Customization -> Themes# and then click the [uielement]#Add# button. Enter a [field]#Name# for the theme and click the [uielement]#Save# button.

Create a new API key with permissions to modify the theme. You can do this by going to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> API Keys#. Then click the [uielement]#Add# button and select `GET` and `PATCH` permissions for `/api/theme/`.

== Installation

We are going to use the FusionAuth Theme Helper project as a starting point.

First, clone the FusionAuth Theme Helper project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-theme-helper
```

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the values:
```bash
API_KEY=OjgmZzp5Cg_osynwHOATFV9368lRlP0e_imhsTtl5arxym9ymhHvKQ_o # the API key with permissions to modify the theme
THEME_ID=5d175a65-71f2-489a-a6d2-89adad4f5b00 # your theme's UUID
FUSIONAUTH_URL=http://localhost:9011 # your FusionAuth server, including the protocol and hostname, but no paths
TMP_DIR=src # a temporary directory; this will be created
```

To initially download the theme from FusionAuth, run the following command:
```bash
./download.sh
```

Next, install the dependencies and add `tailwindcss`:
```bash
npm install
npm install tailwindcss@3
npx tailwindcss init
```

This will install Tailwind CSS and create a `tailwind.config.js` file in the project root. You can customize the configuration as needed.

Change the `tailwind.config.js` to handle the FreeMarker template files in the `src` directory:
```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/*.ftl'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Create a new stylesheet `input.css` in the root directory:
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

This stylesheet will be used to import the Tailwind CSS base, components, and utilities. Additionally, you can add custom classes to this stylesheet as well.

Currently, the theme is using the `fusionauth-style.css` hosted in the FusionAuth instance. This could conflict with our Tailwind CSS file. To fix this, we need to remove the following line from the `src/helpers.ftl` file - it should be around line number 85:
```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/fusionauth-style.css?version=${version}"/>
```

Finally, we add a new script to the `package.json` file:
```json
"scripts": {
  "watch": "node --dns-result-order ipv4first ./startwatch.js",
  "watch:tailwind": "npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./src/styles.css --watch"
},
```

This script will build the Tailwind CSS file and output it to the `src` directory.

At this point, we have prepared the project to build the Tailwind CSS file and upload the theme to FusionAuth. To apply the changes in the `helper.ftl` file, run the following command:
```bash
./upload.sh
```

== Usage

There are now two scripts that can be used to build the Tailwind CSS file and upload the theme to FusionAuth:

* `npm run watch` — watch the template directory for changes and upload the theme to FusionAuth
* `npm run watch:tailwind` — watch the template directory for changes and rebuild the Tailwind CSS file

If you start both scripts in separate terminal windows, you can edit the template files, which rebuild the Tailwind CSS file, and automatically upload the theme to FusionAuth.

Now if we use a Tailwind CSS class in a template, it will be included in the CSS file:
```html
<div class="bg-gray-200">
  <h1 class="text-2xl">Hello World</h1>
</div>
```

To preview the changes, open FusionAuth, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Customization -> Themes#. Choose your theme, then click [uielement]#Preview#.

== Integrate DaisyUI

There are many Tailwind CSS UI component libraries available. In this example, we are going to use DaisyUI.

DaisyUI is a Tailwind CSS plugin that provides a set of pre-built components and utilities to build beautiful and responsive websites. It supports color theming, light and dark mode, and RTL.

To integrate DaisyUI, install the plugin:
```bash
npm install daisyui
```

Then add the plugin to the `tailwind.config.js`:
```js
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/*.ftl'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [
    require('daisyui'),
  ],
}
```

Now you can use the DaisyUI components in the FreeMarker template files:
```html
<div class="bg-gray-200">
  <h1 class="text-2xl">Hello World</h1>
  <div class="p-4">
    <button class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

For an example integration, see link:https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-theme-tailwind-daisyui/[FusionAuth + Tailwind + DaisyUI Repository on GitHub].

The example repository has light and dark mode setup, and includes updated templates for the following pages:

* Log in
* Log out
* Registration
* Forgot password

In this repository, you could change the color scheme simply by updating the `tailwind.config.js` file:
```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/*.ftl'],
  theme: {
    extend: {
        keyframes: {
            progressBar: {
                "0%": {
                    width: "0%",
                },
                "100%": {
                    width: "100%",
                }
            }
        },
        animation: {
            progressBar: "progressBar 10s ease-in 1",
        }
    },
  },
  plugins: [require("daisyui")],

  daisyui: {
      themes: [
          'corporate',
          {
            business: {
                ...require("daisyui/src/colors/themes")["[data-theme=business]"],
                'primary': '#c891f2'
            }
          }
      ],
      darkTheme: 'business',
  }
}
```
