== Overview

FusionAuth themes allow you to customize the OAuth2 / OpenID Connect login pages and other user workflows such as forgot password. In FusionAuth you may create one to many themes and assign a theme per tenant so that you can customize the user experience for different users.

In this guide you will find a video demonstration, a list of each template available to you and some example code.

* <<Handling Failures>>

== Example Video

To demonstrate what is possible with the FusionAuth feature we have created a video that illustrates how to make FusionAuth look like StackOverflow.

== Create a Theme

FusionAuth provides the ability to create and manage themes in the UI as well as a link:../apis/themes[Themes API] if you prefer to manage themes programatically. Any user of the FusionAuth role of `admin` or `theme_manager` may view, edit, update, and delete Themes.

All of the FusionAuth login templates are written in https://freemarker.apache.org[FreeMarker]. FreeMarker provides a very rich template language that will allow you to customize the pages and helpers to suit your needs. You can also define new macros and function to assist you further.

Below is an example screenshot of the Add Theme panel with each template described below.

=== Form Fields

[.api]
[field]#Id# [optional]#Optional#::
An optional UUID. When this value is omitted a unique Id will be generated automatically.

[field]#Name# [required]#Required#::
A unique name to identity the theme. This name is for display purposes only and it can be modified later if desired.


=== Templates

[.api]
[field]#Stylesheet (CSS)# [optional]#Optional#::
This CSS stylesheet may be used to style the themed pages.
+
This CSS will be included in the `head` tag in the Helpers `head` macro. You may also choose to include other remote stylesheets by using the `<style>` tag within the `head` macro.
+
```
<style>
  ${theme.stylesheet()}
</style>
```

[field]#Messages# [optional]#Optional#::
This section allows you to add additional localized messages to your theme. When creating an additional locale it is not required that all messages are defined for each language. If a message key is not defined for the specified locale, the value from the default bundles will be used.
+
If you intend to localize your login templates, you may find our community contributed and maintained messages in our GitHub repository.
https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-localization

[field]#Helpers# [required]#Required#::
This template contains all of the main helper macros to define the `head`, `body` and `footer`. To begin theming FusionAuth you'll want to start with this template as it will affect all other templates.
+
See <<Helpers>> section below for additional information.

[field]#Email verification complete# [required]#Required#::
This page is used after a user has verified their email address by clicking the URL in the email. After FusionAuth has updated their user object to indicate that their email was verified, the browser is redirected to this page.
+
[uri]#/email/complete#

[field]#Email verification re-send# [required]#Required#::
This page is used after a user has asked for the verification email to be resent. This can happen if the URL in the email expired and the user clicked it. In this case, the user can provide their email address again and FusionAuth will resend the email. After the user submits their email and FusionAuth re-sends a verification email to them, the browser is redirected to this page.
+
[uri]#/email/send#

[field]#Email verification# [required]#Required#::
This page is rendered when a user clicks the URL from the verification email and the `verificationId` has expired. FusionAuth expires `verificationId` after a period of time (which is configurable). If the user has a URL from the verification email that has expired, this page will be rendered and the error will be displayed to the user.
+
[uri]#/email/verify#

[field]#OAuth authorize# [required]#Required#::
This is the main login page for FusionAuth and is used for all interactive OAuth2 and OpenID Connect workflows.
+
[uri]#/oauth2/authorize#

[field]#OAuth child registration not allowed# [required]#Required#::
This page contains a form where a child must provide their parent's email address to ask their parent to create an account for them in a Consent workflow.
+
[uri]#/oauth2/child-registration-not-allowed#

[field]#OAuth child registration not allowed complete# [required]#Required#::

[field]#OAuth device complete# [required]#Required# [since]#Since 1.12.0#::
This page contains a complete message indicating the device authentication has completed.
+
[uri]#/oauth2/device-complete#

[field]#OAuth error# [required]#Required#::
This page is used if the user starts or is in the middle of the OAuth workflow and any type of error occurs. This could be caused by the user messing with the URL or internally some type of information wasn't passed between the OAuth endpoints correctly. For example, if you are federating login to an external IdP and that IdP does not properly echo the `state` parameter, FusionAuth's OAuth workflow will break and this page will be displayed.
+
[uri]#/oauth2/error#

[field]#OAuth logout# [required]#Required#::
This page is used if the user initiates a logout. This page causes the user to be logged out of all associated applications via a front-channel mechanism before being redirected.

After the user submits their email and FusionAuth re-sends a verification email to them, the browser is redirected to this page.
+
[uri]#/registration/send#

[field]#Verify registration# [required]#Required#::
This page is used when a user clicks the URL from the application specific verification email and the `verificationId` has expired. FusionAuth expires `verificationId` after a period of time (which is configurable).

== Helpers

In addition to the pages listed above, FusionAuth has a template that contains a number of macros used in all of the page templates. This template is located at `../_helpers.ftl` and it contains a number of FreeMarker macros. The rest of the pages use these macros to generate various pieces of the HTML. The macros contained in `_helpers.ftl` are:

=== Section Helpers

* `html`
** Renders the `<html>` element
* `head`
** Renders the `<head>` element and everything inside it including the `<title>`, CSS, Java Script, and meta information
* `body`
** Renders the `<body>` element
* `header`
** Renders any type of header for each page. This could be a navigation bar, side bar, or page details
* `main`
** Renders the main content body of each page. If all of your pages will have similar HTML elements like a container, this is the place to put them.
* `footer`
** Renders the footer content of each page. This might contain links, nav, privacy policies, etc.

Here is an example of what one of these helpers looks like:

[source,html]
.HTML helper
----
[#macro html]
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  [#nested/]
</html>
[/#macro]
----

The key to these macros is the `[#nested/]` element. This is the location that FreeMarker will insert any nested content when you use the macro. Here is an example of using this macro:

[source,html]
.Example usage of HTML macro
----
[@helpers.html]
<body>
Hello world!
</body>
[/@helpers.html]
----

Everything inside the macro will be place where the `[#nested/]` element is. Therefore, the result of our example would be this HTML:

[source,html]
.Example result
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
Hello world!
</body>
</html>
----

All of the page templates use these macros, which makes it much easier to style all of the pages at one time. You simply edit the macros and your changes will take effect on all of the pages listed above.

=== Social (alternative) Login Helpers

In addition to the section helpers, the `_helpers.ftl` template also contains a few additional macros that can be used to setup social and alternative logins. Currently, FusionAuth supports these social login providers:

* Facebook
* Google
* Twitter
* Generic OpenID Connect
* Generic SAML v2

Once you have configured your alternative logins (called identity providers in the interface and API), they will appear on the FusionAuth stock login form. This is because our stock login form includes this code:

[source,html]
.Social login code
----
[@helpers.head]
  [@helpers.alternativeLoginsScript clientId=client_id identityProviders=identityProviders/]
  ...
[/@helpers.head]

[@helpers.body]
  ...

  [@helpers.alternativeLogins clientId=client_id identityProviders=identityProviders/]
[/@helpers.body]
----

The first macro (`alternativeLoginScripts`) includes the JavaScript libraries that FusionAuth uses to hook up the identity providers. Unless you want to write your own JavaScript or use a third-party library, you will need this JavaScript in the `<head>` tag in order for FusionAuth to leverage external login providers.

The second macro (`alternativeLogins`) produces the login buttons for each of the configured identity providers. These buttons are all hooked up to the JavaScript included in the `<head>` of the page in order to make it all work nicely.

You might want to use your own buttons for social logins. This is possible with FusionAuth, but you will need to do a couple of things to make it all work.

First, you need to remove the `[@helpers.alternativeLogins]` macro call.

Second, you need to use a specific `id` or `class` on your HTML element for the button. Here are the `id` s or `class` es for each identity provider:

* `id="google-login-button"` is used for Google
* `id="facebook-login-button"` is used for Facebook
* `id="twitter-login-button"` is used for Twitter
* `class="openid login-button"` is used for Generic OpenID Connect
* `class="samlv2 login-button"` is used for Generic SAML v2

And finally, you need to ensure that Prime.js is included on your page. This library ships with FusionAuth and you just need to ensure it is included like this:

[source,html]
.Prime.js include
----
<script src="/js/prime-min.js"></script>
----

=== Alert and Error Helpers

The `_helpers.ftl` template also provides a couple of macros that can be used to output errors and alerts that might occur. The best bet is to include these macros in your `main` macro. Here are the macros and their purpose:

* `printErrorAlerts`
** This outputs any error alerts. These are normally displayed at the top of the page and you might want to make them able to be dismiss (i.e. removed from the page).
* `printInfoAlerts`
** This outputs any informational alerts. These are the same as the errors, but might have different CSS.
* `alert`
** This macro is used by the `printErrorAlerts` and `printInfoAlerts` but you can also use it directly to display an error or info message anywhere on the page.

=== Form Helpers

The `_helpers.ftl` template also provides a couple of macros that help render form elements and output form errors. Here are the macros you can use:

* `hidden`
** This outputs a hidden input element. Many pieces of the OAuth workflow and the other pages in FusionAuth use hidden form fields to store data. This macro uses the `eval` feature of FreeMarker in order to pull in data that was in the request. You shouldn't edit this macro unless you know what you are doing.
* `input`
** This outputs an input element plus a label and any errors that might have occurred on the form field. You can use this for text, passwords, and other input elements. FusionAuth also leverages `addons` which are icons next to the input field that provide visual cues to the user. This macro allows you to leverage addons as well. Similar to the `hidden` element, you should not edit this unless you know what you are doing.
* `errors`
** This macro is used by the `input` macro to render errors on the field. You can use this if you write your own `input` macros. Otherwise, you likely won't use this.
* `button`
** This macro renders a button that can be used to submit a form. The FusionAuth version of this macro includes an icon and the button text.

== Preview a Theme

=== Previewing a theme

If you want to see how your theme works, you can always open a browser with no active FusionAuth session and visit the hosted login pages.

However, at times, you may need to make changes in your theme that you want to view without going through an entire registration process. You can easily do so by previewing the theme via the administrative user interface.

Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Customizations -> Themes#. Choose your theme, then click the preview link (the green magnifying glass):

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/theming-advanced-forms/preview-theme-button.png" alt="Preview your theme." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

This will open a new tab. Click on any of the pages you've modifed in the left hand navigation, for example [field]#OAuth register#, and you'll see the page as it would be rendered. 

== Example Code

=== Example of Customizing the Authorize Page

Now that you have a good overview of all the templates, macros and helpers, here is an example of customizing the Authorize page.

Let's assume you want to change the header and footer across all of the pages including the Authorize page. This is accomplished by editing the `helpers.header` and `helpers.footer` macros. For the header, let's assume you want to add a `Sign Up` and `Login` link. For the footer, let's assume you want to add a link to your privacy policy. Here are the macros that include these new links:

[source,html]
.Custom header helper
----
[#macro header]
  <header class="my-custom-header">
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li class="login"><a target="_blank" href="https://my-application.com/login">Login</li>
        <li class="sign-up"><a target="_blank" href="https://my-application.com/sign-up">Sign Up</li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>

  [#nested/]
[/#macro]
----

[source,html]
.Custom footer helper
----
[#macro footer]
  <footer class="my-custom-footer">
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li class="privacy-policy"><a target="_blank" href="https://my-application.com/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </footer>

  [#nested/]
[/#macro]
----

Once you make these changes, they will take effect on all of the pages listed above.

== Template Variables

Each template has different variables that are available to it. These variables can be used in the template to help with rendering the HTML. There are also a couple of common variables that are available in all of the pages. The common variables and the page specific variables are all listed below:

By default FusionAuth will provide HTML escaping on all values rendered in HTML, this protects you from script injection attacks. If you find a value that is being incorrectly escaped you may need to utilize the FreeMarker built in for no-escape `?no_esc`.

=== Common Variables

The verification id that was included on as a URL parameter but was invalid. This page does a redirect if the verificationId is valid.


=== OAuth Authorize

[.endpoint]
--
[uri]#/oauth2/authorize#
--

==== Variables

[.api]
[field]#client_id# [type]#[String]#::
The OAuth v2.0 `client_id` parameter. This is synonymous with FusionAuth's Application Id.

[field]#hasDomainBasedIdentityProviders# [type]#[Boolean]#::
A boolean that indicates if there are domain-based identity providers configured. These identity providers use the user's email address to determine if an external IdP should be used to log the user in.

[field]#identityProviders# [type]#[Map<String, List<Object>>]#::
A map of the configured identity providers for the Application the user is logging into. The key into the map is the type of the identity provider (i.e. `Facebook` or `OpenIDConnect`). The value is a list of all of the configured identity providers for that type.
+
**NOTE:** This map does not contain any "domain-based" identity providers since those are handled differently using just the Email input field to start and then possibly redirecting the browser to the external IdP login page.

[field]#loginId# [type]#[String]#::
The value from the `loginId` form field. This is either the username or the email of the user attempting to log into FusionAuth.

If there are domain based identity providers and the user types in an email address that is not managed by the identity provider, FusionAuth will then re-render this template with this variable set to `true`. This will indicate that the password field should be shown so that the user can complete their login. If you need an example of this behavior, check out the login page at https://www.pivotaltracker.com/signin.

[field]#state# [type]#[String]#::
The OAuth v2.0 `state` parameter.

== Handling Failures

If you happen to get into a situation where you have edited a template and it is causing errors that are preventing you from logging in, you can override the use of the UI templates to render a login form that lets you log in. To do this, open your browser and access your FusionAuth admin UI. This will redirect you to the broken `/oauth2/authorize` page. Click in your browsers address bar and scroll to the end. Finally, add the String `&bypassTheme=true` to the end of the URL and hit the Enter key. This should render the default login page that ships with FusionAuth and allow you to log in and fix any errors you have.
