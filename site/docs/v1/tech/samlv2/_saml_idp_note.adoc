This document covers the configuration for FusionAuth's SAML v2 identity provider. If you are looking for instructions to setup FusionAuth as a SAML v2 service provider (i.e. you want to allow users to log into either FusionAuth's UI or your applications via a third party SAML v2 identity provider), consult the documentation under link:/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers/samlv2/[SAML v2 Identity Provider].
