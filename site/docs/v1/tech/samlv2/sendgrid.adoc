== Overview

SendGrid is a transactional email service. Using a SAML v2 identity provider, you can control who has access to your SendGrid account. This document covers the configuration necessary to get SendGrid working with FusionAuth as the identity provider using SAML v2. 

include::docs/v1/tech/samlv2/_saml_idp_note.adoc[]

[NOTE.note]
====
This document helps you set up single sign-on using SAML for your SendGrid account. If you are looking to set up SendGrid as an email provider, you want link:/docs/v1/tech/email-templates/configure-email#sendgrid[this documentation instead].
====

== Prerequisites

This document assumes you have a running instance of FusionAuth and a working SendGrid application. You will also need an admin account for FusionAuth and be the account owner in SendGrid to configure them correctly.

[NOTE.note]
====
Single Sign-On (SSO) is available for Twilio SendGrid Email API Pro, Premier, and Marketing Campaigns Advanced plans only. See the https://sendgrid.com/pricing/[Twilio SendGrid pricing page] for a full list of Twilio SendGrid features available by plan.

== Configure SendGrid

In your https://app.sendgrid.com/[SendGrid dashboard], navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> SSO Settings# and click [uielement]#Add Configuration#.

Name it `FusionAuth` and write down both [field]#Single Sign-On URL# and [field]#Audience URL (SP Entity ID)# fields as you'll use them soon. Click [uielement]#Next#.

== Configure FusionAuth

Before finishing configuring SendGrid, you have to configure the certificate issuer and create an application in FusionAuth.

Log in to your instance, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Tenants# and click icon:edit[role=ui-button blue,type=fas] on your tenant to edit it. Change the [field]#Issuer# to your FusionAuth instance domain without the protocol (e.g. `your.application.com`) and click on icon:save[role=ui-button blue,type=fas] to save your tenant.

Now, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Applications#, click icon:plus[role=ui-button green,type=fas] and name it `SendGrid`.

Go to the [breadcrumb]#SAML# tab and toggle the [field]#Enabled# switch. Paste the [field]#Audience URL (SP Entity ID)# and [field]#Single Sign-On URL# you copied from SendGrid to [field]#Issuer# and [field]#Authorized redirect URLs# fields in your FusionAuth application, respectively.

.Mapping fields
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|SendGrid|FusionAuth

|[field]#Audience URL (SP Entity ID)#
|[field]#Issuer#

|[field]#Single Sign-On URL#
|[field]#Authorized redirect URLs#
|===

Scroll down to [uielement]#Authentication response# and change [field]#Signature canonicalization method# to `Exclusive`.

Click icon:save[role=ui-button blue,type=fas] to save your application. When redirected to the [breadcrumb]#Applications# page, view your application details by clicking icon:search[role=ui-button green,type=fas].

image::samlv2/sendgrid/saml-integration-details.png[Getting the SAML integration details.,width=1200]

In [uielement]#SAML v2 Integration details#, write down both [field]#Entity Id# and [field]#Login URL# fields.

Copy the [field]#Metadata URL# and open it in a new browser tab. This will contain configuration you'll need shortly.

[NOTE.note]
====
This URL contains an XML file. If your browser doesnâ€™t automatically format it, you can copy everything and use https://xmlviewer.org/[an online XML beautifier].
====

Copy the contents of the `X509Certificate` element from the XML file and write it down.

== Finish setting up SendGrid

Retrieve the first two values you copied from your FusionAuth application and write the [field]#Entity Id# to SendGrid's [field]#SAML Issuer ID# and the [field]#Login URL# in [field]#Embed Link#.

image::samlv2/sendgrid/sendgrid-add-configuration-after-initial.png[Filling SSO configuration in SendGrid.,width=1200]

In the [uielement]#Certificates# session, click [uielement]#Add Certificate#.

In the modal, paste your FusionAuth application's certificate into [field]#X509 Certificate# and enclose it between `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`, as seen in the example below.

[source,crt]
....
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<contents of X509Certificate copied from FusionAuth>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
....

Here's a walkthrough of these steps.

Click [uielement]#Add Certificate# to save the certificate.

Finally click [uielement]#Enable SSO# to finish the configuration.

== User Management

Go to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Teammates#, click the [uielement]#Add Teammate# dropdown button in the top right corner of the page and select [uielement]#Add SSO teammate#.

Fill in the same email address from a FusionAuth user and their first and last names. Click [uielement]#Next#. Choose one of the available permissions (e.g. `Add with read-only access`) and click [uielement]#Save# to add the user.

== Testing

Browse to the https://app.sendgrid.com/[Sendgrid login page] in another browser or in an incognito tab and click `Log in with single sign-on (SSO) instead`.

image::samlv2/sendgrid/login-page.png[SendGrid login page with SSO option.,width=1200]

In the dedicated SSO page, you need to fill in the username you created earlier and click [uielement]#Log In with SSO#.
