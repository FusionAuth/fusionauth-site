== Overview

include::docs/v1/tech/samlv2/_saml_idp_note.adoc[]
[NOTE.note]
====
This document helps you set up single sign-on using SAML for your SendGrid account. If you are looking to set up SendGrid as an email provider, you want link:/docs/v1/tech/email-templates/configure-email#sendgrid[this documentation instead].
====

== Prerequisites

This document assumes you have a running instance of FusionAuth and a working SendGrid application. You will also need an admin account for FusionAuth and be the account owner in SendGrid to configure them correctly.

[NOTE.note]
====
Single Sign-On (SSO) is available for Twilio SendGrid Email API Pro, Premier, and Marketing Campaigns Advanced plans only. See the https://sendgrid.com/pricing/[Twilio SendGrid pricing page] for a full list of Twilio SendGrid features available by plan.
====

== Configure SendGrid

In your https://app.sendgrid.com/[SendGrid dashboard], navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> SSO Settings# and click [uielement]#Add Configuration#.

Name it `FusionAuth` and write down both [field]#Single Sign-On URL# and [field]#Audience URL (SP Entity ID)# fields as you'll use them soon. Click [uielement]#Next#.

== Configure FusionAuth

Before finishing configuring SendGrid, you have to configure the certificate issuer and create an application in FusionAuth.

Log in to your instance, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Tenants# and click icon:edit[role=ui-button blue,type=fas] on your tenant to edit it. Change the [field]#Issuer# to your FusionAuth instance domain without the protocol (e.g. `your.application.com`) and click on icon:save[role=ui-button blue,type=fas] to save your tenant.

Now, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Applications#, click icon:plus[role=ui-button green,type=fas] and name it `SendGrid`.

Go to the [breadcrumb]#SAML# tab and toggle the [field]#Enabled# switch. Paste the [field]#Audience URL (SP Entity ID)# and [field]#Single Sign-On URL# you copied from SendGrid to [field]#Issuer# and [field]#Authorized redirect URLs# fields in your FusionAuth application, respectively.

.Mapping fields
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|SendGrid|FusionAuth

|[field]#Audience URL (SP Entity ID)#
|[field]#Issuer#

|[field]#Single Sign-On URL#
|[field]#Authorized redirect URLs#
|===

Scroll down to [uielement]#Authentication response# and change [field]#Signature canonicalization method# to `Exclusive`.

Click icon:save[role=ui-button blue,type=fas] to save your application. When redirected to the [breadcrumb]#Applications# page, view your application details by clicking icon:search[role=ui-button green,type=fas].

image::samlv2/sendgrid/saml-integration-details.png[Getting the SAML integration details.,width=1200]

In [uielement]#SAML v2 Integration details#, write down both [field]#Entity Id# and [field]#Login URL# fields.

Copy the [field]#Metadata URL# and open it in a new browser tab. This will contain configuration you'll need shortly.

[NOTE.note]
====
This URL contains an XML file. If your browser doesn’t automatically format it, you can copy everything and use https://xmlviewer.org/[an online XML beautifier].
====

Copy the contents of the `X509Certificate` element from the XML file and write it down.

== Finish setting up SendGrid

Retrieve the first two values you copied from your FusionAuth application and write the [field]#Entity Id# to SendGrid's [field]#SAML Issuer ID# and the [field]#Login URL# in [field]#Embed Link#.

image::samlv2/sendgrid/sendgrid-add-configuration-after-initial.png[Filling SSO configuration in SendGrid.,width=1200]

In the [uielement]#Certificates# session, click [uielement]#Add Certificate#.

In the modal, paste your FusionAuth application's certificate into [field]#X509 Certificate# and enclose it between `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`, as seen in the example below.

[source,crt]
....
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<contents of X509Certificate copied from FusionAuth>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
....

Here's a walkthrough of these steps.

Click [uielement]#Add Certificate# to save the certificate.

Finally click [uielement]#Enable SSO# to finish the configuration.

== User Management

Go to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Teammates#, click the [uielement]#Add Teammate# dropdown button in the top right corner of the page and select [uielement]#Add SSO teammate#.

Fill in the same email address from a FusionAuth user and their first and last names. Click [uielement]#Next#. Choose one of the available permissions (e.g. `Add with read-only access`) and click [uielement]#Save# to add the user.

== Testing

Browse to the https://app.sendgrid.com/[Sendgrid login page] in another browser or in an incognito tab and click `Log in with single sign-on (SSO) instead`.

In the dedicated SSO page, you need to fill in the username you created earlier and click [uielement]#Log In with SSO#.
