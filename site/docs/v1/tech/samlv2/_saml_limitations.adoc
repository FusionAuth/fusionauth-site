FusionAuth supports SAML both as an Identity Provider (IdP) and as a Service Provider (SP). 

The IdP implementation has certain limitations. Version `2.0` is supported; other SAML versions are unsupported.

FusionAuth supports two `NameIDPolicy` values:

* `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress`
* `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified`

Please examine the `NameIDPolicy` of the software package for which you are configuring FusionAuth as the IdP to determine if these `NameIDPolicy` values are supported. 

FusionAuth supports the following SAMLv2 bindings:

* HTTP Redirect 
* HTTP POST

Other bindings are not supported.
