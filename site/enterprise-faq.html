        <h1>Still not convinced? Questions we get asked:</h1>
        <h3>Why don't you have a sales team?</h3>
        <p>
          We got tired of dealing with procurement managers who want to endlessly negotiate pricing and legal terms for no reason until one or both parties ultimately die of exhaustion or boredom. We are a bunch of engineers, and we like the idea of great software selling itself instead of a sales team trying to convince you. We prefer to spend our time making great software. It may sound counterintuitive to allocate resources to improve the product we're selling, rather than to spend time making PDFs selling it, but we've had reasonable success with this strategy.
        </p>
        <h3>So how am I supposed to buy your software for my company?</h3>
        <p>
          Go ahead and <a href='/pricing'>download the community edition</a> and check out how awesome FusionAuth is. Then <a href='/pricing'>buy a plan</a> that suits your needs. Trust us, buying software can be simple. We work with many large organizations. If they can figure it out, your company probably can too.
        </p>
        <h3>What about compliance, security and special requirements?</h3>
        <p>
          We can accommodate most any requirements, and are happy to match your needs with a custom edition. Let us know what you need; we'll let you know what the extra cost will be.
        </p>
        <h3>What is this? I don't get this outrageous, unorthodox sales strategy?</h3>
        <p>
          We make software. Awesome software that lets your team work on their awesome software. If you would like to buy FusionAuth, we are happy to accept your money in return for our hosting, support, and software. If you find another solution, well, we'll still be here if you end up changing your mind.
        </p>
        <h3>Can we just schedule a quick call?</h3>
        <p>
          If we can't easily answer your question by <a href='/contact'>email</a>, we'd be happy to set up a call.
