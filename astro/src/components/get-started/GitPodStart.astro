<a href="https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-example-express-start-here" target="_blank" alt="Open in GitPod"><img src="https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg" /></a>

<p>The GitPod environment will spin up Docker containers with a FusionAuth instance, any dependencies, a terminal and an editor.</p>

<Aside>When you first copy and paste something in the GitPod environment, you may be presented with a popup asking for permission. Look out for that, and accept it to be able to paste commands into the environment.</Aside>

<p>Here you are using a bootstrapping feature of FusionAuth called <a href="/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/kickstart">Kickstart</a>. When FusionAuth comes up for the first time, it will look at the <code>kickstart/kickstart.json</code> file and configure FusionAuth to your specified state.</p>

<p>After the servers start up (which takes a few minutes), you will be presented with a login screen in the GitPod 'Simple Browser', as well other parts of the GitPod environment.</p>

<p>FusionAuth will be initially configured with these settings:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your example username is <code><RemoteValue url={kickstartUri} selector="$.variables.userEmail" /></code> and the password is <code><RemoteValue url={kickstartUri} selector="$.variables.userPassword" /></code>.</li>
    <li>Your admin username is <code><RemoteValue url={kickstartUri} selector="$.variables.adminEmail" /></code> and the password is <code><RemoteValue url={kickstartUri} selector="$.variables.adminPassword" /></code>.</li>
    <li>The base URL of FusionAuth is based on your GitPod environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can log in to the FusionAuth admin UI using the below command and look around if you want to, but with Docker and Kickstart, everything will already be configured correctly.</p>

<Code code="gp preview `gp url 9011`/admin" />

<h2> Summing Up</h2>

<p>To verify that your system is set up, log in using the admin credentials above. You will see the FusionAuth admin UI.</p>

<p>You're done with step 1... congratulations! You've got your own FusionAuth instance running in the GitPod cloud.</p>
