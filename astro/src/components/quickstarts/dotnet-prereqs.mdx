- [Docker](https://www.docker.com): The quickest way to stand up FusionAuth. (There are [other ways](/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/)).

This app has been tested with .NET 7. This example should work with other compatible versions of .NET.

Optionally, you can also install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) to make it easier to work with .NET through an IDE.
