Your FusionAuth instance is now running on a different machine (your computer) than the mobile app will run (either a real device or an emulator), which means that it won't be able to access `localhost`.

If the device and your computer are not connected to the same network or if you have something that blocks connections (like a firewall), learn [how to expose a local FusionAuth instance to the internet](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/exposing-instance).
In summary, the process entails configuring [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) on your local system, [starting your FusionAuth instance on port 9011](#run-fusionauth-via-docker), and subsequently executing the following command.

```shell
ngrok http --request-header-add 'X-Forwarded-Port:443' 9011
```

This will generate a public URL that you can use to access FusionAuth when developing the app.

If the device (either real or emulator) and your computer are connected to the same network, you can use the local IP Address for your machine (for example, `192.168.15.2`). Here are a few articles to help you find your IP address, depending on the operating system you are running:
