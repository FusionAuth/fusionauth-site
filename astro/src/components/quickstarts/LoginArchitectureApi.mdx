A client wants access to an API resource at `/resource`. However, it is denied this resource until it acquires an access token from FusionAuth.

```mermaid title="Resource Server Authentication with FusionAuth"
    sequenceDiagram
        participant Client
        participant App as Resource Server
        participant FusionAuth

        Client ->> App : GET /resource
        App ->> Client : 401 Not Authorized
        Client ->> FusionAuth : POST /api/login
        FusionAuth ->> Client : 200 Ok<br/>(token)
        Client ->> App : GET /resource
        App ->> Client : 200 Ok<br/>(resource) 
```

While the access token is acquired via the Login API above, this is for simplicity of illustration.
The token can be, and typically is, acquired through one of the [OAuth grants](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/).
