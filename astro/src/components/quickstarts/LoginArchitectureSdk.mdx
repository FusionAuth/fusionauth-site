While this sample application doesn't have login functionality without FusionAuth, a more typical integration will replace an existing login system with FusionAuth.
In that case, the system might look like this before FusionAuth is introduced.

```mermaid title="Request flow during login before FusionAuth"
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant App as Application

    User ->> App : View Homepage
    User ->> App : Click Login Link
    App ->> User : Show Login Form
    User ->> App : Fill Out and Submit Login Form
    App ->> App : Authenticates User
    App ->> User : Display User's Account or Other Info
```

And here's the same application login flow after introducing FusionAuth.

```mermaid title="Request flow during login after FusionAuth"
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant App as Application
    participant FusionAuth

    User ->> App : View Homepage
    User ->> App : Click Login Link (to FusionAuth)
    User ->> FusionAuth : View Login Form
    FusionAuth ->> User : Show Login Form
    User ->> FusionAuth : Fill Out and Submit Login Form
    FusionAuth ->> FusionAuth : Authenticates User
    FusionAuth ->> User: Go to Redirect URI
    User ->> App: Request the Redirect URI
    App ->> FusionAuth : Is User Authenticated?
    FusionAuth ->> App : User is Authenticated
    App ->> User : Display User's Account or Other Info
```

In general, you are introducing FusionAuth in order to normalize and consolidate user data. This helps make sure it is consistent and up-to-date as well as offloading your login security and functionality to FusionAuth.
