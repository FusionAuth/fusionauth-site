- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/): Java can be installed via a variety of methods. This app was built using Java 17. You can change which version to use by editing the project's `pom.xml` file. The code in this example should be compatible down to Java 8, though minor differences may occur.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com): The quickest way to stand up FusionAuth. Ensure you also have [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.
- (Alternatively, you can [Install FusionAuth Manually](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/)).

The example repository already has a Spring Boot application set up that includes a Maven wrapper. You can find out more by viewing:

- [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/): The Spring Boot template generator webpage.
- [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/): A self-contained version of the Maven build tool which will download the application dependencies and compile the source code.
