// Creates an issue entry in a release notes section, including the "Learn more at GitHub issue #nnnn" bit
//
// issue: a single GitHub issue number referencing an issue in the fusionauth-issues repo.
//
// Note that in our release notes docs, these are added to top-level markdown bullets. If you want to include multi-line text in the body, be sure to indent it so the renderer knows it's supposed to go with the bullet (you'll get an error if you don't).
//
// Example:
// * <ReleaseNotesKnownIssue issue="1234">
//   Some content
//
//   Some other content
//   </ReleaseNotesKnownIssue>

export interface Props {
  issue: string;
}

const { issue } = Astro.props as Props;
