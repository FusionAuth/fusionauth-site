[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs) is an open-source framework (suite of apps) and a protocol for collecting information about a running application.

You can either use an OpenTelemetry library as a module in your code, which you call manually to send it application-specific metrics (instrumentation), or you can use a stock OpenTelemetry instrumentation agent, like the Java Virtual Machine agent, that collects general information about your application as it runs.

You could also collect metrics about your application through another tool and send them to an OpenTelemetry Collector service through OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol), a standardized way of exchanging telemetry data between tools. The collector acts as a central point to receive all metrics, potentially do some simple filtering, and forward the metrics to other services.

OpenTelemetry does not handle storage, data aggregation (counting things), or visualization (dashboards).

For example, you could run the OpenTelemetry Java agent before running your app. The agent would monitor the RAM use of your app as a metric and send it to an OpenTelemetry Collector, which would forward the metric to another service for saving, counting, and displaying in a dashboard.
