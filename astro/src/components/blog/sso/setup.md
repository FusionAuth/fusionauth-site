To set up the application, navigate to the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin) and select "Applications" on the left-hand navigation bar:

![Set up the application.](/img/blogs/includes/fusionauth/set-up-the-application.png)

Then click on the "+" button on the top right of the "Applications" page and fill in the "Name" field with a name of your choosing (here, it's **"your_application"**):

![Name your application.](/img/blogs/includes/fusionauth/name-the-application.png)

You can leave all the other fields empty because FusionAuth will choose a default value for those fields. Go ahead and save the application in order for the Client Id details to be generated.

Access the "Application" page again and click on the "Edit Applications" icon (a little edit/notepad icon):

![The list of applications. The edit icon is the blue pencil/notepad.](/img/blogs/includes/fusionauth/edit-application.png)

On the "Edit Application" page, click on the "OAuth" tab at the top. You'll need to get some information from this page.
