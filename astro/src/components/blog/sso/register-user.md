import Breadcrumb from 'src/components/Breadcrumb.astro';

Next, register the user for the application. Navigate to the <Breadcrumb>Users</Breadcrumb> tab and find your user. Click on the black "Manage
User" button under the "Action" heading in the list. You'll end up at the details page:

![The user details screen, where you can register them.](/img/blogs/includes/fusionauth/register-user.png)

Click "Add registration" to register the user in `your_application`.

![Adding the user registration.](/img/blogs/includes/fusionauth/add-registration.png)

If users of this application have unique configuration details, such as a username, timezone, or languages, which are
different from the user's defaults, you could configure them here.

However, for this tutorial, you can click the blue "Save" button and accept the default values.
