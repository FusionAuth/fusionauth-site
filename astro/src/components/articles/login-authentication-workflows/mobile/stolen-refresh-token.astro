<li>This is an attack vector where the attacker has stolen the user's refresh token. Here, the attacker requests the user's shopping cart with the stolen refresh token and an invalid JWT</li>
<li>The application backend verifies the JWT and realizes it is invalid. Since the attacker also sent across the refresh token, the application backend calls the JWT refresh API in FusionAuth with the refresh token</li>
<li>FusionAuth looks up the refresh token and returns a new JWT</li>
<li>The application backend uses the JWT to look up the user's shopping cart. It responds to the attacker with the user's shopping cart. It also includes the new JWT that attacker can now use</li>
