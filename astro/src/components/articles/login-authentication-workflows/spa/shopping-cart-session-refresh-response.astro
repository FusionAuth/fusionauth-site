<li>The application backend might return the User object to the browser if it needs it. The id for the server-side session is written back to the browser in an HTTP cookie. The refresh token from FusionAuth is also written back to the browser in an HTTP cookie. These cookies are HttpOnly, which prevents JavaScript from accessing them, making them less vulnerable to theft. Additionally, all requests from the browser to the application backend will include these cookies so that the backend can retrieve the User object from the server-side session and refresh their session if it expires </li>
