<li>A while later, the user's refresh token expires and the user clicks on their shopping cart again. The browser requests the shopping cart from the application backend via AJAX and sends the JWT and refresh token to the application backend</li>
<li>The application backend verifies the JWT and realizes it is expired. Since the browser also sent across the refresh token, the application backend calls the JWT refresh API in FusionAuth with the refresh token</li>
<li>Since the refresh token has expired, FusionAuth returns a 404 status code</li>
<li>Since FusionAuth returned a 404 status code, the application backend returns a 401 that indicates the user is no longer logged in</li>
<li>At this point, the application can allow the user to log in the same way they did above</li>
