<li>{prefix} The application might automatically redirect the browser back to FusionAuth's OAuth 2 interface or wait until the user clicks the login link. Regardless, the browser requests the OAuth 2 login page from FusionAuth with a <code>response_type</code> of <code>token</code> indicating that it is using the implicit grant</li>
<li>FusionAuth realizes that the user already has a session and is already logged in. Therefore, it returns a redirect to the application backend's OAuth 2 <code>redirect_uri</code>. This redirect includes a new JWT from FusionAuth in the URI</li>
<li>The browser requests the application backend's OAuth <code>redirect_uri</code>. This request does not include the JWT because it is after the <code>#</code> in the URL, which means the browser will not send it in the HTTP request to the application backend </li>
<li>The application backend responds with the HTML, CSS & JavaScript of the application. During this step, the browser will initialize the single-page application. As part of the initialization of the application, the JWT  will be pulled from the current URL of the browser </li>
