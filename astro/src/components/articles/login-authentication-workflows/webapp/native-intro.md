This workflow is used by web applications using a native login form inside a webapp. This login form <code>POST</code>s the user's credentials (email and password) to the backend of the application. The application backend in turn calls to FusionAuth. Below is a diagram that describes the primary components of this workflow and how they interact. Keep in mind that not every interaction is covered here, just the primary login interactions. At the bottom of the diagram is a discussion of the key steps.

For all of our examples, we use a store and a forum for the same company. The store requires a user to log in to view their shopping cart and the forum requires the user to log in to view forum posts. We also provide a couple of example attack vectors that hackers could use if portions of the system are compromised. These cases might be theoretical or based on known exploits such as XSS (cross-site scripting).
