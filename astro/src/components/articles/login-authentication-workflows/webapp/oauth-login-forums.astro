<li>The browser requests the forum webapp's homepage from the application backend. This is a standard SSO login that is fully supported by FusionAuth</li>
<li>The application backend responds with the HTML, CSS & JavaScript of the homepage</li>
<li>The user clicks the login link and the browser navigates away from the webapp to FusionAuth's OAuth 2 interface. The browser requests the OAuth 2 login page from FusionAuth with a <code>response_type</code> of code indicating that it is using the authorization code grant. Additionally, the session cookie that was set during the first login is also sent by the browser to FusionAuth</li>
<li>FusionAuth realizes that the user already has a session and is already logged in. Therefore, it returns a redirect to the application backend's OAuth 2 <code>redirect_uri</code>. This redirect includes the authorization code from FusionAuth</li>
<li>The browser requests the application backend's OAuth <code>redirect_uri</code> with the authorization code from FusionAuth</li>
<li>The application backend calls FusionAuth's OAuth 2 token endpoint with the authorization code and optionally the <code>client_secret</code></li>
<li>FusionAuth verifies the authorization code and <code>client_secret</code>. It returns a 200 along with a JWT and refresh token in JSON. **NOTE**: all of this happens without any user interaction, hence the SSO nature of this login</li>
