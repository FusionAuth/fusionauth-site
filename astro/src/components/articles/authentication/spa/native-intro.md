This workflow example is used by single-page applications using a native login form inside the webapp. This login form uses an AJAX <code>POST</code> to send the user's credentials (email and password) to the backend of the application. The application backend then in turn calls to FusionAuth. Below is a backend-code login-page diagram that describes the primary components of this workflow and how they interact. Keep in mind that not every interaction is covered here, just the primary login interactions. At the bottom of the diagram is a discussion of the key steps.

For all of our examples, we use a store and a forum for the same company. The store requires a user to login to view their shopping cart and the forum requires the user to login to view forum posts. We also provide a couple of example attack vectors that hackers could use if portions of the system are compromised. These cases might be theoretical or based on known exploits such as XSS (cross-site scripting).
