<li>A while later, the user's server-side session and refresh token both expire and the user clicks on their shopping cart again. The browser requests the shopping cart from the application backend via AJAX and sends the session and refresh token cookies to the application backend</li>
<li>The application backend attempts to load the server-side session associated with session cookie and realizes it is expired. Since the browser also sent across the refresh token, the application backend calls the JWT refresh API in FusionAuth with the refresh token</li>
<li>Since the refresh token has expired, FusionAuth returns a 404 status code</li>
<li>Since FusionAuth returned a 404 status code, the application backend returns a 401 indicating that the user is no longer logged in</li>
<li>At this point, the application can allow the user to log in the same way they did above</li>
