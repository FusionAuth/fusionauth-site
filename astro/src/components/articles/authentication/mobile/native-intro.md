This workflow is used by mobile applications using a native login form inside the app. This login form `POST`s the user's credentials (email and password) to either the backend of the application or directly to FusionAuth. If the credentials are `POST`ed to the backend of the application, this must in turn send the credentials to FusionAuth. Below is a diagram that describes the primary components of this workflow and how they interact. Keep in mind that not every interaction is covered here, just the primary login interactions. At the bottom of the diagram is a discussion of the key steps.

For the mobile application examples, we only use a store app and do not provide an SSO workflow. The store requires a user to login to view their shopping cart. We also provide a couple of example attack vectors that hackers could use if portions of the system are compromised. These cases might be theoretical or based on known exploits such hacked devices.
