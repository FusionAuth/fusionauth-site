Each party acknowledges that the Confidential Information (as hereinafter defined) of the other party may contain information valuable to the Disclosing Party, and each party that receives such Confidential Information (the "Receiving Party") from the other party (the "Disclosing Party") agrees that Confidential Information will remain the property of the Disclosing Party.

Receiving Party will not disclose Disclosing Party's Confidential Information to any third party, except to such Receiving Party's employees and contractors who need to know such information in order for such party to perform under this Agreement and who are bound by confidentiality and non-use obligations not less restrictive than this Agreement. "Confidential Information" means all information that is, or should be reasonably understood to be, confidential or proprietary information of the Disclosing Party (and its suppliers, contractors and customers), including without limitation information concerning its business, products, services, finances, employees, contractors, software, notes, documentation, tools, processes, protocols, product designs and plans, customer lists and other marketing and technical information, whether disclosed orally or in writing by any other media.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party will not be in violation of this Section with regard to disclosure of Confidential Information in response to an order or subpoena of a court, agency or tribunal of competent jurisdiction, or pursuant to any applicable law or regulation, provided that the Receiving Party provides the Disclosing Party with prior written notice of such disclosure to the extent reasonably practicable and legally permissible in order to permit the Disclosing Party to seek confidential treatment of such information. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, each party shall return to the other party all Confidential Information of the other party, and all copies thereof, in the possession, custody or control of the party unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement.

## Exhibit A
### Support Services

This Support Services exhibit ("Support Exhibit") by and between Company and Licensee is hereby incorporated into the Licensee License Agreement (the "Agreement").  All terms not otherwise defined in this Support Exhibit have the meanings provided in the Agreement. The terms and conditions in this Support Exhibit only apply if Licensee has purchased Support Services as reflected in an applicable Order Form.

1. Support Services.  Support Services consist of (a) Error Corrections and Technical Support regarding the installation and use of the Software, and (b) periodic delivery of Updates when Company makes such Updates commercially available to its customers. Telephone, e-mail, verbal and Internet-based support shall only be available during Company's regular business hours in Colorado (9a.m.- 5p.m. MST) unless otherwise specified in an applicable Order Form.  Such support will be given (i) to answer routine questions regarding the use of the Software; (ii) to assist Licensee in identifying and reporting Errors which may need corrections; (iii) to assist Licensee in identifying and reporting new features and functional improvements that may warrant the development of an Update or Enhancement; and (iv) to provide work-around solutions when reasonably available.  Support Services cover only, and Licensee is responsible for obtaining at its expense, Operating Environments designated by Company in the Documentation. If additional implementation services are required due to any incompatibility between Licensee's Operating Environment and the Software and if Licensee requests Company to perform other services and Company agrees to provide such additional services ("Additional Services"), these shall be provided by Company under Exhibit B (Professional Services).  At Licensee's request, Company will provide a written quote for rates or fees for specific Additional Services. Company will not be responsible for providing Support Services for any version of the Software other than the then-most recent release of the Software, except that Company will provide Licensee with Support Services for a reasonable period of time to allow Licensee to implement the most recent Update, not to exceed six (6) months. Licensee agrees to maintain the Software to the latest version as soon as practicable and to incorporate all corrections and enhancements to the Software provided by Company.  Licensee understands that its failure to incorporate error corrections and enhancements will cause the Software to be non-conforming and that subsequent Software error corrections, enhancements and updates may be unusable.
1. Duration.  This Support Exhibit will terminate upon the expiration or termination of the Agreement for any reason.  Company may terminate this Support Exhibit or suspend Support Services if Licensee fails to make payment as provided under the Agreement or breaches this Support Exhibit and such breach is not remedied within fifteen (15) days after Licensee receives notice of the breach.
1. Fees and Payment.  Licensee agrees to pay the Fees and other charges as specified in the Order Form for the Support Services. Termination of this Support Exhibit will not relieve Licensee of its obligations to pay all Fees, other charges and expenses that accrued prior to such termination.
1. Error Priority Levels.
   1. Company shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to correct any sufficiently identified Error reported in writing by Licensee in accordance with the priority level reasonably assigned to such Error by Company.

        (a) In the event of (i) a crash of Licensee's computer network causing a critical impact to business operations that Licensee reasonably believes is due to an Error in the Software or (ii) Priority A Errors, Company will promptly commence verification of the Error and, upon verification, will initiate work to provide Licensee with an Error Correction. If Licensee has purchased Enterprise Support, Company will make the initial verification of the Error and report its findings back to Licensee within 1 hour of the report of the Error by Licensee. Company will provide Licensee with reports on the status of the Error Correction every 2 hours. If commercially feasible, Error Correction will be delivered within 24 hours of the report of the Error by Licensee.  If Licensee has purchased Basic Support, Company will provide Licensee with periodic reports on the status of the Error Correction. If commercially feasible, Error Correction will be delivered within 72 hours of the report of the Error by Licensee.

        (b) In the event of Priority B Errors, Company will commence verification during normal support hours of the Error, and upon verification, initiate work to provide Licensee with Error Correction. If Licensee has purchased Enterprise Support, Company will make the initial verification of the Error and report its findings back to Licensee within 6 hours of the report of the Error by Licensee. If commercially feasible, Error Correction will be delivered within 1 week of the report of the Error by Licensee. If Licensee has purchased Basic Support, Company will provide Error Correction in the next Update of the Software.

        (c) In the event of Priority C Errors, Company may include the Error Correction for the Error in the next Update of the Software.

   1. If Company believes that a problem reported by Licensee may not be due to an Error in the Software, Company will so notify Licensee. At that time, Licensee may (a) instruct Company to proceed with problem determination at Licensee's possible expense as set forth below or (b) instruct Company that Licensee does not wish Company to pursue the problem.  If Licensee requests that Company proceed with problem determination at Licensee's possible expense and Company determines that the error was not due to an Error in the Software, Licensee shall pay Company, at Company's then-current and standard consulting rates, for all work performed in connection with such determination, plus reasonable related expenses incurred by Company.  If Licensee instructs Company that it does not wish the problem pursued at its possible expense or if such determination requires efforts in excess of Licensee's instructions, Company may, at its sole discretion, elect not to investigate the problem with no liability therefore.
