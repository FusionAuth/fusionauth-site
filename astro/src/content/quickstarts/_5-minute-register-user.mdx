Next, grant the user you created in the Setup Wizard permissions to log into your new Application. This can be done from the User management section of the FusionAuth admin UI. Click the <strong>Users</strong> link in the navigation. If needed, search for the user.

Manage the user's details by clicking on the black "Manage" button.

Once you are in this user's account, you'll click the "Add Registration" button. This will take us to a page that will allow us to add a registration for this user to the new Application. Registrations associate users with applications. You may have to select an Application if there are multiple options.

For this tutorial, you don't need to provide any additional information for the registration; click the save button at the top.

Now the user has permissions to log into your application.

<Aside type="note">
Adding a registration to a user is not always required to let your users log in to your application.

FusionAuth supports self-service registration. With self-service registration enabled, a registration will be added when a user signs up. Learn more about [self-service registration](/docs/lifecycle/register-users/basic-registration-forms).

You want to make sure your user account has a first name, which should appear under the picture.

If they don't, use the <strong>Edit Profile</strong> button in the upper right hand corner of the user details screen to edit the account account and give them one. The first name is how they'll be greeted in the application.
