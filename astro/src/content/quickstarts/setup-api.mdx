Welcome! At the end of this guide, you will know how to add login (sign in) and logout (sign out) to a Node.js application, using httpie to access the fusionauth server.

If you haven't already done so, launch FusionAuth from one of the step 1 guides:

<BlogButton label="GitPod" href="/docs/quickstarts/launch-cloud" /><span class="mr-3" />
<BlogButton label="Docker" href="/docs/quickstarts/launch-docker" /><span class="mr-3" />
<BlogButton label="Local" href="/docs/quickstarts/launch-local" /><span class="mr-3" />

## Requirements

You will need to be in the repository you cloned for step 1 above.

Since this guide works by interacting with the API, you will need *httpie*, a command line tool for interacting with JSON APIs.

To get and run *httpie* you will need python installed on your local system.

```
pip3 install httpie
```

Grab the httpie configuration files from the repository and set them up to work in your environment.

```
mkdir -p ~/.config/httpie
cp .config/httpie/config.json ~/.config/httpie
cp session.json ~/.config/httpie
```

Here are steps to take to set up FusionAuth and configure it to provide login and logout functionality for your application.

- [1. Create User](#1-create-user)
- [2. Register User](#2-register-user)
- [3. Install and Run the Node.js Application](#3-install-and-run-the-nodejs-application)
- [4. Test the Application](#3-test-the-application)
- [5. Logout](#4-logout)
- [6. Summing Up](#5-summing-up)

Steps similar to these will be used for integrating with any identity provider. Let's get into the details of each step. 

## 1. Create User

<FirstStepsCreateUserAPI />

## 2. Register User

<FirstStepsRegisterUserAPI />

## 3. Install and Run the Node Application

<FirstStepsInstallAndRunNodeApplication />

## 4. Test the Application

<FirstStepsTestApplication />

## 5. Logout

<FirstStepsLogout />

Afterwards, you can dig deeper into a number of areas.

## 6. Summing Up
