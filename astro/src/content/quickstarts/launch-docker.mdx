You've chosen to install FusionAuth via Docker and Docker Compose.

This is the best option if you have Docker installed locally or you plan to run FusionAuth in a Docker compatible environment such as Kubernetes and want to learn more about how FusionAuth runs in Docker.

Below is a brief video showing how to set up FusionAuth in less than 5 minutes.

## Requirements

### You need to have Docker installed. 

This document has been tested with Docker version 20, but should work with other versions.

  _Testing the Docker Installation_

  ```
  docker -v
  ```

  _Result Of Testing the Docker Installation_
  ```
  Docker version 20.10.17, build 100c701
  ```


## Install and Start

### Clone the Code
First off, grab the code from the repository and change into that directory.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/synedra/fusionauth-first-steps-launch.git
cd fusionauth-first-steps-launch
```

### Run FusionAuth via Docker

<DockerSpinup kickstartUri={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} />

Once the installer completes, you will see something similar to this output on the console:

```sh title="Docker Install Complete"
fusionauth-1  | 2022-10-29 01:01:16.527 AM INFO  org.primeframework.mvc.netty.PrimeHTTPServer - Starting FusionAuth HTTP server on port [9011]
fusionauth-1  | 2022-10-29 01:01:16.583 AM INFO  org.primeframework.mvc.netty.PrimeHTTPServer - Starting FusionAuth HTTP loopback server on port [9012]
```

And that's it! Docker makes standing up a FusionAuth instance a snap. 

The next step is to pick the kind of interaction you want to have:

<BlogButton label="Web" href="/docs/quickstarts/setup-web" /><span class="mr-3" />
<BlogButton label="API" href="/docs/quickstarts/setup-api" /><span class="mr-3" />

* [Web](/docs/quickstarts/setup-web) uses the FusionAuth web interface to configure access for your website.
* [API](/docs/quickstarts/setup-api) lets you look under the hood and make your configuration changes via FusionAuth's API.
