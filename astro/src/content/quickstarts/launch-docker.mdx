You've chosen to install FusionAuth via Docker and Docker Compose.

This is the best option if you have Docker installed locally or you plan to run FusionAuth in a Docker compatible environment such as Kubernetes and want to learn more about how FusionAuth runs in Docker.

Below is a brief video showing how to set up FusionAuth in less than 5 minutes.

## Requirements

### You need to have Docker installed. 

This document has been tested with Docker version 20, but should work with other versions.

  _Testing the Docker Installation_

  ```
  docker -v
  ```

  _Result Of Testing the Docker Installation_
  ```
  Docker version 20.10.17, build 100c701
  ```


## Install and Start

### Clone the Code
First off, grab the code from the repository and change into that directory.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/synedra/fusionauth-first-steps-launch.git
cd fusionauth-first-steps-launch
```

### Run FusionAuth via Docker

<DockerSpinup kickstartUri={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} />

Once the installer completes, you will see something similar to this output on the console:

```sh title="Docker Install Complete"
fusionauth-1  | 2022-10-29 01:01:16.527 AM INFO  org.primeframework.mvc.netty.PrimeHTTPServer - Starting FusionAuth HTTP server on port [9011]
fusionauth-1  | 2022-10-29 01:01:16.583 AM INFO  org.primeframework.mvc.netty.PrimeHTTPServer - Starting FusionAuth HTTP loopback server on port [9012]
```

And that's it! Docker makes standing up a FusionAuth instance a snap. Return to the <a href="/docs/quickstarts#

From here, you can return to the <a href="/docs/quickstarts#setup">guide</a> to continue on to the next step.

## Summing Up

To verify that your system is set up, navigate to http://localhost:9011 and be sure you can see the FusionAuth UI.  

You're done with step 1... congratulations!  You've got your own FusionAuth server running on your system.
Your system has been set up using a Kickstart to pre-populate the tutorial environment with an application and some users. 
Feel free to explore what's available before moving on to configuring your application's security using FusionAuth.
