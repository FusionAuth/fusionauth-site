You've chosen to install FusionAuth via Docker and Docker Compose.

This is the best option if you have Docker installed locally or you plan to run FusionAuth in a Docker compatible environment such as Kubernetes and want to learn more about how FusionAuth runs in Docker.

If you've arrived here directly, start with the [5-Minute Setup Guide Overview](/docs/quickstarts/5-minute-setup-guide).

Below is a brief video showing how to set up FusionAuth in less than 5 minutes.

## Install and Start

To get started with FusionAuth, you will need to install and start it in Docker.

You are following the Docker 5 minute guide, so you'll use `docker compose`.

Once the installer completes, you will see something similar to this output on the console:

```sh title="Docker Install Complete"
fusionauth-1  | 2022-10-29 01:01:16.527 AM INFO  org.primeframework.mvc.netty.PrimeHTTPServer - Starting FusionAuth HTTP server on port [9011]
fusionauth-1  | 2022-10-29 01:01:16.583 AM INFO  org.primeframework.mvc.netty.PrimeHTTPServer - Starting FusionAuth HTTP loopback server on port [9012]
```

And that's it! Docker makes standing up a FusionAuth instance a snap. 

To verify that your system is set up, navigate to http://localhost:9011 and be sure you can see the FusionAuth UI.  

You're done with step 1... congratulations!  You've got your own FusionAuth server running in docker.
Your system has been set up using a Kickstart to pre-populate the tutorial environment with an application and some users. 
Feel free to explore what's available before heading to step 2 - configuring your application's security using FusionAuth.

Next is step 2, where you can view a tutorial about configuring FusionAuth using the web UI, or interact directly with FusionAuth's APIs from the command line.
