In this quickstart, you will build an application with {frontmatter.technology} and integrate it with FusionAuth. The application is for [ChangeBank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkH-kD73QUM), a global leader in converting dollars into coins. It will have areas reserved for logged in users and public-facing sections.

Find the Docker Compose file and source code for the complete application at <a href={frontmatter.url}>{frontmatter.url}</a>.

## Prerequisites

For this Quickstart, you'll need:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com) 20 or later, which is the quickest way to start FusionAuth. (There are [other ways](/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/)).

## General Architecture

While this sample application doesn't have login functionality without FusionAuth, a more typical integration will replace an existing login system with FusionAuth.

In that case, the system might look like this before FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginBefore alt={"Request flow during login before FusionAuth"}/>

The login flow will look like this after FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginAfter alt={"Request flow during login after FusionAuth"}/>

In general, you would introduce FusionAuth to normalize and consolidate user data, making it consistent and up-to-date and offloading your login security and functionality to FusionAuth.

## Getting Started

In this section, you’ll get FusionAuth up and running and create a new {frontmatter.technology} application.

### Clone The Code

First, clone the code from the repository and change into that directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-wordpress-web.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-wordpress-web
```

All shell commands in this guide can be entered in a terminal in this directory. On Windows, you need to replace forward slashes with backslashes in paths.

If you prefer to copy the files you’ll create in this guide, they already exist in the `complete-application` directory.

### Run FusionAuth Via Docker

You'll find a Docker Compose file `docker-compose.yml` and an environment variables configuration file `.env` in the root directory of the repository.

Assuming you have Docker installed on your machine, you can start FusionAuth and {frontmatter.technology} on your machine with the following.

```
docker compose up -d
```

This will start five containers, one each for FusionAuth, Postgres, Elasticsearch, MySQL for {frontmatter.technology}, and {frontmatter.technology}.

Here you are using a bootstrapping feature of FusionAuth, called [Kickstart](/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/kickstart). When FusionAuth starts for the first time, it will look at the `kickstart/kickstart.json` file and configure FusionAuth to your specified state.

<Aside type="note">
If you ever want to reset the FusionAuth system, delete the volumes created by `docker-compose` by executing `docker compose down -v`, then rerun `docker compose up -d`.
</Aside>

FusionAuth will be configured with these settings:

* Your client Id is `e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e`.
* Your client secret is `super-secret-secret-that-should-be-regenerated-for-production`.
* Your example username is `richard@example.com` and the password is `password`.
* Your admin username is `admin@example.com` and the password is `password`.
* The base URL of FusionAuth is `http://localhost:9011/`.

You can log in to the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin) and look around if you want to, but with Docker and Kickstart, everything will already be configured correctly.

<Aside type="caution">
  The `.env` and `kickstart.json` files contain passwords. In a real application, always add these files to your `.gitignore` file and never commit secrets to version control.
</Aside>

### Create A Basic {frontmatter.technology} Application

Next, you'll set up a basic {frontmatter.technology} site. While this guide builds a new {frontmatter.technology} project, you can use the same method to integrate your existing project with FusionAuth.

<Aside type="note">
If you simply want to run the application, there is a completed version in the `complete-application` directory. You can use the following commands to get it up and running if you do not want to create your own.

```shell
cd complete-application
docker compose up
```

Then view the application at the following URL http://localhost:3000.
</Aside>

### Preliminary Setup

Browse to http://localhost:3000. It should automatically redirect you to http://localhost:3000/wp-admin/install.php, as this is a brand-new site.

Choose "English (United States)" and click <Uielement label="Continue"/>.

On the next page:

- Set <Field label="Site Title"/> to `Change Bank`.
- Set <Field label="Username"/> to `admin` and <Field label="Password"/> to `password`.
- Enable <Field label="Confirm use of weak password"/>.
- Set <Field label="Your Email"/> to `admin@example.com`.
- Click <Uielement label="Install WordPress"/>.

<img src="/img/quickstarts/quickstart-wordpress-web/wp-welcome.png" alt="Wordpress configuration"/>

On the success page, click <Uielement label="Log In"/>. On the login page, enter the username `admin` and password `password` and click <Uielement label="Log In"/>. (You can return to this page later by browsing to http://localhost:3000/wp-login.php.)

### Create Placeholder Pages

Before you do any FusionAuth work, you'll create three placeholder pages:
- A home page that anonymous users can see.
- A make change page that only logged in users can see.
- An account page that only logged in users can see.

Under <Breadcrumb label="Settings -> Permalinks"/>, change <Field label="Permalink structure"/> to `Post name` and click <Uielement label="Save Changes"/>. This sets page URLs to be more human-readable than the default numbered URLs.

<img src="/img/quickstarts/quickstart-wordpress-web/permalink.png" alt="Permalinks"/>

To add the placeholder pages, first delete the default pages:

- Click <Breadcrumb label="Pages"/> in the sidebar.
- Select the two existing sample pages.
- Under <Breadcrumb label="Bulk Actions"/>, click <Uielement label="Move to Trash"/>.
- Click <Uielement label="Apply"/>.

Now create new blank pages:

- Click <Uielement label="Add New"/>.
- Under <Field label="Add Title"/> enter `Home`.
- Under <Breadcrumb label="Template"/> on the far right, click <Uielement label="Pages"/>, and change it to <Uielement label="Blank"/>.
- Click <Uielement label="Publish"/>, confirm, and note the URL has been updated to one you can browse to.
- Click the <Uielement label="WP"/> icon on the top left to return to the pages screen. 
- Repeat these steps to create and publish two more pages, one with the title `Account` and one with the title `Change`.

You now have three blank pages.

<img src="/img/quickstarts/quickstart-wordpress-web/home.png" alt="Add page"/>

Browse to <Breadcrumb label="Settings -> Reading"/>. Change <Field label="Your homepage displays"/> to `A static page` and under <Field label="Homepage"/> select `Home`. Save your changes. Now http://localhost:3000 points to your homepage.

<img src="/img/quickstarts/quickstart-wordpress-web/reading.png" alt="Homepage"/>

Finally, browse to <Breadcrumb label="Appearance -> Editor -> Templates -> Blank"/>. Here you are editing the page style template for all three of your new pages. Click on the paragraph (`This is the Post Content block`) twice to select it. Under <Breadcrumb label="Layout"/> on the right, disable <Uielement label="Inner blocks use content width"/>. Click <Uielement label="Save"/> and confirm. This changes each page to use the full browser width.

<img src="/img/quickstarts/quickstart-wordpress-web/blank-template.png" alt="Full width setting"/>

## Authentication

You now have a basic {frontmatter.technology} site with three blank pages. Currently, logging in is scoped to this site only, with its own private MySQL server. Next, you will enable WordPress to use FusionAuth for logging in so that your users can use the same FusionAuth login credentials with this site as any future ones you make.

On the {frontmatter.technology} dashboard, click <Breadcrumb label="Plugins -> Add new"/>. In the search box on the right, paste "OpenID Connect Generic Client". On the first plugin in the results, by daggerhart, click <Uielement label="Install Now"/>, then <Uielement label="Activate"/>.

<img src="/img/quickstarts/quickstart-wordpress-web/oidc-plugin.png" alt="Add a plugin"/>

Browse to <Breadcrumb label="Settings -> Open ID Connect Client"/> and enter the following settings:

- <Field label="Client ID"/> - `E9FDB985-9173-4E01-9D73-AC2D60D1DC8E`
- <Field label="Client Secret Key"/> - `super-secret-secret-that-should-be-regenerated-for-production`
- <Field label="OpenID Scope"/> - `openid`
- <Field label="Login Endpoint URL"/> - `http://localhost:9011/oauth2/authorize`
- <Field label="Userinfo Endpoint URL"/> - `http://fusionauth:9011/oauth2/userinfo`
- <Field label="Token Validation Endpoint URL"/> - `http://fusionauth:9011/oauth2/token`
- <Field label="End Session Endpoint URL"/> - `http://localhost:9011/oauth2/logout`
- <Field label="Nickname Key"/> - `sub`
- <Field label="Display Name Formatting"/> - `{email}` (this is what will be displayed to the user in the {frontmatter.technology} admin screen)
- Enable <Uielement label="Link Existing Users"/> - this marks a user in your local {frontmatter.technology} database who has the same email in FusionAuth as the same user, instead of duplicating them.

Click <Uielement label="Save Changes"/>.

<img src="/img/quickstarts/quickstart-wordpress-web/oidc-config.png" alt="Configure FusionAuth"/>

Now if you browse to http://localhost:3000/wp-login.php, you can click <Uielement label="Login with OpenID Connect"/> and log in on FusionAuth with email `admin@example.com` and password `password`.


### Prevent Default Login

For a simpler user experience, you can remove the option to log in with {frontmatter.technology}. This is an optional step.

Open a terminal and run the following command to overwrite the default `wp-login.php` file.

```shell
docker cp ./complete-application/wp-login.php fusionauth-quickstart-wordpress-web-wordpress-1:/var/www/html/wp-login.php
```

The new file starts commenting out the login form on line 1424 with `<!--`, and ends the comment on line 1504 with `-->`.

Now http://localhost:3000/wp-login.php looks much neater.

### Restrict Pages To Logged In Users

Currently, if you log out, you can still browse to the pages that should be restricted, like `http://localhost:3000/account`. Let's prevent that.

At <Breadcrumb label="Plugins -> Add New"/>, search for "simple page access restriction" and install and activate the one by Plugins & Snippets. Browse to the plugin settings in the sidebar. Set the following values:

- <Field label="Login Redirect Type"/> - "URL".
- <Field label="Login Redirect URL"/> - `http://localhost:3000/wp-login.php`.
- Click <Uielement label="Save Changes"/>.

<img src="/img/quickstarts/quickstart-wordpress-web/page-restrict.png" alt="Restrict pages"/>

Back in <Breadcrumb label="Pages"/>, for both the account and change pages, click <Uielement label="Edit"/>, enable <Uielement label="For Logged-In Users Only"/> at the bottom right, and click <Uielement label="Update"/>. Now if you log out and browse to either page, you won't be able to view it.

<img src="/img/quickstarts/quickstart-wordpress-web/for-logged-in.png" alt="Page settings"/>

### Send User To Account After Log In

The final improvement you can make to the login process is to send the user directly to their account page instead of the dashboard after login.

Search for and install the plugin "Remove Dashboard Access" by TrustedLogin.

Browse to <Breadcrumb label="Settings -> Dashboard Access"/>. Change the value of <Field label="Redirect URL"/> to `http://localhost:3000/account`. Click <Uielement label="Save Changes"/>.

<img src="/img/quickstarts/quickstart-wordpress-web/dash-access.png" alt="Page settings"/>

Now if you log out and log in as `richard@example.com`, who is not an administrator, you'll be redirected to the account page. Log in again as `admin@example.com` to continue editing the site.

## Customization

You now have everything you need to configure FusionAuth authentication on your site. To complete this demonstration application, you'll add some content to the three blank pages. There are many ways to create custom pages on {frontmatter.technology}, including:

- Editing the theme.
- Making a child theme and editing that.
- Adding new template files for each page.
- Making custom shortcodes.
- Making custom blocks.
- Making custom plugins.

The easiest way to demonstrate the ChangeBank sample pages is to paste custom content into a plugin, but note that is not the most maintainable solution for a real site. If your site is large or complex, rather take the time to study custom themes and create your own.

For now, search for and add the plugin "WP Coder" by Wow-Company.

### Add An Image

Browse to <Breadcrumb label="Media"/> in the sidebar. Click <Uielement label="Add New"/> and select `money.jpg` from the `complete-application` directory.

<img src="/img/quickstarts/quickstart-wordpress-web/media.png" alt="Add image"/>

Click on the image once it has been uploaded. Copy the "File URL" to use later. It should look like `http://localhost:3000/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/money.jpg`.

### Add Custom Page Shortcodes

You'll now create three shortcodes with the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for each page.

Browse to <Breadcrumb label="Wow Plugins -> WP Coder"/>. Click <Uielement label="Add New"/>. In the title box at the top, enter `home`. In the <Field label="HTML code"/> box, copy the file contents from `complete-application/home.html`. In the `<img src` at the bottom of this code, enter the file URL for the money image you uploaded. Click the <Breadcrumb label="CSS Code"/> tab, and copy the file contents from `changebank.css`. Click <Uielement label="Save Changes"/>.

<img src="/img/quickstarts/quickstart-wordpress-web/wp-coder.png" alt="Create home shortcode"/>

Repeat this process for the account and change pages. 

- For the account page, use the file contents from `account.html` and `changebank.css`. You don't need to change any image URLs for this page.
- For the change page, use `change.html` and `changebank.css`. For this page, also click on the <Breadcrumb label="JS Code"/> tab and add the contents of `change.js`.

In the list tab of the WP Coder plugin, you can see the shortcodes of each page, like `[WP-Coder title="home"]`. You'll use these codes to link the custom code to the actual page.

### Add Email Shortcode Plugin

Add the plugin "Snippet Shortcodes" by Ali Colville. This plugin enables the shortcode `[sv slug="sc-user-email"]`, which you might have noticed in the HTML of the account and change pages. The shortcode displays the user's email on the page.

### Add The Shortcodes To The Pages

Now you can use these shortcodes on the three pages. Browse to <Breadcrumb label="Pages"/> and edit the account page. Click the hamburger menu at the top right and select <Uielement label="Code editor"/>. In the text box under the page title box, paste `[WP-Coder title="account"]` and click <Uielement label="Update"/>.

Go back to the page list and edit the home page. Paste `[WP-Coder title="home"]` and click <Uielement label="Update"/>.

Edit the change page, paste `[WP-Coder title="change"]`, and click <Uielement label="Update"/>.

Each of your previously blank pages now displays the custom HTML and CSS you added to the WP Coder custom shortcodes.

## Run The Application

The demonstration application is now complete. Log out. Verify that you can't browse to the [account page](http://localhost:3000/account). Log in using `richard@example.com` and `password`. The make change page will allow you to enter a dollar amount to see how many nickels and pennies you will get.

## Next Steps

This quickstart is a great way to get a proof of concept up and running quickly, but to run your application in production, there are some things you're going to want to do.

### FusionAuth Customization

FusionAuth gives you the ability to customize just about everything to do with the user's experience and the integration of your application. This includes:
* [Hosted pages](/docs/v1/tech/themes/) such as login, registration, email verification, and many more.
* [Email templates](/docs/v1/tech/email-templates/email-templates).
* [User data and custom claims in access token JWTs](/articles/tokens/jwt-components-explained).

### Security

* You may want to customize the [token expiration times and policies](/docs/v1/tech/oauth/#configure-application-oauth-settings) in FusionAuth.
* Choose [password rules](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/tenants#password) and a [hashing algorithm](/docs/v1/tech/reference/password-hashes) that meet your security needs.

### Tenant And Application Management

* Model your application topology using [Applications](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/applications), [Roles](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/roles), [Groups](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/groups), [Entities](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/groups), and more.
* Set up [MFA](/docs/v1/tech/guides/multi-factor-authentication), [Social login](/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers/), or [SAML](/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers/samlv2/) integrations.
* Integrate with external systems using [Webhooks](/docs/v1/tech/events-webhooks/), [SCIM](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/scim), and [Lambdas](/docs/v1/tech/lambdas/).

## Troubleshooting

* I get "This site can’t be reached localhost refused to connect" when I click the login button.

Ensure FusionAuth is running in the Docker container. You should be able to log in as the admin user `admin@example.com` with a password of `password` at [http://localhost:9011/admin](http://localhost:9011/admin).

* `docker compose` command is not found.

Ensure you have the latest version of Docker, or try `docker-compose` instead. If on Linux, install `docker.ce` instead of `docker.io`.

* It still doesn't work.

Run the following in a terminal.

```shell
cd complete-application
docker compose up
```

Browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and log in with `admin@example.com` and `password`.

Now you can look around at the settings and plugins to see how the completed working application differs from yours.
