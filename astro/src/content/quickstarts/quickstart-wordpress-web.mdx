In this quickstart, you will build an application with {frontmatter.technology} and integrate it with FusionAuth. The application is for [ChangeBank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkH-kD73QUM), a global leader in converting dollars into coins. It will have areas reserved for logged in users and public-facing sections.

Find the Docker Compose file and source code for the complete application at [{frontmatter.url}]({frontmatter.url}).

## Prerequisites

For this Quickstart, you'll need:

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) 18 or later.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com) 20 or later, which is the quickest way to start FusionAuth. (There are [other ways](/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/)).

## General Architecture

While this sample application doesn't have login functionality without FusionAuth, a more typical integration will replace an existing login system with FusionAuth.

In that case, the system might look like this before FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginBefore alt={"Request flow during login before FusionAuth"}/>

The login flow will look like this after FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginAfter alt={"Request flow during login after FusionAuth"}/>

In general, you would introduce FusionAuth to normalize and consolidate user data, making it consistent and up-to-date and offloading your login security and functionality to FusionAuth.

## Getting Started

Start with getting FusionAuth up and running and creating a new {frontmatter.technology} application.

### Clone The Code

First, grab the code from the repository and change into that folder.

```
git clone {frontmatter.url}.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-wordpress-web
```

All shell commands in this guide can be entered in a terminal in this folder. On Windows, you need to replace forward slashes with backslashes in paths.

All the files out of which you'll copy code in this guide already exist in the `complete-application` subfolder.

### Run FusionAuth Via Docker

You'll find a Docker Compose file `docker-compose.yml` and an environment variables configuration file `.env` in the root folder of the repository.

Assuming you have Docker installed on your machine, you can start FusionAuth and {frontmatter.technology} on your machine with the following.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start five containers, one each for FusionAuth, Postgres, Elasticsearch, Postgres for {frontmatter.technology}, and {frontmatter.technology}. The diagram below shows the component dependencies in the YAML file.

<DockerDependencies alt={"Docker dependencies"}/>

Here you are using a bootstrapping feature of FusionAuth, called [Kickstart](/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/kickstart). When FusionAuth starts for the first time, it will look at the `kickstart/kickstart.json` file and configure FusionAuth to your specified state.

<Aside type="note">
If you ever want to reset the FusionAuth system, delete the volumes created by `docker-compose` by executing `docker-compose down -v`, then rerun `docker-compose up -d`.
</Aside>

FusionAuth will be configured with these settings:

* Your client Id is `e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e`.
* Your client secret is `super-secret-secret-that-should-be-regenerated-for-production`.
* Your example username is `richard@example.com` and the password is `password`.
* Your admin username is `admin@example.com` and the password is `password`.
* The base URL of FusionAuth is `http://localhost:9011/`.

You can log in to the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin) and look around if you want to, but with Docker and Kickstart, everything will already be configured correctly.

<Aside type="caution">
  The `.env` and `kickstart.json` files contain passwords. In a real application, always add these files to your `.gitignore` file and never commit secrets to version control.
</Aside>

### Create A Basic {frontmatter.technology} Application

Next, you'll set up a basic {frontmatter.technology} site. While this guide builds a new {frontmatter.technology} project, you can use the same method to integrate your existing project with FusionAuth.

### Preliminary Setup

Browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). It should automatically redirect you to [http://localhost:3000/wp-admin/install.php](http://localhost:3000/wp-admin/install.php), as this is a brand new site.

Choose <span class="uielement">English (United States)</span> and click `Continue`.

On the next page:
- Set [uielement]#Site Title# to `Change Bank`.
- Set [uielement]#Username# and [uielement]#Password# to `u`.
- Enable [uielement]#Confirm use of weak password#.
- Set [uielement]#Your Email# to `admin@example.com`.
- Click [uielement]#Install WordPress#.

<img src="/img/quickstarts/quickstart-wordpress-web/1.jpg" alt="Wordpress configuration"/>

On the success page, click `login`. On the log in page, enter the username and password `u` and click `Log In`. (You can return to this page later by browsing to [http://localhost:3000/wp-login.php](http://localhost:3000/wp-login.php)).

### Create Placeholder Pages

Before you do any FusionAuth work, you're going to create three placeholder pages:
- A home page, that anonymous users can see.
- A change page and account page, that only logged in users can see.

Under Settings - Permalinks, change Permalink structure to Post name and click Save Changes. This sets page URLs to be more human-readable than the default numbered URLs.

<img src="/img/quickstarts/quickstart-wordpress-web/5.jpg" alt="Permalinks"/>

To add the placeholder pages, do the following:
- Click Pages in the sidebar.
- Select the two existing sample pages.
- Under Bulk Actions, click Move to Trash.
- Click Apply.

The default pages are now gone. Continue:
- Click Add New.
- Under Add Title enter Home.
- Under Template on the far right, click Pages, and change it to Blank.
- Note the URL, click Publish, confirm, and notice the URL has updated.
- Click the WP icon on the top left to return to the pages screen. Now add two more blank pages in the same way as the previous steps. Set their titles to Account and Change, and publish them.

You now have three blank pages.

<img src="/img/quickstarts/quickstart-wordpress-web/6.jpg" alt="Add page"/>

Browse to Settings - Readings. Change Your homepage displays to A static page and under Homepage select Home. Now [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) points to your homepage.

<img src="/img/quickstarts/quickstart-wordpress-web/7.jpg" alt="Homepage"/>

Finally, browse to Appearance - Editor - Templates - Blank. You are now editing the page style template for all of your three new pages. Click on the paragraph (`This is the Post Content block`) twice to select it. Under Layout on the right, disable Inner blocks use content width, and Save and confirm. This changes each page to use the full browser width.

<img src="/img/quickstarts/quickstart-wordpress-web/13.jpg" alt="Full width setting"/>

## Authentication

You now have a basic {frontmatter.technology} site with three blank pages. Currently, logging in is scoped to this site only, with its own private PostgreSQL server. So you're going to connect FusionAuth, in order to use a single username and password for each user, that you might want to reuse to log in to another forum or site.

On the {frontmatter.technology} dashboard, Click `Plugins` -> `Add new`. In the search box on the right, paste `OpenID Connect Generic Client`. On the first plugin in the results, by daggerhart, click `Install Now`, then `Activate`.

<img src="/img/quickstarts/quickstart-wordpress-web/2.jpg" alt="Add a plugin"/>

Browse to `Settings` -> `Open ID Connect Client` and enter the following settings:
- Client ID - `E9FDB985-9173-4E01-9D73-AC2D60D1DC8E`
- Client Secret Key - `super-secret-secret-that-should-be-regenerated-for-production`
- OpenID Scope -`openid`
- Login Endpoint URL - `http://localhost:9011/oauth2/authorize`
- Userinfo Endpoint URL - `http://fusionauth:9011/oauth2/userinfo`
- Token Validation Endpoint URL - `http://fusionauth:9011/oauth2/token`
- End Session Endpoint URL - `http://localhost:9011/oauth2/logout`
- Nickname Key - `sub`
- Display Name Formatting - `{email}`. This is what will be displayed to the user in the {frontmatter.technology} admin screen.
- Enable `Link Existing Users`. If users in your local {frontmatter.technology} database have the same emails as users in your FusionAuth database those users can log in.

Click `Save Changes`.

<img src="/img/quickstarts/quickstart-wordpress-web/3.jpg" alt="Configure FusionAuth"/>

Now if you browse to [http://localhost:3000/wp-login.php](http://localhost:3000/wp-login.php) you can click `Login with OpenID Connect` and log in on FusionAuth with email `admin@example.com` and password `password`.

<img src="/img/quickstarts/quickstart-wordpress-web/4.jpg" alt="Log in"/>

### Prevent Default Login

For a simpler user experience, you're going to remove the option to log in with WordPress. This is an optional step.

Open a terminal and run the following command to overwrite the default `wp-login.php` file.
```bash
docker cp ./complete-application/wp-login.php fusionauth-quickstart-wordpress-web-wordpress-1:/var/www/html/wp-login.php
```

The new file starts commenting out the login form on line 1424 with `<!--`, and ends the comment on line 1504 with `-->`.

Now [http://localhost:3000/wp-login.php](http://localhost:3000/wp-login.php) looks much neater.

### Restrict Pages To Logged In Users

Currently, if you log out, you can still browse to the pages that should be restricted, like `localhost:3000/account`. Let's prevent that.

At Plugins - Add New search for `simple page access restriction` and install and activate the one by Plugins & Snippets. Browse to the plugin settings in the sidebar. Set the following values:
- Login Redirect Type - URL
- Login Redirect URL - http://localhost:3000/wp-login.php
- Click Save Changes.

<img src="/img/quickstarts/quickstart-wordpress-web/8.jpg" alt="Restrict pages"/>

Back in Pages, for both the Account and Change page, click Edit, enable `For Logged-In Users Only` at the bottom right, and click Update. Now if you log out and browse to either page you won't be able to view it.

<img src="/img/quickstarts/quickstart-wordpress-web/9.jpg" alt="Page settings"/>

### Send User To Account After Log In

The final improvement you can make to the log in process is to send the user directly to their account page after logging in. Currently they get sent to the dashboard.

Search for and install the plugin Remove Dashboard Access by TrustedLogin.

Browse to Settings - Dashboard Access. Change the value of Redirect URL to http://localhost:3000/account. Click Save Changes.

<img src="/img/quickstarts/quickstart-wordpress-web/10.jpg" alt="Page settings"/>

Now if you log out and log in as `richard@example.com`, who is not an administrator, you'll be redirected to the account page. Log in again as `admin@example.com` to continue editing the site.

## Customization

At this point you know everything you need to configure FusionAuth authentication on your own site. To finish this demonstration application you're going to add some content to the three blank pages. There are many ways to create custom pages on {frontmatter.technology}, including
- Editing the theme.
- Making a child theme and editing that.
- Adding new template files for each page.
- Making custom shortcodes.
- Making custom blocks.
- Making custom plugins.

The easiest way to demonstrate the FusionAuth sample pages is to paste custom content into a plugin, but note that is not the most maintainable solution for a real site. If your own site is large or complex, rather take the time to study custom themes and create your own.

For now, search for and add the plugin WP Coder by Wow-Company.

### Add An Image

Browse to Media in the sidebar. Click Add New and select `money.jpg` from the `complete-application` folder.

<img src="/img/quickstarts/quickstart-wordpress-web/11.jpg" alt="Add image"/>

Click on the image once it's uploaded. Copy the File URL for use later. It should look like `http://localhost:3000/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/money-scaled.jpg`.

### Add Custom Page Shortcodes

You're now going to create three shortcodes with the HTML, CSS, and JS for each page.

Browse to Wow Plugins - WP Coder. Click Add New. In the title box at the top, enter `home`. In the HTML box, copy the file contents from `complete-application/home.html`. In the `<img src` at the bottom, enter the file URL for the money image you uploaded. Click the CSS Code tab, and copy the file contents from `changebank.css`. Click Save Changes.

<img src="/img/quickstarts/quickstart-wordpress-web/12.jpg" alt="Create home shortcode"/>

Repeat this process for the account page. Use the file contents from `account.html` and `changebank.css`. You don't need to change any image URLs this time.

Add one last page, the change page. Use `change.html` and `changebank.css`. For this page, also click on the JS Code tab. Add the content of `change.js`.

In the list tab of the WP Coder plugin you can see the shortcodes of each page, like `[WP-Coder title="home"]`. You'll use these codes to link the custom code to the actual page in a minute.

### Add Email Shortcode Plugin

Add the plugin Snippet Shortcodes by Ali Colville. This enables the shortcode `[sv slug="sc-user-email"]`, which you might have noticed in the account and change page HTML. It displays the user's email on the page.

### Add The Shortcodes To The Pages

The last thing left to do is use these three page shortcodes on the actual pages. Browse to Pages and edit the Account page. Click the hamburger menu at the top right and select Code editor. Now in the text box under the page title box, paste `[WP-Coder title="account"]`, and click Update.

Go back to the page list and edit the Home page. Paste `[WP-Coder title="home"]` and Update.

Edit the Change page, paste `[WP-Coder title="change"]`, and Update.

Each of your previously blank pages now displays the custom HTML and CSS you added to the WP Code custom shortcodes.

## Run The Application

The demonstration application is now complete. Log out. Verify that you can't browse to the [account page](http://localhost:3000/account). Log in using `richard@example.com` and `password`. The change page will allow you to enter a number.

## Next Steps

This quickstart is a great way to get a proof of concept up and running quickly, but to run your application in production, there are some things you're going to want to do.

### FusionAuth Customization

FusionAuth gives you the ability to customize just about everything to do with the user's experience and the integration of your application. This includes:
* [Hosted pages](/docs/v1/tech/themes/) such as login, registration, email verification, and many more.
* [Email templates](/docs/v1/tech/email-templates/email-templates).
* [User data and custom claims in access token JWTs](/articles/tokens/jwt-components-explained).

### Security

* You may want to customize the [token expiration times and policies](/docs/v1/tech/oauth/#configure-application-oauth-settings) in FusionAuth.
* Choose [password rules](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/tenants#password) and a [hashing algorithm](/docs/v1/tech/reference/password-hashes) that meet your security needs.

### Tenant And Application Management

* Model your application topology using [Applications](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/applications), [Roles](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/roles), [Groups](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/groups), [Entities](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/groups), and more.
* Set up [MFA](/docs/v1/tech/guides/multi-factor-authentication), [Social login](/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers/), or [SAML](/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers/samlv2/) integrations.
* Integrate with external systems using [Webhooks](/docs/v1/tech/events-webhooks/), [SCIM](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/scim), and [Lambdas](/docs/v1/tech/lambdas/).

## Troubleshooting

* I get "This site can’t be reached localhost refused to connect" when I click the login button.

Ensure FusionAuth is running in the Docker container. You should be able to log in as the admin user `admin@example.com` with a password of `password` at [http://localhost:9011/admin](http://localhost:9011/admin).

* `docker compose` command is not found.

Ensure you have the latest version of Docker, or try `docker-compose` instead. If on Linux, install `docker.ce` instead of `docker.io`.
