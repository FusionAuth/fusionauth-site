In this quickstart you are going to build an application with React Native and integrate it with FusionAuth.
You'll be building it for [ChangeBank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXDxNCzUspM), a global leader in converting dollars into coins.
It'll have areas reserved for users who have logged in as well as public facing sections.

The docker compose file and source code for a complete application are available at
https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-react-native

## Prerequisites

- [Node](https://nodejs.org): This will be used to set up your project.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com): The quickest way to stand up FusionAuth. (There are [other ways](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/)).
- To test on Android devices, you can either connect a physical device or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) to set up an emulator.
- To test on iOS devices, you'll need a Mac and install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) to set up an emulator.

This app has been tested with React Native 0.72.4 and Node 20. This example should work with other compatible versions of React Native.

## General Architecture

While this sample application doesn't have login functionality without FusionAuth, a more typical integration will replace an existing login system with FusionAuth.

In that case, the system might look like this before FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginBefore alt={"Request flow during login before FusionAuth"}/>

The login flow will look like this after FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginAfter alt={"Request flow during login after FusionAuth"}/>

In general, you are introducing FusionAuth in order to normalize and consolidate user data. This helps make sure it is consistent and up-to-date as well as offloading your login security and functionality to FusionAuth.

## Getting Started

In this section, you'll get FusionAuth up and running and use `npx` to create a new application.

### Clone the Code

First off, grab the code from the repository and change into that directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-react-native.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-react-native
```

### Run FusionAuth via Docker

In the root directory of the repo you'll find a Docker compose file (`docker-compose.yml`) and an environment variables configuration file (`.env`). Assuming you have Docker installed on your machine, you can stand up FusionAuth up on your machine with:

```
docker compose up -d
```

Here you are using a bootstrapping feature of FusionAuth, called [Kickstart](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/kickstart). When FusionAuth comes up for the first time, it will look at the `kickstart/kickstart.json` file and configure FusionAuth to a certain initial state.

<Aside type="note">
  If you ever want to reset the FusionAuth system, delete the volumes created by Docker Compose by executing `docker compose down -v`, then re-run `docker compose up -d`.
</Aside>

FusionAuth will be initially configured with these settings:

* Your client Id is <code><RemoteValue url={`${GITHUB_URL}kickstart/kickstart.json`} selector="$.variables.applicationId" /></code>
* Your client secret is <code><RemoteValue url={`${GITHUB_URL}kickstart/kickstart.json`} selector="$.variables.clientSecret" /></code>.
* Your example username is <code><RemoteValue url={`${GITHUB_URL}kickstart/kickstart.json`} selector="$.variables.userEmail" /></code> and the password is <code><RemoteValue url={`${GITHUB_URL}kickstart/kickstart.json`} selector="$.variables.userPassword" /></code>.
* Your admin username is <code><RemoteValue url={`${GITHUB_URL}kickstart/kickstart.json`} selector="$.variables.adminEmail" /></code> and the password is <code><RemoteValue url={`${GITHUB_URL}kickstart/kickstart.json`} selector="$.variables.adminPassword" /></code>.
* The base URL of FusionAuth `http://localhost:9011/`.

You can log into the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin) and look around if you want, but with Docker/Kickstart you don't need to.

### Expose your Instance

To make the FusionAuth instance running on your machine accessible to the app, you need to [expose it to the Internet following these instructions](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/exposing-instance). Then, copy the address `ngrok` gave you as you'll need it shortly. It looks something like `https://SOME-RANDOM-STRINGS.ngrok-free.app`.

### Create your React Native Application

Now you're going to create a React Native application. While this section builds a simple React Native application, you can use the same configuration to integrate your existing React Native application with FusionAuth.
To make things easier, you're going to use `create-expo-app`, a library that sets up the environment using [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/), a platform that runs natively on all your users' devices

```shell
npx create-expo-app my-react-native-app && cd my-react-native-app
```

You'll have to create all files in the root directory for your application.

<Aside type="note">
  If this is your first time setting up a React Native application, you'll receive a message asking if you want to install `create-expo-app`, so press `y` to confirm.
</Aside>

## Authentication

We'll use the [Expo AuthSession library](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/auth-session/), which simplifies integrating with FusionAuth and creating a secure web application.

### Configure Expo AuthSession

Install `expo-auth-session`, its dependency `expo-crypto` to handle cryptographic operations and `expo-web-browser` to interact with the device Browser in order to log the user in or out.

```shell
npx expo install expo-auth-session expo-crypto expo-web-browser
```

Create a `.env` file to hold information about your FusionAuth instance and application, replacing the value in `EXPO_PUBLIC_FUSIONAUTH_URL` with the address you copied from `ngrok` when [exposing your instance](#expose-your-instance).

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-react-native/main/complete-application/.env"
            lang="ini"/>

Replace `app.json` with the contents below to add some details about your app:
- A `scheme` that will be used when redirecting back to your application after logging in and out of FusionAuth.
- The package name for both Android (`expo.android.package`) and iOS (`expo.ios.bundleIdentifier`) builds.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-react-native/main/complete-application/app.json"
            lang="json"/>

## App Customization

In this section, you'll turn your application into a trivial banking application with some styling.

### Add Styling

First, run the command below to install some libraries needed for theming.

```shell
npm install expo-image expo-constants react-native-currency-input
```

Instead of using CSS, React Native has its own concept of [stylesheets](https://reactnative.dev/docs/stylesheet). Create a file named `changebank.style.js` with the contents below to style your ChangeBank app.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-react-native/main/complete-application/changebank.style.js"
            lang="javascript"/>

Run the command below to download the ChangeBank logo into the `assets` folder.

```shell
wget -O assets/changebank.svg https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-react-native/main/complete-application/assets/changebank.svg
```

## Finish Setting up the App

Replace the existing `App.js` to integrate `expo-auth-session`, add the ChangeBank template, and stitch everything up.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-react-native/main/complete-application/App.js"
            lang="javascript"/>

## Run the App

Depending on where you want to test your app, follow these instructions.
- For Android devices: you can either [connect a physical device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device) or install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) to [set up an emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator).
- For iOS devices: if you are running a Mac, you can install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) to [set up an emulator or run on a physical device](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/running-your-app-in-simulator-or-on-a-device/).

Now that you have a device connected or an emulator running, start up the React Native application from the root `my-react-native-app` directory using the command below.

```shell
npx expo start
```

After waiting a few moments, you should see a QR Code and a menu with some actions. Right below the QR Code, you'll see a message like this one _(the real address may vary)_.

```
â€º Metro waiting on exp://192.168.1.2:8081
```

To use [Expo Go](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/expo-go/), a client for testing your apps on Android and iOS devices without building anything locally, you need to:

* Copy that listening address (`exp://192.168.1.2:8081`).
* Navigate to your FusionAuth instance on [localhost:9011](http://localhost:9011).
* Log in with the email `admin@example.com` and password `password`.
* Browse to **Applications**.
* Click on <IconButton icon="edit" color="blue" /> in your `ExampleReactNativeApp` to edit it.
* Go to the **OAuth** tab.
* Add that address to **Authorized redirect URLs** and append `/--/redirect` to it
  * Example: for `exp://192.168.1.2:8081`, you'd need to add `exp://192.168.1.2:8081/--/redirect` as a redirect URL
* Click on <IconButton icon="save" color="blue" /> to save your changes.

Go back to the terminal with the Expo menu. To test on the connected or emulated Android device, press `a`. Otherwise, press `i` to run on the iOS device.

Wait a few seconds and Expo will build and install the app in your device. You should then see the ChangeBank welcome page. Click the `Log in` button in the top right corner of that screen.

<Aside type="note">
  If it is your first time running the app, ngrok will ask if you really want to continue to that page, so click `Visit Site`.
</Aside>

You'll finally arrive at the FusionAuth login screen. Fill in <code><RemoteValue url={`${GITHUB_URL}kickstart/kickstart.json`} selector="$.variables.userEmail" /></code> and <code><RemoteValue url={`${GITHUB_URL}kickstart/kickstart.json`} selector="$.variables.userPassword" /></code> and click on `Submit` to be redirected back to the logged-in ChangeBank page.

## Next Steps
This quickstart is a great way to get a proof of concept up and running quickly, but to run your application in production, there are some things you're going to want to do.

### FusionAuth Customization
FusionAuth gives you the ability to customize just about everything with the user's experience and your application's integration. This includes
* [Hosted pages](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/) such as login, registration, email verification, and many more
* [Email templates](/docs/customize/email-and-messages/email-templates)
* [User data and custom claims in access token JWTs](/articles/tokens/jwt-components-explained)

### Security
* [Expo AuthSession](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/auth-session/) handles token validation and refresh
* You may want to customize the [token expiration times and policies](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/#configure-application-oauth-settings) in FusionAuth
* Choose [password rules](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/tenants#password) and a [hashing algorithm](/docs/reference/password-hashes) that meet your security needs

### Tenant and Application Management
* Model your application topology using [Applications](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/applications), [Roles](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/roles), [Groups](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/groups), [Entities](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/groups), and more
* Set up [MFA](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/multi-factor-authentication), [Social login](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/identity-providers/), and/or [SAML](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/identity-providers/overview-samlv2) integrations
* Integrate with external systems using [Webhooks](/docs/extend/events-and-webhooks/), [SCIM](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/scim/scim), and [Lambdas](/docs/extend/code/lambdas/)

### Build your App for Distribution

Follow [Expo's "Create your first build" tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/build/setup/) to learn how to create a build for your app.

## Troubleshooting

* I keep receiving an `invalid_redirect_uri` when running the app with Expo Go

Make sure you have updated the **Authorized redirect URLs** in your [FusionAuth instance](http://localhost:9011) like shown on the [Run the App](#run-the-app) step.
