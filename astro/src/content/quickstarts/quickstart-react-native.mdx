## Prerequisites

- [Node](https://nodejs.org): This will be used to set up your project.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com): The quickest way to stand up FusionAuth. (There are [other ways](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/)).
- To test on Android devices, you can either connect a physical device or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) to set up an emulator.
- To test on iOS devices, you'll need a Mac and install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) to set up an emulator.

This app has been tested with React Native 0.72.4 and Node 20. This example should work with other compatible versions of React Native.

## General Architecture

<LoginArchitectureWeb />

## Getting Started

In this section, you'll get FusionAuth up and running and use `npx` to create a new application.

### Clone the Code

First off, grab the code from the repository and change into that directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-react-native.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-react-native
```

### Run FusionAuth via Docker

<DockerSpinup kickstartUri={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} />

### Set Up A Public URL For FusionAuth

<QuickstartNgrok />

### Create your React Native Application

Now you're going to create a React Native application. While this section builds a simple React Native application, you can use the same configuration to integrate your existing React Native application with FusionAuth.
To make things easier, you're going to use `create-expo-app`, a library that sets up the environment using [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/), a platform that runs natively on all your users' devices

```shell
npx create-expo-app my-react-native-app && cd my-react-native-app
```

You'll have to create all files in the root directory for your application.

<Aside type="note">
  If this is your first time setting up a React Native application, you'll receive a message asking if you want to install `create-expo-app`, so press `y` to confirm.
</Aside>

## Authentication

We'll use the [Expo AuthSession library](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/auth-session/), which simplifies integrating with FusionAuth and creating a secure web application.

### Configure Expo AuthSession

Install `expo-auth-session`, its dependency `expo-crypto` to handle cryptographic operations and `expo-web-browser` to interact with the device Browser in order to log the user in or out.

```shell
npx expo install expo-auth-session expo-crypto expo-web-browser
```

Create a `.env` file to hold information about your FusionAuth instance and application, replacing the value in `EXPO_PUBLIC_FUSIONAUTH_URL` with the address you copied from `ngrok` when [exposing your instance](#set-up-a-public-url-for-fusionauth).

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/.env"}
            lang="ini"/>

Replace `app.json` with the contents below to add some details about your app:
- A `scheme` that will be used when redirecting back to your application after logging in and out of FusionAuth.
- The package name for both Android (`expo.android.package`) and iOS (`expo.ios.bundleIdentifier`) builds.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/app.json"}
            lang="json"/>

## App Customization

In this section, you'll turn your application into a trivial banking application with some styling.

### Add Styling

First, run the command below to install some libraries needed for theming.

```shell
npm install expo-image expo-constants react-native-currency-input
```

Instead of using CSS, React Native has its own concept of [stylesheets](https://reactnative.dev/docs/stylesheet). Create a file named `changebank.style.js` with the contents below to style your ChangeBank app.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/changebank.style.js"}
            lang="javascript"/>

Run the command below to download the ChangeBank logo into the `assets` folder.

```shell
wget -O assets/changebank.svg https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-react-native/main/complete-application/assets/changebank.svg
```

## Finish Setting up the App

Replace the existing `App.js` to integrate `expo-auth-session`, add the ChangeBank template, and stitch everything up.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/App.js"}
            lang="javascript"/>

## Run the App

Depending on where you want to test your app, follow these instructions.
- For Android devices: you can either [connect a physical device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device) or install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) to [set up an emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator).
- For iOS devices: if you are running a Mac, you can install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) to [set up an emulator or run on a physical device](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/running-your-app-in-simulator-or-on-a-device/).

Now that you have a device connected or an emulator running, start up the React Native application from the root `my-react-native-app` directory using the command below.

```shell
npx expo start
```

After waiting a few moments, you should see a QR Code and a menu with some actions. Right below the QR Code, you'll see a message like this one _(the real address may vary)_.

```
› Metro waiting on exp://192.168.1.2:8081
```

To use [Expo Go](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/expo-go/), a client for testing your apps on Android and iOS devices without building anything locally, you need to:

* Copy that listening address (`exp://192.168.1.2:8081`).
* Navigate to your FusionAuth instance on [localhost:9011](http://localhost:9011).
* Log in with the email <InlineFieldValue>admin@example.com</InlineFieldValue> and password <InlineFieldValue>password</InlineFieldValue>.
* Navigate to <Breadcrumb>Applications</Breadcrumb>.
* Click on <IconButton icon="edit" color="blue" /> in your `ExampleReactNativeApp` to edit it.
* Go to the <Breadcrumb>OAuth</Breadcrumb> tab.
* Add that address to **Authorized redirect URLs** and append `/--/redirect` to it
  * Example: for `exp://192.168.1.2:8081`, you'd need to add `exp://192.168.1.2:8081/--/redirect` as a redirect URL
* Click on <IconButton icon="save" color="blue" /> to save your changes.

Go back to the terminal with the Expo menu. To test on the connected or emulated Android device, press `a`. Otherwise, press `i` to run on the iOS device.

Wait a few seconds and Expo will build and install the app in your device. You should then see the ChangeBank welcome page. Click the <InlineUIElement>Log in</InlineUIElement> button in the top right corner of that screen.

<Aside type="note">
  If it is your first time running the app, ngrok will ask if you really want to continue to that page, so click <InlineUIElement>Visit Site</InlineUIElement>.
</Aside>

You'll finally arrive at the FusionAuth login screen. Fill in <code><RemoteValue url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "kickstart/kickstart.json"} selector="$.variables.userEmail" /></code> and <code><RemoteValue url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "kickstart/kickstart.json"} selector="$.variables.userPassword" /></code> and click on <InlineUIElement>Submit</InlineUIElement> to be redirected back to the logged-in ChangeBank page.

### Build your App for Distribution

Follow [Expo's "Create your first build" tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/build/setup/) to learn how to create a build for your app.

## Troubleshooting

* I keep receiving an `invalid_redirect_uri` when running the app with Expo Go

Make sure you have updated the **Authorized redirect URLs** in your [FusionAuth instance](http://localhost:9011) like shown on the [Run the App](#run-the-app) step.
