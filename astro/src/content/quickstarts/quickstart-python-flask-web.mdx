This Quickstart will take you through integrating a Python Flask application with FusionAuth, 
setting up an OAuth authorization code grant flow and allowing users to log into your 
application.

In this Quickstart you'll create an application that has
* A Home Page, which is where a logged-out user goes. It has a login button that allows a user to log in
  using FusionAuth
* An Account Page, which is where a user goes when they're logged in. It has a Logout button that allows
  the user to log out with FusionAuth
* The associated back end routes to accomplish all of this

This quickstart will be referencing the example application in the [Flask Quickstart Repo](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web).
You can build your Flask application from scratch, or you can start with the stub application that we've provided.

#### Repository Contents
| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| /docker-compose.yml | A docker-compose config file for standing up a FusionAuth server, a Postgres database, and an Elastic instance |
| /kickstart/ | A directory containing a `kickstart` file, which is used to configure FusionAuth |
| /stub-application/ | A base application that goes with this Quickstart. It runs, but doesn't integrate with FusionAutn (yet) |
| /complete-application/ | A completed application, with a working integration with FusionAuth |

## Prerequisites
For this Quickstart, you'll need Python3.8 or later.

You'll also need Docker, since that's how we'll be running FusionAuth.

The commands below are for macOS, but are limited to basic *nix commands.

## Run FusionAuth
In the root directory of the repo you'll find a Docker compose file (docker-compose.yml) and an environment variables configuration file (.env). Assuming you have Docker installed on your machine, you can stand up FusionAuth up on your machine with:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web
cd fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start three containers, once each for FusionAuth, Postgres, and Elastic. 

The FusionAuth configuration files also make use of a unique feature of FusionAuth, called Kickstart: 
when FusionAuth comes up for the first time, it will look at the Kickstart file and mimic API calls to 
configure FusionAuth for use when it is first run. The Kickstart will set up (among other things):
* An Application and somme associated config including that for OAuth, user registration, and more
* CORS configuration to allow requests from localhost:5000 (your app)
* A couple of users: admin@example.com and richard@example.com

<Aside type="note">
If you ever want to reset the FusionAuth system, delete the volumes created by docker-compose by executing `docker-compose down -v`.
</Aside>

FusionAuth will be configured with these settings
* Your client Id is: `e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e`
* Your client secret is: `super-secret-secret-that-should-be-regenerated-for-production`
* Your example username is `richard@example.com` and your password is `password`
* Your admin username is `admin@example.com` and your password is `password`
* The FusionAuth API is hosted at `http://localhost:9011/`

You can log into the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin) and look around if you want, but with Docker/Kickstart you donâ€™t need to.

## Create a Basic Flask Application
In this section, you'll set up a basic Flask application with a single page.

#### Setup Your Environment
We recommend working in a virtual environment for this.

```shell
python3.8 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
```

Next, create a requirements.txt file to name the project dependencies.

`requirements.txt`
<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/requirements.txt"
 lang="python" />

And then install the dependencies into your virtual env.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Create the Application
Now create your Flask app, which for now will consist of an environment file named `.env` and a python file named `server.py`.

Create the environment file with these contents:

`.env`
<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/.env"
 lang="shell" />

In server.py, you'll add all of the imports you'll need, declare some constants, and initialize the OAuth library.

`server.py`
<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/server.py"
 lang="python"
 tags="baseApplication"/>

<Aside type="tip">
You should be able to start your Flask application with `flask --app server.py --debug run`.
Note that you won't be able to access it with a browser yet!
</Aside>

#### Create a Home Route and a Home Page
The next step is to get a basic home page up and running. This will require a back end route to handle requests to `/` and a web page template.

In the route function, you're going to look for an access token, which is created when a user is successfully authenticated. If the user
is not authenticated, you'll just take them to the home page. However, if they _are_ authenticated, you'll redirect them to 
an `/account` page. Since we haven't implemented login yet, the redirect to `/account` won't work.

Add the route handling function to your server.py file.

`server.py`
<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/server.py"
 lang="python"
 tags="homeRoute"/>

Next, create the home page in a `templates` directory. This page just has a login button, which won't do anything yet. These commands also 
install a CSS file and an image to make your app look nicer.

```shell
mkdir -p templates static/css static/img && \
wget -O templates/home.html https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/templates/home.html && \
wget -O static/css/changebank.css https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/static/css/changebank.css && \
wget -O static/img/money.jpg https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/static/img/money.jpg

```

<Aside type="tip">
With the home page and route complete, you can view the home page in your brower at `http://localhost:5000`.
</Aside>

## Add OAuth Authentication Routes
Next, you'll add a `/login` route that uses authlib to take the user to FusionAuth's OAuth2 `authorize` endpoint, 
and a `/callback` route that FusionAuth will redirect the user back to after a successful login.

FusionAuth will include an authorization code in the redirect to `/callback`, and the callback function will 
make a server-to-server call to FusionAuth to exchange the authorization code for an access token, refresh token, 
and userinfo object. All of this happens in `oauth.FusionAuth.authorize_access_token()`. This sequence of redirects and 
back end calls is known as an OAuth Authorization Code Grant flow.

After your app gets the information back from FusionAuth, you'll write these items to HTTP-only cookies, so that they will 
be returned to the Flask application on subsequent requests, but are not readable by code running in the browser.

We also set the userinfo object in the Flask session, to make it easy to use in rendered templates.

Add the `/login` and `/callback` routes to your server code.

`server.py`
<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/server.py"
 lang="python"
 tags="loginRoute"/>

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/server.py"
 lang="python"
 tags="callbackRoute"/>

<Aside type="tip">
Once these steps are done, you should be able to successfully log into your application! Just note that after logging
in, you're taking the user to `/account`, which doesn't exist yet.
</Aside>

### Add a Secured Page
Remember that after logging in, the application redirects the user to `/`, which then redirects a 
logged in user to '/account'. You going to add that route and page now.

First, create the page template for a logged-in user. It's going to show a personalized header 
and a logout button. 

```shell
wget -O templates/account.html https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/templates/account.html
```

Next, create a route to get to that page. This checks if an access token is present.
If one isn't, it forces a logout at FusionAuth. If one is, it renders the `/account` page.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/server.py"
 lang="python"
 tags="accountRoute"/>

<Aside type="tip">
Now when you log in, you should see the `/account` page!
</Aside>

### Logout
The last step is to implement logout. When you log a user out of an application, you'll take them to 
FusionAuth's `/oauth2/logout` endpoint. After logging the user out, FusionAuth will redirect the user
to your app's `/login` endpoint, which you'll create now. This endpoint deletes any cookies that your
application created, and clears the Flask session.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/server.py"
 lang="python"
 tags="logoutRoute"/>

<Aside type="tip">
Click the `Logout` button and watch the browser first go to FusionAuth to log out the user, then return to your home page.
</Aside>

## Next Steps
If you wanted to improve on this application
* Try adding support for the `Make Change` menu item on the account page. You can look at the complete application in the repository for guidance.
* Properly validate the user's loggined in state.
  * Validate the access token's signature
  * Check that it isn't expired
* Add token refresh
  * If a user has an expired token (or even if they don't), use their refresh token to acquire a new one. If refresh fails,
    that means it's time for the user to log in again
* Add token validation and refresh into a function  decorator that can be easily applied to any route
