## Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com): The quickest way to stand up FusionAuth. (There are [other ways](/docs/get-started/download-and-install)).

This app has been tested with Python 3.8. This example should work with other compatible versions of Python.

## General Architecture

<LoginArchitectureWeb />

## Getting Started
In this section, you'll get FusionAuth up and running and use Flask to create a new application.

### Clone the Code
First off, grab the code from the repository and change into that directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web
```

### Run FusionAuth via Docker

<DockerSpinup kickstartUri={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} />

### Create your Flask Application

In this section, you'll set up a basic Flask application with a single page. While this section builds a simple Python / Flask application, you can use the same method to integrate your existing application with FusionAuth.

#### Set up your Environment

We recommend working in a virtual environment for this.

```shell
python3.8 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
```

Next, create a `requirements.txt` file to name the project dependencies.

`requirements.txt`
<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/requirements.txt"}
 lang="python" />

And then install the dependencies into your virtual env.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Create the Application

Now create your Flask app, which for now will consist of an environment file named `.env` and a Python file named `server.py`.

Create the environment file with these contents:

`.env`
<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/.env"}
 lang="ini" />

In `server.py`, you'll add all of the imports you'll need, declare some constants, and initialize the OAuth library.

`server.py`
<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/server.py"}
 lang="python"
 tags="baseApplication"/>

<Aside type="tip">
  You should be able to start your Flask application with `flask --app server.py --debug run`. Note that you won't be able to access it with a browser yet!
</Aside>

#### Create a Home Route and a Home Page
The next step is to get a basic home page up and running. This will require a back end route to handle requests to `/` and a web page template.

In the route function, you're going to look for an access token, which is created when a user is successfully authenticated. If the user is not authenticated, you'll just take them to the home page. However, if they _are_ authenticated, you'll redirect them to an `/account` page. Since we haven't implemented login yet, the redirect to `/account` won't work.

Add the route handling function to your server.py file.

`server.py`
<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/server.py"}
 lang="python"
 tags="homeRoute"/>

Next, create the home page in a `templates` directory. This page just has a login button, which won't do anything yet. These commands also install a CSS file and an image to make your app look nicer.

```shell
mkdir -p templates static/css static/img && \
wget -O templates/home.html https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/templates/home.html && \
wget -O static/css/changebank.css https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/static/css/changebank.css && \
wget -O static/img/money.jpg https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/static/img/money.jpg

```

<Aside type="tip">
With the home page and route complete, you can view the home page in your browser at `http://localhost:5000`.
</Aside>

## Authentication
In this section you'll build the integration with FusionAuth, which will allow users to log in to your application.

### Add OAuth Authentication Routes
Next, you'll add a `/login` route that uses authlib to take the user to FusionAuth's OAuth2 `authorize` endpoint,
and a `/callback` route that FusionAuth will redirect the user back to after a successful login.

FusionAuth will include an authorization code in the redirect to `/callback`, and the callback function will
make a server-to-server call to FusionAuth to exchange the authorization code for an access token, refresh token,
and UserInfo object. All of this happens in `oauth.FusionAuth.authorize_access_token()`. This sequence of redirects and
back end calls is known as an OAuth Authorization Code Grant flow.

After your app gets the information back from FusionAuth, you'll write these items to HTTP-only cookies, so that they will
be returned to the Flask application on subsequent requests, but are not readable by code running in the browser.

We also set the UserInfo object in the Flask session, to make it easy to use in rendered templates.

Add the `/login` and `/callback` routes to your server code.

`server.py`
<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/server.py"}
 lang="python"
 tags="loginRoute"/>

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/server.py"}
 lang="python"
 tags="callbackRoute"/>

<Aside type="tip">
Once these steps are done, you should be able to successfully log into your application! Just note that after logging in, you're taking the user to `/account`, which doesn't exist yet.
</Aside>

### Add a Secured Page
Remember that after logging in, the application redirects the user to `/`, which then redirects a logged in user to `/account`. You are going to add that route and page now.

First, create the page template for a logged in user. It's going to show a personalized header and a logout button.

```shell
wget -O templates/account.html https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/templates/account.html
```

Next, create a route to get to that page. This checks if an access token is present. If one isn't, it forces a logout at FusionAuth. If one is, it renders the `/account` page.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/server.py"}
 lang="python"
 tags="accountRoute"/>

<Aside type="tip">
Now when you log in, you should see the `/account` page!
</Aside>

### Add Logout Support
The last step is to implement logout. When you log a user out of an application, you'll take them to FusionAuth's `/oauth2/logout` endpoint. After logging the user out, FusionAuth will redirect the user to your app's `/logout` endpoint, which you'll create now. This endpoint deletes any cookies that your application created, and clears the Flask session.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/server.py"}
 lang="python"
 tags="logoutRoute"/>

<Aside type="tip">
Click the `Logout` button and watch the browser first go to FusionAuth to log out the user, then return to your home page.
