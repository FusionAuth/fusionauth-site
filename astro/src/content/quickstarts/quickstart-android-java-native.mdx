<Intro fulltext="an Android app with Java"
       repositoryUrl="https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-java-android-native"/>


## Prerequisites

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio): The official IDE for Android will help you develop and install necessary tools to set it up.
  - There, you need to [install at least JDK 17](https://developer.android.com/build/jdks).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/site): You'll use it to clone the base repository.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com): The quickest way to stand up FusionAuth. (There are [other ways](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/)).

This app was built on top of [AppAuth](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android), which is an open source client SDK for communicating with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect providers. AppAuth supports Android API 16 (Jellybean) and above.

## General Architecture

<LoginArchitectureWeb />

## Getting Started

In this section, you'll get FusionAuth up and running and use `git` to create a new application.

### Clone the Code

First off, grab the code from the repository and change into that directory.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-java-android-native.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-java-android-native
```

### Run FusionAuth via Docker

<DockerSpinup kickstartUri={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} />

### Set Up A Public URL For FusionAuth

<QuickstartNgrok />

### Configure FusionAuth Instance

Now that you have [exposed your instance](#set-up-a-public-url-for-fusionauth), you need to update the Tenant issuer to make sure it matches the given address.

Log into the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin), browse to `Tenants` in the sidebar, click <IconButton icon="edit" color="blue" /> on the **Default** tenant to edit it. Paste the complete address _(with protocol and domain)_ you copied from ngrok into the `Issuer` field (e.g. `https://6d1e-2804-431-c7c9-739-4703-98a7-4b81-5ba6.ngrok-free.app`). Save the application by clicking the <IconButton icon="save" color="blue" /> icon in the top right corner.

Navigate to `Applications` and click <IconButton icon="edit" color="blue" /> on the **Example Android App** application. Click on the `JWT` tab, change both `Access token signing key` and `Id token signing key` to `Auto generate a new key on save...` and save the application.

<Aside type="note">
You must create new keys after modifying the `Tenant` because the `Issuer` field is embedded in the key.
</Aside>

### Create your Android App

Now you are going to create an Android app. While this section builds a simple Android app on top of the [AppAuth demo app](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android), you can use the same configuration to integrate your existing app with FusionAuth.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/openid-AppAuth-Android.git
cd openid-AppAuth-Android
```

Start by removing some unused files:

```shell
rm app/java/io/fusionauth/app/BrowserSelectionAdapter.java
rm app/res/layout/browser_selector_layout.xml
```

Change the package namespace in `app/build.gradle`. You can replace the entire file with below contents.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-java-android-native/main/complete-application/app/build.gradle"
            lang="groovy"/>

Replace `app/AndroidManifest.xml` as well.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-java-android-native/main/complete-application/app/AndroidManifest.xml"
            lang="xml"/>

## Authentication

We'll use the [AppAuth Library](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android), which simplifies integrating with FusionAuth and creating a secure web application.

### Configure AppAuth

Modify `app/res/raw/auth_config.json` to use the values provisioned by Kickstart. Update the `discovery_uri` value; change `https://[YOUR-NGROK-MAIN-DOMAIN]` to the URL you wrote when [exposing your instance](#set-up-a-public-url-for-fusionauth).

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-java-android-native/main/complete-application/app/res/raw/auth_config.json"
            lang="json"/>

### Change Activities

An [Activity](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/intro-activities) is a screen for your app, combining the User Interface as well as the logic to handle it. Start by changing the login activity layout at `app/res/layout/activity_login.xml`. Replace it with the below XML.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-java-android-native/main/complete-application/app/res/layout/activity_login.xml"
            lang="xml"/>

Now modify login activity logic by replacing `app/java/io/fusionauth/app/LoginActivity.java` with this code.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-java-android-native/main/complete-application/app/java/io/fusionauth/app/LoginActivity.java"
            lang="java"/>

Update the main screen layout in the file `app/res/layout/activity_token.xml`.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-java-android-native/main/complete-application/app/res/layout/activity_token.xml"
            lang="xml"/>

And finally, change the main screen logic by replacing the content of `app/java/io/fusionauth/app/TokenActivity.java` with the below.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-java-android-native/main/complete-application/app/java/io/fusionauth/app/TokenActivity.java"
            lang="java"/>

## App Customization

In this section, you'll update the look and feel of your native application to match the ChangeBank banking styling.

### Change Colors and Strings

Change the application colors in `app/res/values/colors.xml` to the ones used by Changebank.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-java-android-native/main/complete-application/app/res/values/colors.xml"
            lang="xml"/>

Modify strings shown in the user interface by updating `app/res/values/strings.xml`.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-java-android-native/main/complete-application/app/res/values/strings.xml"
            lang="xml"/>

### Add Styling

Now, add image assets to make this look like a real application with the following shell commands.

```shell
curl -o app/res/drawable/changebank.png https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-java-android-native/main/complete-application/app/res/drawable/changebank.png
curl -o app/res/mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher.png https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-java-android-native/main/complete-application/app/res/mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher.png
curl -o app/res/mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher.png https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-java-android-native/main/complete-application/app/res/mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher.png
curl -o app/res/mipmap-mdpi/ic_launcher.png https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-java-android-native/main/complete-application/app/res/mipmap-mdpi/ic_launcher.png
curl -o app/res/mipmap-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-java-android-native/main/complete-application/app/res/mipmap-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png
curl -o app/res/mipmap-xxhdpi/ic_launcher.png https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-java-android-native/main/complete-application/app/res/mipmap-xxhdpi/ic_launcher.png
curl -o app/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher.png https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-java-android-native/main/complete-application/app/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher.png
```

Once you've created these files, you can test the application out.

## Run the App

You can either [connect a hardware device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device) or create an Android Virtual Device to run the [Android Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator)

[Build and run the app](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/) following Android Studio guidelines.

</NextSteps>


## Troubleshooting

* I can't log in

Make sure you have the right values at `app/res/raw/auth_config.json`. Double-check the `Issuer` in the **Tenant** to make sure it matches the public URL that FusionAuth is running at.
