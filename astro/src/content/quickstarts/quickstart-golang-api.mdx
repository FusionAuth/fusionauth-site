       api/>

## Prerequisites

- [Go](https://go.dev/): This quickstart was built using Golang 1.21.0. This example may work on different versions of Golang, but it has not been tested.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com): The quickest way to stand up FusionAuth. Ensure you also have [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.
- (Alternatively, you can [Install FusionAuth Manually](/docs/get-started/download-and-install)).

## General Architecture

<LoginArchitectureApi />

## Getting Started

In this section, you’ll get FusionAuth up and running and create a resource server which will serve the API.

### Clone The Code

First off, grab the code from the repository and change into that directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-golang-api.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-golang-api
```

### Run FusionAuth Via Docker

<DockerSpinup kickstartUri={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} api />

## Create Your Golang Resource Server Application

Now you are going to create a Golang API application. While this section builds a simple API, you can use the same configuration to integrate an existing API with FusionAuth.

We are going to be building an API backend for a banking application called ChangeBank. This API will have two endpoints:
- `make-change`: This endpoint will allow you to call GET with a `total` amount and receive a response indicating how many nickels and pennies are needed to make change. Valid roles are `customer` and `teller`.
- `panic`: Tellers may call this endpoint to call the police in case of an incident. The only valid role is `teller`.

Both endpoints will be protected such that a valid JSON web token (JWT) will be required in the `Authorization` header in order to be accessed. Additionally, the JWT must have a `roles` claim containing the appropriate role to use the endpoint.

<Aside type="note">
If you simply want to run the application , there is a completed version in the 'complete-application' directory. You can use the following commands to get it up and running if you do not want to create your own.

```shell
cd complete-application
go get
go run main.go
```

You can then follow the instructions in the Run the API section started at Get a Token.
</Aside>

To create the application from scratch, make a directory for this API.

```
mkdir your-application && cd your-application
```

### Initialize The Application

Initialize the Golang application using the following:

```
go mod init your-application
```

### Write Golang Code

<Aside type="note">
This tutorial puts all these classes in the same package for simplicity, but for a production application, you'd separate these out.
</Aside>

Now you are going to write some Golang code. You need to create a file called `main.go`. You'll be building it step by step, adding code each step.

Here you will add the package clause and import declarations below:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/main.go"} tags="package-imports"
  lang="go"/>

Next, you will need to add a couple of structures to help manage the data for making change.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/main.go"} tags="define-struct"
  lang="go"/>

You will also need to declare a variable and assign the value of the public key for the application. The value for this key will be set later in the application. Declare this variable below the import declarations.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/main.go"} tags="verify-key"
  lang="go"/>

### Add Handlers and Functions

Create the main function for the application.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/main.go"} tags="main"
  lang="go"/>

Next, you are going to add some handlers. This tells the application how to handle specific requests. Notice the `isAuthorized` function wrapping around the `panic` and `makeChange` functions. We will implement this function later and it is what will validate the token and verify the roles. This function will also stand up the HTTP listener on port `9001`.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/main.go"} tags="handlers"
  lang="go"/>

You will write two functions that will return values when users access them. These functions are called by the handlers. One is the `panic` which returns a message when a successful `POST` call is made to `/panic`. This will also display a message if the request is not made through a `POST`. This API has no relation to the `panic` method in go, it's for a teller panicking when ChangeBank is being robbed.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/main.go"} tags="panic-function"
  lang="go"/>

Next you need a function to show the breakdown from making change for a given dollar amount. This function will get the `total` value from the query string. If the `total` cannot be cast to a `float64`, the function will return a message stating that. If the `total` is a valid number, the function will return the description of the change.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/main.go"} tags="make-change-function"
  lang="go"/>

### Add Security

Now you need to implement the `isAuthorized` function used by the handlers. Now, you'll protect your endpoints based on the `roles` encoded in the JWT you receive from FusionAuth. The decoded payload of a JWT for a `teller` might look like this:

```json
{
  "aud": "e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e",
  "exp": 1689289585,
  "iat": 1689285985,
  "iss": "http://localhost:9011",
  "sub": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-111111111111",
  "jti": "ebaa4184-2320-47dd-925b-2e18756c635f",
  "authenticationType": "PASSWORD",
  "email": "teller@example.com",
  "email_verified": true,
  "applicationId": "e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e",
  "roles": [
    "teller"
  ],
  "auth_time": 1689285985,
  "tid": "d7d09513-a3f5-401c-9685-34ab6c552453"
}
```

You need to validate the token and make sure the user has the appropriate role to access the API. You can do so by adding the following code:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/main.go"} tags="authorization"
  lang="go"/>

There is a lot of code in this function. Let's break it down:
- First you validate some claims. Notice the `checkAudience` that makes sure the token is intended for this application and `checkIss` to make sure the issuer is as expected.
- `SetPublicKey`, which is a function we will create later, retrieves the public key for the JWT.
- After the key has been set, the `golang-jwt/jwt` will validate the signature and expiration date.
- Once the token is validated, you will need to take a look at the roles.
- The code will look to see which page is being called and then create an array for the roles that are valid for that request in `validRoles`.
     - The `containsRole` function will be created as well and that creates an array with the intersection of roles that are allowed and roles that are required. If the length of that intersection is greater than 1 then the user has the proper role.
- Once the roles have been validated, then the endpoint is served.

Now, you will add the code to set the public key. This function will accept the key Id from the token and call the authorization server to get the public key with that key Id and put it in the proper format to be used.

<Aside type="note">
Different tokens can be signed with different keys. In this example there is only one key used. If the key is already set, the application will not attempt to set it again. In a production environment you could store this key on the server or set it once on initialization. If your API serves several applications, you will need to get the correct public key for each application if the signing keys are different between applications. It should also be noted that you could use [JWKS](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/endpoints#json-web-key-set-jwks), a standard for retrieving public keys, but this example uses FusionAuth's proprietary APIs.
</Aside>

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/main.go"} tags="set-public-key"
  lang="go"/>

Then add the code to compare the required roles to the user's roles based on the token.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/main.go"} tags="contains-role"
  lang="go"/>

Finally you will add two helper functions. `GetFunctionName` will return the name of the function being called by the endpoint. `SetWriterReturn` will format the response properly.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/main.go"} tags="helper"
  lang="go"/>

That is all the code for the sample application. Save the `main.go` file.

## Run the API

Start the API resource server by running:

In a command shell window, navigate to the root directory of your API.

```shell
cd your-application
go get
go run main.go
```

### Get a Token

There are [several ways to acquire a token](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/) in FusionAuth, but for this example you will use the [Login API](/docs/apis/login) to keep things simple.

First let's try the requests as the `teller@example.com` user. Based on the configuration this user has the `teller` role and should be able to use both `/make-change` and `/panic`.

1. Acquire an access token for `teller@example.com` by making the following request

```shell
curl --location 'http://localhost:9011/api/login' \
--header 'Authorization: this_really_should_be_a_long_random_alphanumeric_value_but_this_still_works' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "loginId": "teller@example.com",
  "password": "password",
  "applicationId": "e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e"
}'
```
Copy the `token` from the response, which should look like this:

```json
{
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6InVOYl9iQzFySHZZTnZMc285VzRkOEprZkxLWSJ9.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.WLzI9hSsCDn3ZoHKA9gaifkd6ASjT03JUmROGFZaezz9xfVbO3quJXEpUpI3poLozYxVcj2hrxKpNT9b7Sp16CUahev5tM0-4_FaYlmUEoMZBKo2JRSH8hg-qVDvnpeu8nL6FXxJII0IK4FNVwrQVFmAz99ZCf7m5xruQSziXPrfDYSU-3OZJ3SRuvD8bMopSiyRvZLx6YjWfBsvGSmMXeh_8vHG5fVkq5w1IkaDdugHnivtJIivHuCfl38kQBgw9rAqJLJoKRHHW0Ha7vHIcS6OCWWMDIIVspLyQNcLC16pL9Nss_5v9HMofow1OvQ9sUSMrbbkipjKq2peSjG7qA",
    "tokenExpirationInstant": 1689353059670,
    "user": {
        ...
    }
}
```

### Make the Request

<Aside type="note">
The code is set up to extract the token from either a cookie or the `Authorization` header so depending on your preference you can replace `--cookie 'app.at=<your_token>'` with `--header 'Authorization: Bearer <your_token>'` when making requests to the API.

If you use a cookie, make sure you store it in a secure, HttpOnly cookie to avoid exfiltration attacks. See [Storing OAuth Tokens](/articles/oauth/oauth-token-storage) for more information.
</Aside>

Make a request to `/make-change` with a query parameter `total=1.02`. Use the `token` as the `app.at` cookie.
Use the `token` as a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header. Make a request to `/make-change` with a query parameter `total=5.12`.

```shell
curl 'http://localhost:9001/make-change?total=1.02' --cookie 'app.at=<your_token>' 
```

The response should look similar to below, however it has been formatted here for readability:

```json
{
  "Message": "We can make change using 20 quarters 1 dimes 0 nickels 2 pennies",
  "Change": [
    {
      "Denomination": "quarters",
      "Count": 20
    },
    {
      "Denomination": "dimes",
      "Count": 1
    },
    {
      "Denomination": "nickels",
      "Count": 0
    },
    {
      "Denomination": "pennies",
      "Count": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

You were authorized, success! You can try making the request without the `Authorization` header or with a different string rather than a valid token, and see that you are denied access.

Next call the `/panic` endpoint because you are in trouble!

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:9001/panic' \
--cookie 'app.at=<your_token>'
```

This is a `POST` not a get because you want all your emergency calls to be non-idempotent.

Your response should look like this:

```json
{"message":"We've called the police!"}
```

Nice, help is on the way!

Now let's try as `customer@example.com` who has the role `customer`. Acquire a token for `customer@example.com`.

```shell
curl --location 'http://localhost:9011/api/login' \
--header 'Authorization: this_really_should_be_a_long_random_alphanumeric_value_but_this_still_works' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "loginId": "customer@example.com",
  "password": "password",
  "applicationId": "e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e"
}'
```

Your response should look like this:

```json
{
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6InVOYl9iQzFySHZZTnZMc285VzRkOEprZkxLWSJ9.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.T1bELQ6a_ItOS0_YYpvqhIVknVMNeamcoC7BWnPjg2lgA9XpCmFA2mVnycoeuz-mSOHbp2cCoauP5opxehBR2lCn4Sz0If6PqgJgXKEpxh5pAxCPt91UyfjH8hGDqE3rDh7E4Hqn7mb-dFFwdfX7CMdKvC3dppMbXAGCZTl0LizApw5KIG9Wmt670339pSf5lzD38P9WAG5Wr7fAmVrIJPVu6yv2FoR-pMYD2lnAF63HWKknrWB-khmhr9ZKRLXKhP1UK-ThY1FSnmpp8eNblsBqCxf6WaYxYkdp5_F2e56M4sQwHzrg4P9tZGVCmMri4dShF3Ck7OGa7hel-iIPew",
    "tokenExpirationInstant": 1689354123118,
    "user": {
        ...
    }
}
```

Now use that token to call `/make-change` with a query parameter `total=3.24`

```shell
curl --location 'http://localhost:9001/make-change?total=3.24' \
--cookie 'app.at=<your_token>'
```

The response should look similar to below, however it has been formatted here for readability:

```json
{
  "Message": "We can make change using 12 quarters 2 dimes 0 nickels 4 pennies",
  "Change": [
    {
      "Denomination": "quarters",
      "Count": 12
    },
    {
      "Denomination": "dimes",
      "Count": 2
    },
    {
      "Denomination": "nickels",
      "Count": 0
    },
    {
      "Denomination": "pennies",
      "Count": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

So far so good. Now let's try to call the `/panic` endpoint. (We're adding the `-i` flag to see the headers of the response)

```shell
curl -i --request POST 'http://localhost:9001/panic' \
--cookie 'app.at=<your_token>'
```

Your should receive a `401 Unauthorized` response with the following message:

```json
{"message":"Proper role not found for user"}
```

Looks like this user does not have access to this function. Enjoy your secured resource server!

## Next Steps

<NextStepsApi />

## Troubleshooting

* I get `This site can’t be reached localhost refused to connect.` when I call the Login API.

Ensure FusionAuth is running in the Docker container. You should be able to login as the admin user, `admin@example.com` with a password of `password` at [http://localhost:9011/admin](http://localhost:9011/admin).

* The `/panic` endpoint doesn't work when I call it.

Make sure you are making a `POST` call and using a token with the `teller` role.

* I get an error message: `curl: (52) Empty reply from server`

Make sure you are using the correct `Authorization` header. If you don't have `Bearer ` in front of your token, you will see this error message.

* I get a message `invalid signing method`.

Make sure you are providing the application Id on the login request. This ensures that the JWT is signed with the correct key.


* It still doesn't work

You can always pull down a complete running application and compare what's different.
