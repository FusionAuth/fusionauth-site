This quickstart adds login and a protected page to a React web app using a preconfigured, local version of FusionAuth in the following steps:

1. Create a new React app.
1. Customize the app with home and account pages.
1. Add login to protect the account page.
1. Add a button to the account page to fetch the user's information.

## Prerequisites

This Quickstart requires:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) 22 or later
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) 23 or later
* On macOS and Windows, one of the following container management tools:
  * [OrbStack](https://docs.orbstack.dev/quick-start) (to use Orbstack for `docker compose` commands after install, run `docker context use orbstack` )
  * [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation) (in the commands below, replace `docker` with `podman`)
  * [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

Be sure to open your container management tool to configure and install any dependencies needed by that tool, including Rosetta and Developer Tools on macOS.

## Install and Run FusionAuth

To begin, clone the [GitHub repository for this Quickstart](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-react) to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-react.git
```

The repository contains:

* `fusionauth-backend`, a preconfigured version of FusionAuth
* `react-frontend-steps`, a runnable version of each development step of the React application

In a terminal, navigate to `fusionauth-quickstart-react/fusionauth-backend`. To start a local instance of FusionAuth, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

<Aside type="note">
During the Docker compose process, the included `/fusionauth-quickstart-react/kickstart/kickstart.json` file uses the FusionAuth API to:

* Generate an API key
* Configure CORS (<Breadcrumb>Settings -> System -> CORS</Breadcrumb>)
* Create your app ("Quick Start App") with appropriate settings and redirect URIs (<Breadcrumb>Applications -> Edit Application</Breadcrumb>)
* Create an admin user (admin@example.com) and register the user with your app (<Breadcrumb>Users</Breadcrumb>)
* Create a user (richard@example.com) and register the user with your app
* Create a custom theme ("Quick Start Theme") using `fusionauth-quickstart-react/kickstart/css/styles.css` and apply it to your default tenant (<Breadcrumb>Customizations -> Themes</Breadcrumb>)
</Aside>

Once Docker compose completes, open a browser window and navigate to the admin UI of your FusionAuth instance at [http://localhost:9011/admin](http://localhost:9011/admin). Use the following admin account credentials to log in:

* Username: `admin@example.com`
* Password: `password`

After authenticating, you should see the FusionAuth admin UI, which shows information about active users, logins, registrations, and more:

## Create the React app

First, create a new TypeScript React app with Vite: 

1. To generate a new React app in a folder called `app-quickstart-react`, open a terminal window and run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest app-quickstart-react -- --template react-ts
   ```

   Select "Yes" to install necessary Vite packages if prompted. Then select "No" for the following options:

   * Use rolldown-vite (Experimental)? **No**  
   * Install with npm and start now? **No**

1. Navigate into the app folder and install the project dependencies with the following commands:

   ```bash
   cd app-quickstart-react
   ```

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ```bash
   npm install react-router-dom
   ```

1. Delete the file `app-quickstart-react/src/App.tsx` as you'll add routing to display the app pages:

   ```bash
   rm -rf src/App.tsx
   ```

## Customize the React app

### Update the main app component

Replace the contents of `src/main.tsx` with the following code:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-react/main/react-frontend-steps/1-customized/src/main.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

This is the main app component for your React app. The last code block inserts the app into the root DOM element.

### Create the homepage

Create the file `src/home.tsx` for the public homepage and add the following code:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-react/main/react-frontend-steps/1-customized/src/home.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

The click handler function for the login button redirects the user to the account page. You'll replace this function when you add authentication.

### Create the account page

Create the file `src/account.tsx` for the account page and add the following code:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-react/main/react-frontend-steps/1-customized/src/account.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

The click handler function for the logout button redirects to the home page. You'll replace this function when you add authentication.

### Update the stylesheet

Replace the contents of the `src/App.css` stylesheet with the following CSS:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-react/main/react-frontend-steps/1-customized/src/App.css" lang="css"/>

### Update index.html

In the root directory, replace the contents of `index.html` with the following code:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-react/main/react-frontend-steps/1-customized/index.html" lang="html"/>

This page loads the CSS in the head component. The body loads `main.tsx`, the main React container.

### Run the React app

Run your app on port `3000`:

1. In `package.json`, update the `dev` script to use port `3000`:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
       "dev": "vite --port 3000",
   }
   ```

1. From the React app directory, run the following command to start the Vite web server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

1. To view your app, open a web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Add FusionAuth for authentication

In this section, you protect the account page with a login.

### Configure and enable FusionAuth

1. From the React app directory (`app-quickstart-react`), run the following command to install the FusionAuth React SDK:

   ```bash
   npm install @fusionauth/react-sdk@~2.5.1
   ```

1. Open `src/main.tsx` and replace the file contents with the following code to:

   * import functions and types from the FusionAuth React SDK
   * configure and add the FusionAuth provider

   <RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-react/main/react-frontend-steps/2-fusionauth-added/src/main.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

<Aside type="note">
This FusionAuth configuration specifies the following values:

* `redirectUri`: URI to open after a successful login.  
* `postLogoutRedirectUri`: URI to open after logout.  
* `shouldAutoRefresh`: Set to automatically renew the access token.  
* `shouldAutoFetchUserInfo`: Return data for the user as part of a successful login.  
* `scope`: OAuth 2.0 permissions for the access token.  
* `clientId`: ID of the application in the FusionAuth instance.  
* `serverUrl`: Base URL for the FusionAuth authorization server.  
* `onRedirect`: Callback that executes when a redirect occurs.
</Aside>

### Add login and logout to homepage

Open `src/home.tsx` and replace the file contents with the following code to:

* import functions and types from the FusionAuth React SDK
* update `Home()` to route an authenticated user to the account page after they authenticate
* update the login button handler to save `justLoggedIn` until the login redirect is complete, then call `startLogin()`
* add logic to the title bar to show a authenticated user’s email and a logout button, otherwise a login button

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-react/main/react-frontend-steps/2-fusionauth-added/src/home.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

### Add logout to account page

Open `src/account.tsx` and replace the file contents with the following code to:

* import functions and types from the FusionAuth React SDK
* update `Account()` to show the account page only to a logged-in user
* update the account page to display the user's email in the title bar
* update the logout button click handler to start the logout process using the FusionAuth React SDK `startLogout()` method

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-react/main/react-frontend-steps/2-fusionauth-added/src/account.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

### Test authentication

1. Open a private browser window.

1. Navigate to the React app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

   ![The landing page of the React app.](/img/quickstarts/react/landing-page.png)

1. Click the login button. Your browser should redirect to FusionAuth at `http://localhost:9011`.
   
   ![The fusionauth login screen.](/img/quickstarts/react/login-fusionauth.png)

1. Authenticate with the credentials for the user created in the `fusionauth-quickstart-react/kickstart/kickstart.json` file:

   * Username: `richard@example.com`  
   * Password: `password`

FusionAuth validates the credentials, then redirects back to the `redirectUri` set in `src/main.tsx`. The home page checks whether the user is logged in. If they are, the app navigates to the account page.

## Fetch user data

In this section you use the [FusionAuth API](/docs/apis/hosted-backend#me) to refresh and display detailed user data.

### Call the FusionAuth API

1. Open `src/account.tsx` and replace the file contents with the following code to:

   * add `useState` to the React import
   * update the `Account()` function to get user data from FusionAuth and save it in `newUserInfo`
   * update `centerContainer` to display current user data from `newUserInfo`
   * update the button to fetch user data from `getUserInfo()`

   <RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-react/main/react-frontend-steps/3-fetch-user-data/src/account.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

<Aside type="note">
`getUserInfo()` sets `newUserInfo` to the result of an asynchronous call to the [`/me` endpoint](/docs/apis/hosted-backend#me). The API call uses `credentials: include` to authorize the API call with a cookie set by FusionAuth during login.
</Aside>

### Test user data functionality

1. Browse to the account page at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

   ![The home page, now ready to show user data.](/img/quickstarts/react/home-with-data-not-shown.png)

1. Click the "Show your info" button to fetch and display the latest user data.
