While this article uses {frontmatter.framework}, the {frontmatter.language} OAuth2 library can also be used in your preferred framework, such as Rocket or Axum.

## Prerequisites

For this quickstart, you'll need:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com) version 20 or later, which is the quickest way to start FusionAuth. (There are [other ways](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/).)
* [{frontmatter.language}](https://rustup.rs/#) and Cargo version 1.7 or later.
* You may also need to install `pkg-config` and `libssl-dev` if they are not already installed on your system.

## General Architecture

<LoginArchitectureWeb />

## Getting Started

Start with getting FusionAuth up and running and creating a new {frontmatter.framework} application.

### Clone The Code

First, grab the code from the repository and change to that folder.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-rust-actix-web.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-rust-actix-web
mkdir your-application
```

All shell commands in this guide can be entered in a terminal in this folder. On Windows, you need to replace forward slashes with backslashes in paths.

All the files you'll create in this guide already exist in the `complete-application` subfolder, if you prefer to copy them to `your-application`.

### Run FusionAuth Via Docker

<DockerSpinup kickstartUri={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} />

### The Basic {frontmatter.framework} Application

While this guide builds a new {frontmatter.framework} project, you can use the same method to integrate your existing project with FusionAuth.


<Aside type="note">
  If you only want to run the application and not create your own, there is a completed version in the `complete-application` directory. You can use the following commands to get it up and running.

  ```shell
  cd complete-application
  cargo run
  ```

  View the application at http://localhost:9012.
</Aside>

From here on, you'll work in the `your-application` directory. Install the dependencies for the web server with the code below.

```bash
cd your-application
cargo init
cargo add actix-web@4 
cargo add actix-files@0.6.2 
cargo add actix-session@0.8.0 --features cookie-session 
cargo add dotenv@0.15.0 
cargo add handlebars@4.5 --features dir_source 
cargo add oauth2@4.4.2 
cargo add reqwest@0.11 --features json
cargo add serde@1.0 --features derive
```

Add the following code to your `src/main.rs` file.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/src/main.rs"}
  lang="rust" />

The `main` function configures the web server, adds routes to it, and starts it. The function also:

- Uses `dotenv` to allow you to call any values from the `.env` file later in the application.
- Uses private same-site cookies to store the user's email when logged in. {frontmatter.framework} does not provide an anti-CSRF token as they [believe same-site cookies render it unnecessary](https://github.com/actix/actix-web/issues/147).
- Adds routes from the main file to the server, and some authentication routes, which you'll add in the next section.
- Enables the Handlebars library to provide HTML templates.

The remainder of this main file is three routes: index, account, and change. They each check if the user's email is in the HTTP request cookie (meaning the user is logged in), and display an HTML template. The account and change routes send the user's email to the template.

The change route is more complicated. It has two versions: one for GET and one for POST. The POST version checks the request's form to extract a dollar amount, then calls `calculate_change` to convert the dollars to nickels and pennies, and returns them in the state to the Handlebars template.

## Authentication

Authentication in {frontmatter.language} is managed by [OAuth2](https://docs.rs/oauth2/latest/oauth2/).

Create the file `.env` in the `your-application` directory and insert the following lines.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/.env"}/>

This tells {frontmatter.framework} where to find and connect to FusionAuth.

Authentication is handled by `src/auth.rs`. Create that file now and insert the following code.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/src/auth.rs"}
  lang="rust" />

This code has three routes: `login`, `logout`, and `callback`.

- `logout` clears the user's session and returns them to the home page.
- `login` uses `get_oauth_client` to read your variables from the `.env` file and get a new client that constructs a URL to call FusionAuth, then redirects the user to that URL.
- `callback` does most of the work. The user is returned to `callback` after logging in with FusionAuth. The function checks that the PKCE challenge is correct, retrieves the access token, and makes a final call to FusionAuth to get the user's email, which it stores in the session. Now the application considers the user logged in.

{frontmatter.framework} automatically links the user's session to their browser by returning a cookie for the site, which is then included in every subsequent request.

Now that `callback` has set a cookie, you can see how authentication on the other pages is tested. The application:

- Sends the user to the account page if they already have a login cookie on the home page.
- Sends the user to the home page if they are not logged in on the account page.

## Customization

With authentication done, the last task is to create example pages that a user can browse.

### CSS And HTML

Create a `static` directory within `your-application` directory.

```shell
mkdir static
```

Copy images from the example app.

```shell
cp ../complete-application/static/money.jpg static/money.jpg
cp ../complete-application/static/changebank.svg static/changebank.svg
```

Create a stylesheet file `static/changebank.css` and add the following code to it.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/static/changebank.css"}
  lang="css"/>

Next, create a `templates` directory within `your-application`. Create three pages inside the `templates` directory. First create the home page, `index.html`, and paste the following code into it.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/templates/index.html"}
  lang="html"/>

The index page contains nothing to note except a link to the login page `<a href="/login">`.

Next, create an `account.html` page and paste the following code into it.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/templates/account.html"}
  lang="html"/>

The account page displays the user's email from FusionAuth with `<p class="header-email">{{email}}</p>`.

The account page is only visible to logged in users. If a session email is not found, the user is redirected to login.

Finally, create a `change.html` page and paste the following code into it.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/templates/change.html"}
  lang="html"/>

The HTML at the bottom of the file displays a blank form when the page first loads (GET) or the result of the calculation when returning (POST).

## Run The Application

Run your application.

```bash
cargo run
```

Browse to the app at http://localhost:9012. Log in using <code><RemoteValue url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} selector="$.variables.userEmail" /></code> and <code><RemoteValue url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} selector="$.variables.userPassword" /></code>. The change page allows you to enter a number. If you don't log in, you won't be able to access the change or account pages.

## Next Steps

<NextSteps />

### {frontmatter.language} Authentication

- [Rust OAuth provider](https://docs.rs/oauth2/latest/oauth2/)
- [Actix](https://actix.rs/)

## Troubleshooting

- I get "This site can’t be reached localhost refused to connect" when I click the login button.

Ensure FusionAuth is running in the Docker container. You should be able to log in as the admin user <code><RemoteValue url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} selector="$.variables.adminEmail" /></code> with the password <code><RemoteValue url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} selector="$.variables.adminPassword" /></code> at [http://localhost:9011/admin](http://localhost:9011/admin).

- It still doesn't work.

You can always pull down a complete running application and compare what's different.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-rust-actix-web.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-rust-actix-web
docker compose up
cd complete-application
cargo run
```

Browse to the app at http://localhost:9012.
