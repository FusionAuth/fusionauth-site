You've now taken an application and layered on authentication with FusionAuth. A user who is registered for the application can log in, view private data, and log out.

Congrats!

Here are typical next steps.

* [setting up self-service registration](/docs/lifecycle/register-users/basic-registration-forms) so you don't need to add every user via the admin UI
* configuring the [theme](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/overview) to make the FusionAuth pages look like your application
* looking at [tutorials in other programming languages](/docs/v1/tech/tutorials/)
* read about [FusionAuth core concepts like Tenants and Roles](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/)
* researching [what kind of login workflow](/learn/expert-advice/authentication/login-authentication-workflows) fits your needs

Of course, there are plenty of [other docs](/docs/v1/tech/), covering a variety of topics. Here are some popular ones.

* [Customizing JWTs](/docs/v1/tech/lambdas/jwt-populate)
* [Sending and customizing emails](/docs/customize/email-and-messages/overview)
* [Logging in with OIDC, SAML and social login providers like Google](/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers/)
* [Setting Up MFA/Two-Factor](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/multi-factor-authentication)
* [Supported OAuth grants](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/overview)
* [Single sign-on aka SSO](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/single-sign-on)
* [Managing user data with the User API](/docs/apis/users)
* [Premium features](/docs/v1/tech/premium-features/)
