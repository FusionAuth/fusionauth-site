## General Architecture

<LoginArchitectureWeb/>

## Getting Started

In this section, you'll get FusionAuth up and running and use `git` to create a new application.

### Clone the Code

First off, grab the code from the repository and change into that directory.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-swift-ios-native.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-swift-ios-native
```

### Run FusionAuth via Docker

<DockerSpinup kickstartUri={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} />

### Create your iOS App

If you want to skip the step by step creation of the iOS App open the `./complete-application/` folder in Xcode.

Open Xcode and click <Breadcrumb>File -> New Project</Breadcrumb>. Choose <InlineUIElement>iOS</InlineUIElement> as the platform, and <InlineUIElement>App</InlineUIElement> as the application type. Click <InlineUIElement>Next</InlineUIElement>.

You can set <InlineField>Product Name</InlineField> to `Quickstart`, <InlineField>Organization Identifier</InlineField> to `io.fusionauth` and click <InlineUIElement>Next</InlineUIElement> and <InlineUIElement>Create</InlineUIElement> your project in a folder as per your preference.

Wait until Xcode has finished creating and indexing the project.

Now you have a standard "Hello World" app. You can run it in the simulator by clicking the play button in the top left corner of Xcode or selecting <Breadcrumb>Product -> Run</Breadcrumb> from the menu bar.

## Authentication

We'll use the [FusionAuth iOS SDK](/docs/sdks/ios-sdk), which simplifies integrating with FusionAuth and creating a secure web application.

Add the [FusionAuth Swift SDK as a dependency](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-swift-sdk) to your project by [Add Package Dependencies..](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-package-dependencies-to-your-app) with the latest version. Select the Quickstart Application as a target and click `Add Package`.

### Configure FusionAuth

First, create a new property list file to store the configuration values. Select <Breadcrumb>File -> New -> File from Template</Breadcrumb> from the menu bar. Select <InlineUIElement>Property List</InlineUIElement> as the template. Click <InlineUIElement>Next</InlineUIElement>. Set the name of the file to `FusionAuth.plist`. Make sure that the `Quickstart` subfolder is selected. Click <InlineUIElement>Create</InlineUIElement>.

Right-click on the `Quickstart/FusionAuth.plist` file in the project navigator and select <InlineUIElement>Open As -> Source Code</InlineUIElement>. Copy and paste the following code into the file to use the values provisioned by Kickstart.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/Quickstart/FusionAuth.plist"} lang="xml"/>

In this example we are using a `ObservableObject` to store and listen to changes in the `FusionAuthState` object. This object will be used to determine which view to display based on the user's authentication state.

Create a new Swift file to store the `FusionAuthState` object. Select <Breadcrumb>File -> New -> File from Template</Breadcrumb> from the menu bar. Select <InlineUIElement>Swift File</InlineUIElement> as the template. Click <InlineUIElement>Next</InlineUIElement>. Set the name of the file to `FusionAuthStateObject.swift`. Click <InlineUIElement>Create</InlineUIElement>.

Replace the contents of the `Quickstart/FusionAuthStateObject.swift` file with the following code.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/Quickstart/FusionAuthStateObject.swift"} lang="swift"/>

Finally, update the quickstart app `Quickstart/QuickstartApp.swift` to use the `AuthorizationManager` and register `FusionAuthStateObject` as an environment object.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/Quickstart/QuickstartApp.swift"} lang="swift"/>

### Change Views

A [View](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/views_and_controls) and controls are the visual building blocks of your app’s user interface. Use them to draw and organize your app’s content onscreen.

Start by creating login view by selecting <Breadcrumb>File -> New -> File from Template</Breadcrumb> from the menu bar. Select <InlineUIElement>SwiftUI View</InlineUIElement> as the template. Click <InlineUIElement>Next</InlineUIElement>. Set the name of the file to `LoginView.swift`. Click <InlineUIElement>Create</InlineUIElement>. Replace the contents of the `Quickstart/LoginView.swift` file with the following code.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/Quickstart/LoginView.swift"} lang="swift"/>

The `LoginView` view is displayed when the user is not logged in and contains a button that initiates the login flow. The `login` method is called when the login button is pressed.

Next, create the logged in view `Quickstart/LoggedInView.swift` like previously done for the `LoginView.swift`.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/Quickstart/LoggedInView.swift"} lang="swift"/>

Next, we update the `Quickstart/ContentView.swift` view to display the login screen if the user is not logged in, or the main app screens if the user is logged in. The `UserAuth` object is accessed via the `@EnvironmentObject` property wrapper, and the `isLoggedIn` property is used to determine which view to display.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/Quickstart/ContentView.swift"} lang="swift"/>

Create the main view after a successful login in the file `Quickstart/HomeView.swift`.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/Quickstart/HomeView.swift"} lang="swift"/>

The `HomeView` view is displayed when the user is logged in. It greets the user by their name, email or nick retrieved from FusionAuth, and contains buttons that initiates the refresh token and logout flow. The `UserInfo` state object is updated with the user's information when the view is loaded, and the `refreshToken` and `logout` methods are called when the corresponding buttons are pressed.

### Add The Make Change View

ChangeBank's main business is to convert your notes to coins. The `MakeChangeView` view is available when the user is logged in. It takes an amount in dollars and returns the equivalent amount in nickels and pennies.

Create the `Quickstart/MakeChangeView.swift` file.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/Quickstart/MakeChangeView.swift"} lang="swift"/>

## App Customization

In this section, you'll update the look and feel of your native application to match the ChangeBank banking styling.

### Change Colors and Styles

Add the colors and styles in the file `Quickstart/Styles.swift`.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/Quickstart/Styles.swift"} lang="swift"/>

### Add Images

Now, add image assets to make this look like a real application with the following shell commands, run in the root of your project.

```shell
curl --create-dirs -o Quickstart/Assets.xcassets/AccentColor.colorset/Contents.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-swift-ios-native/refs/heads/main/complete-application/Quickstart/Assets.xcassets/AccentColor.colorset/Contents.json
curl --create-dirs -o Quickstart/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/Contents.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-swift-ios-native/refs/heads/main/complete-application/Quickstart/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/Contents.json
curl --create-dirs -o Quickstart/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/fa_icon.png https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-swift-ios-native/refs/heads/main/complete-application/Quickstart/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/fa_icon.png
curl --create-dirs -o Quickstart/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/fa_icon_dark.png https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-swift-ios-native/refs/heads/main/complete-application/Quickstart/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/fa_icon_dark.png
curl --create-dirs -o Quickstart/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/fa_icon_tinted.png https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-swift-ios-native/refs/heads/main/complete-application/Quickstart/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/fa_icon_tinted.png
curl --create-dirs -o Quickstart/Assets.xcassets/changebank.imageset/Contents.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-swift-ios-native/refs/heads/main/complete-application/Quickstart/Assets.xcassets/changebank.imageset/Contents.json
curl --create-dirs -o Quickstart/Assets.xcassets/changebank.imageset/Image.png https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-swift-ios-native/refs/heads/main/complete-application/Quickstart/Assets.xcassets/changebank.imageset/Image.png
```

Once you've created these files, you can test the application out.

## Run the App

The quickstart app is configured to run on an [iOS Simulator or iOS device.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/running-your-app-in-simulator-or-on-a-device)

### Running The App On A Simulator

To run the app in the simulator, click the play button in the top-left corner of Xcode or select <Breadcrumb>Product -> Run</Breadcrumb> from the menu bar. The app will be built and run in the simulator.

Click <InlineUIElement>Login</InlineUIElement>. You should see a system notification, and then be redirected to FusionAuth in a popup browser. Log in with the username `richard@example.com` and the password `password`. You should see the home screen displaying your name, your balance, and a logout button.

At the bottom of the screen, you'll see a tab bar with two tabs. Click the <Breadcrumb>Make Change</Breadcrumb> tab. Enter an amount in dollars, and click <InlineUIElement>Make Change</InlineUIElement>. You should see the equivalent amount in nickels and pennies displayed.

Navigate back to the home screen by clicking the <Breadcrumb>Home</Breadcrumb> tab. Click <InlineUIElement>Refresh Token</InlineUIElement> and you should see in the logs a new token being generated. Then click <InlineUIElement>Log out</InlineUIElement>. You should see another system notification and then be redirected to FusionAuth to log out. Finally, you'll be returned to the login screen.

### Running The App On A Device

To run the app on your device, you need to make a few changes. This is because the app will be running on a different device to the FusionAuth instance, so it won't be able to access the FusionAuth instance via `localhost`.

A simple way to get around this is to use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), a tool that allows you to expose a local server to the internet. You can follow the [guide here](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/exposing-instance). Note the URL ngrok gave you as you'll need it soon.

Now that you have the URL, you need to update the FusionAuth Tenant issuer to make sure it matches the given address.

Log in to the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin), browse to <Breadcrumb>Tenants</Breadcrumb> in the sidebar, and click <IconButton icon="edit" color="blue" /> on the "Default" tenant to edit it. Paste the complete address _(with protocol and domain)_ you copied from ngrok into the <InlineField>Issuer</InlineField> field (for example, `https://6d1e-2804-431-c7c9-739-4703-98a7-4b81-5ba6.ngrok-free.app`). Save the tenant by clicking the <IconButton icon="save" color="blue" /> icon in the top-right corner.

Navigate to <Breadcrumb>Applications</Breadcrumb> and click <IconButton icon="edit" color="blue" /> on the "Example Apple SwiftUI iOS App" application. Click on the <Breadcrumb>JWT</Breadcrumb> tab, change both <InlineField>Access token signing key</InlineField> and <InlineField>Id token signing key</InlineField> to `Auto generate a new key on save...` and save the application.

<Aside type="note">
  You must create new keys after modifying the Tenant because the Issuer field is embedded in the key.
</Aside>

Now you need to update the `FusionAuth.plist` file to use the ngrok URL. Open the `FusionAuth.plist` file in the project navigator, and change the value of the `fusionAuthUrl` key to the ngrok URL.

Now you can run the app on your device. Connect your device to your computer via USB. In Xcode, select your device from the device menu in the top-left corner of the window. Click the play button in the top left corner of Xcode, or select <Breadcrumb>Product -> Run</Breadcrumb> from the menu bar. The app will be built and run on your device.

Note that you need to enable [developer mode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-developer-mode-on-a-device) on your device to run the app there. You will also need to associate a developer team with your Xcode project. You can do this by selecting the project file in the project navigator and selecting your team in the <Breadcrumb>Signing & Capabilities</Breadcrumb> tab. If you don't have a developer account, you can use your personal Apple ID as the team.

## Next Steps

<NextSteps/>

## Troubleshooting

* I can't log in

Make sure you have the right values at `Quickstart/FusionAuth.plist`. Double-check the `Issuer` in the **Tenant** to make sure it matches the URL that FusionAuth is running at including the protocol (https://).

* It still doesn't work.

You can always pull down a complete running application and compare what's different.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-swift-ios-native.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-swift-ios-native
docker compose up
```

Then open and run the Xcode project in the `complete-application` directory.
