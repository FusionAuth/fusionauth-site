You've chosen to use a GitPod instance with FusionAuth ready to go.  This instance has instructions for setting up your FusionAuth server using the Web UI and the FusionAuth REST API.

This is the best option if you want to work with FusionAuth without installing anything on your own system.

To use the GitPod instance, simply click on the button below.  A couple of notes:

- Gitpod is a free cloud environment which hosts your servers as well as an in-browser IDE experience.
- The first time you use GitPod it will show multiple forms gathering demographic data about you.
- GitPod works best in Chrome, although it has also been validated in Safari, Firefox and Edge.

You'll be presented with a New Workspace screen.  From here, click on the Continue button to proceed:

It can take a few minutes for the workspace to come up.  Please be patient.

When it has come up, you'll get instructions and a terminal to work with:

Ready to get started?  Click the button to launch your Gitpod workspace.

## Summing Up

To verify that your system is set up, navigate to http://localhost:9011 and be sure you can see the FusionAuth UI.  

You're done with step 1... congratulations!  You've got your own FusionAuth server running on your system.
Your system has been set up using a Kickstart to pre-populate the tutorial environment with an application and some users. 
Feel free to explore what's available before moving on to configuring your application's security using FusionAuth.

From here, you can return to the <a href="/docs/quickstarts#setup">guide</a> to continue on to the next step.
