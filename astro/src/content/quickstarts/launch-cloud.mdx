You've chosen to use a GitPod instance with FusionAuth ready to go.  This instance has instructions for setting up your FusionAuth server using the Web UI and the FusionAuth REST API.

This is the best option if you want to work with FusionAuth without installing anything on your own system.

To use the GitPod instance, simply click on the button below.  A couple of notes:

- The first time you use GitPod it will show multiple forms gathering demographic data about you.
- GitPod works best in Chrome, although it has also been validated in Safari, Firefox and Edge.
