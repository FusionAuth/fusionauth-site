In this tutorial, you are going to learn how to integrate a Laravel resource server with FusionAuth. You will protect an API resource from unauthorized usage. You'll be building it for [ChangeBank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXDxNCzUspM), a global leader in converting dollars into coins.

The docker compose file and source code for a complete application are available at https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-php-laravel-api.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com): The quickest way to stand up both FusionAuth and Laravel. Ensure you also have [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.
- (Alternatively, you can [Install FusionAuth Manually](/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/)).

## General Architecture

A client wants access to an API resource at `/resource`. However, it is denied this resource until it acquires an access token from FusionAuth.

<Diagram/>

While the access token is acquired via the Login API above, this is for simplicity of illustration. The token can be, and typically is, acquired through one of the [OAuth grants](/docs/v1/tech/oauth/).

## Getting Started

In this section, you’ll get FusionAuth up and running and create a resource server which will serve the API.

### Clone the Code

First off, grab the code from the repository and change into that directory.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-php-laravel-api.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-php-laravel-api
```

### Run FusionAuth via Docker

In the root directory of the repo you’ll find a Docker compose file (`docker-compose.yml`) and an environment variables configuration file (`.env`). Assuming you have Docker installed on your machine, you can stand up FusionAuth up on your machine with:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

Here you are using a bootstrapping feature of FusionAuth, called [Kickstart](/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/kickstart). When FusionAuth comes up for the first time, it will look at the `kickstart/kickstart.json` file and configure FusionAuth to a certain initial state.

<Aside type="note">
  If you ever want to reset the FusionAuth system, delete the volumes created by Docker Compose by executing `docker compose down -v`, then re-run `docker compose up -d`.
</Aside>

FusionAuth will be initially configured with these settings:

* Your client Id is <code><RemoteValue url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} selector="$.variables.applicationId" /></code>
* Your client secret is <code><RemoteValue url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} selector="$.variables.clientSecret" /></code>.
* Your example teller username is <code><RemoteValue url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} selector="$.variables.tellerEmail" /></code> and the password is <code><RemoteValue url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} selector="$.variables.tellerPassword" /></code>. They will have the role of `teller`.
* Your example customer username is <code><RemoteValue url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} selector="$.variables.customerEmail" /></code> and the password is <code><RemoteValue url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} selector="$.variables.customerPassword" /></code>. They will have the role of `customer`.
* Your admin username is <code><RemoteValue url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} selector="$.variables.adminEmail" /></code> and the password is <code><RemoteValue url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} selector="$.variables.adminPassword" /></code>.
* The base URL of FusionAuth is `http://localhost:9011/`.

You can log into the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin) and look around if you want, but with Docker/Kickstart you don't need to.

### Expose FusionAuth Instance

To make sure your local FusionAuth instance is accessible to your Laravel app, you need to [expose it to the Internet](/docs/v1/tech/developer-guide/exposing-instance). Write down the URL ngrok gave you as you'll need it soon.

## Create your Laravel Application

Now you are going to create a Laravel API application. While this section builds a simple API, you can use the same configuration to integrate an existing API with FusionAuth.

We are going to be building an API backend for a banking application called ChangeBank. This API will have two endpoints:
- `make-change`: This endpoint will allow you to call GET with a `total` amount and receive a response indicating how many nickels and pennies are needed to make change. Valid roles are `customer` and `teller`.
- `panic`: Tellers may call this endpoint to call the police in case of an incident. The only valid role is `teller`.

Both endpoints will be protected such that a valid JSON web token (JWT) will be required in the `app.at` cookie in order to be accessed. Additionally, the JWT must have a `roles` claim containing the appropriate role to use the endpoint.

<Aside type="note">
  If you simply want to run the application, there is a completed version in the `complete-application` directory. You can install [PHP](https://www.php.net) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and use the following commands to get it up and running if you do not want to create your own.

  ```shell
  cd complete-application
  composer install
  ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
  ```

  You can then follow the instructions in the "Run the API" section.
</Aside>

To create the application from scratch, you'll use [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/installation#laravel-and-docker) to set up and run your application using Docker.

```shell
curl "https://laravel.build/your-application?with=mariadb" | bash
cd your-application
```

<Aside type="note">
  This may ask for your user password to run commands with `sudo`.
</Aside>

### Initialize the Application

Initialize the Laravel application using the following command (it'll run things in background, just like `docker compose up -d` would).

```shell
./vendor/bin/sail up -d
```

<Aside type="note">
  Laravel Sail will use port 80, so make sure you don't have anything listening on that. Otherwise, you can pass an `APP_PORT` environment variable to specify another port, like shown below.

  ```shell
  APP_PORT=3000 ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
  ```
</Aside>

### Add Security

Include FusionAuth's library to add JWT support to the authentication system.

```shell
./vendor/bin/sail composer require fusionauth/jwt-auth-webtoken-provider web-token/jwt-signature-algorithm-rsa
```
### Create Fields in the User Entity

When installing Laravel, it will automatically make a migration to create a `users` table in the database. You'll have to edit the file `database/migrations/2014_10_12_000000_create_users_table.php` to change the default behavior and use UUID for the primary key, remove the need for a password and the remember token.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/database/migrations/2014_10_12_000000_create_users_table.php"} lang="php"/>

You'll also need to edit `app/Models/User.php` to make the database changes consistent with your model.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/app/Models/User.php"} lang="php"/>

You may remove all other migrations, as you won't need them.

```shell
rm database/migrations/2014_10_12_100000_create_password_reset_tokens_table.php
rm database/migrations/2019_08_19_000000_create_failed_jobs_table.php
rm database/migrations/2019_12_14_000001_create_personal_access_tokens_table.php
```

Run the remaining migrations to create the necessary tables in your database.

```shell
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate
```

### Provisioning New Users

By default, Laravel only allows JWTs that correspond to users in your database, but one of the greatest benefits of using FusionAuth is to have a single source of truth of user management. So, you want your API to automatically provision new users when it receives a trusted JWT from FusionAuth.

To do so, first create a folder named `FusionAuth` inside `app/`, and another one named `Providers` inside `FusionAuth`, so you can have `app/FusionAuth/Providers`.

```shell
mkdir -p app/FusionAuth/Providers
````

Add a new [User Provider](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/authentication#adding-custom-user-providers) at `app/FusionAuth/Providers/FusionAuthEloquentUserProvider.php` to create new users when receiving valid JWTs from FusionAuth.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/app/FusionAuth/Providers/FusionAuthEloquentUserProvider.php"} lang="php"/>

Now, add an [Authentication Guard](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/authentication#adding-custom-guards) in `app/FusionAuth/FusionAuthJwtGuard.php` to call that custom method from the User Provider created above.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/app/FusionAuth/FusionAuthJwtGuard.php"} lang="php"/>

Let Laravel know about these two classes by editing `config/auth.php`.

First, change the `driver` for the `web` Guard to `jwt`:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/config/auth.php"} tags="guards" lang="php"/>

Now, change the default `provider` to `fusionauth_eloquent`:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/config/auth.php"} tags="providers" lang="php"/>

Finally, create a [Service Provider](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/providers) in `app/FusionAuth/Providers/FusionAuthServiceProvider.php` to make sure Laravel will use the newly created classes instead of its defaults.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/app/FusionAuth/Providers/FusionAuthServiceProvider.php"} lang="php"/>

### Update Routes

Change `routes/api.php` to add both `/api/make-change` and `/api/panic` endpoints for your ChangeBank application.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/routes/api.php"} lang="php"/>

### Add Controllers

Change the base controller at `app/Http/Controllers/Controller.php` to include a helper function to check for roles.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/app/Http/Controllers/Controller.php"} lang="php"/>

Create a folder named `ChangeBank` inside `app/Http/Controllers` to hold the two controllers you're going to create.

```shell
mkdir app/Http/Controllers/ChangeBank
```

To respond the `/api/make-change` endpoint, create a file at `app/Http/Controllers/ChangeBank/MakeChangeController.php`. This controller will verify that the authenticated user has either the `teller` or `customer` role. It then takes in the URL parameter `total` to calculate which coins will be returned in the JSON payload.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/app/Http/Controllers/ChangeBank/MakeChangeController.php"} lang="php"/>

To finish, create a controller at `app/Http/Controllers/ChangeBank/PanicController.php` to handle the `/api/panic` endpoint for users with the `teller` role.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/app/Http/Controllers/ChangeBank/PanicController.php"} lang="php"/>

### Validating Issuer and Audience Claims

Besides verifying the signature, it is also recommended to validate the issuer (`iss`) and audience (`aud`) claims when receiving a JWT. To do those checks, you need to create two files.

Create a folder named `Claims` inside `app/FusionAuth`.

```shell
mkdir app/FusionAuth/Claims
```

First, create a file named `app/FusionAuth/Claims/Audience.php` that will check if the audience (`aud`) claim actually contains the Client Id for the application you created in FusionAuth.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/app/FusionAuth/Claims/Audience.php"} lang="php"/>

Now, create a file called `app/FusionAuth/Claims/Issuer.php` to check if the issuer (`iss`) is actually your FusionAuth instance address.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/app/FusionAuth/Claims/Issuer.php"} lang="php"/>

### Let Your Code Know about the FusionAuth Instance

Now that you created all these files, you need to pass some details about the FusionAuth configuration to them.

Start by adding the environment variables below to your `.env` file, changing `https://The-Address-Ngrok-Gave-You` to the actual address you copied from ngrok.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/.env"} tags="fusionauth" lang="ini"/>

Now open the `config/app.php` file and browse to the `providers` section. This is a Laravel configuration to automatically load these files when booting your application. Add `App\FusionAuth\Providers\FusionAuthServiceProvider::class` to the end of the `providers` array, like shown below.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/config/app.php"} tags="providers" lang="php"/>

In that same `config/app.php` file, add these lines at the end (just before the last line) to pass values from the environment variables to the application.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/config/app.php"} tags="fusionauth" lang="php"/>

To make the library available for use, publish its configuration by running the command below.

```shell
./vendor/bin/sail artisan vendor:publish --provider="FusionAuth\JWTAuth\WebTokenProvider\Providers\WebTokenServiceProvider"
```

## Run the API

### Get a Token

There are [several ways to acquire a token](/docs/v1/tech/oauth/) in FusionAuth, but for this example you will use the [Login API](/docs/v1/tech/apis/login) to keep things simple.

First, try requests as the <code><RemoteValue url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} selector="$.variables.tellerEmail" /></code> user. Based on the configuration this user has the `teller` role and should be able to use both `/api/make-change` and `/api/panic`.

1. Acquire an access token for <code><RemoteValue url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} selector="$.variables.tellerEmail" /></code> by making the following request

<RemoteValue
  url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"}
  selector="$.variables">
  {(variables) => <Code lang="shell" code={`curl --location 'http://localhost:9011/api/login' \\
--header 'Authorization: ${variables.apiKey}' \\
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
--data-raw '{
  "loginId": "${variables.tellerEmail}",
  "password": "${variables.tellerPassword}",
  "applicationId": "${variables.applicationId}"
}'`}/>}
</RemoteValue>

Copy the `token` from the response, which should look like this:

```json
{
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6InVOYl9iQzFySHZZTnZMc285VzRkOEprZkxLWSJ9.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.WLzI9hSsCDn3ZoHKA9gaifkd6ASjT03JUmROGFZaezz9xfVbO3quJXEpUpI3poLozYxVcj2hrxKpNT9b7Sp16CUahev5tM0-4_FaYlmUEoMZBKo2JRSH8hg-qVDvnpeu8nL6FXxJII0IK4FNVwrQVFmAz99ZCf7m5xruQSziXPrfDYSU-3OZJ3SRuvD8bMopSiyRvZLx6YjWfBsvGSmMXeh_8vHG5fVkq5w1IkaDdugHnivtJIivHuCfl38kQBgw9rAqJLJoKRHHW0Ha7vHIcS6OCWWMDIIVspLyQNcLC16pL9Nss_5v9HMofow1OvQ9sUSMrbbkipjKq2peSjG7qA",
    "tokenExpirationInstant": 1689353059670,
    "user": {
        ...
    }
}
```

### Make the Request

Make a request to `/api/make-change` with a query parameter `total=5.12` and passing the `token` in an `app.at` cookie.

```shell
curl --cookie 'app.at=YOUR_TOKEN' 'http://localhost/api/make-change?total=5.12'
```

The response should look similar to below, however it has been formatted here for readability:

```json
{
  "Message": "We can make change using 20 quarters 1 dimes 0 nickels 2 pennies",
  "Change": [
    {
      "Denomination": "quarters",
      "Count": 20
    },
    {
      "Denomination": "dimes",
      "Count": 1
    },
    {
      "Denomination": "nickels",
      "Count": 0
    },
    {
      "Denomination": "pennies",
      "Count": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

You were authorized, success! You can try making the request without the cookie or with a different string rather than a valid token, and see that you are denied access.

Next call the `/api/panic` endpoint because you are in trouble!

```shell
curl --cookie 'app.at=YOUR_TOKEN' --request POST 'http://localhost/api/panic'
```

This is a `POST` (not a `GET`) because you want all your emergency calls to be non-idempotent.

Your response should look like this:

```json
{"message":"We've called the police!"}
```

Nice, help is on the way!

Now let's try as `customer@example.com` who has the role `customer`. Acquire a token for `customer@example.com`.

<RemoteValue
    url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"}
    selector="$.variables">
    {(variables) => <Code lang="shell" code={`curl --location 'http://localhost:9011/api/login' \\
--header 'Authorization: ${variables.apiKey}' \\
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
--data-raw '{
  "loginId": "${variables.customerEmail}",
  "password": "${variables.customerPassword}",
  "applicationId": "${variables.applicationId}"
}'`}/>}
</RemoteValue>

Your response should look like this:

```json
{
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6InVOYl9iQzFySHZZTnZMc285VzRkOEprZkxLWSJ9.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.T1bELQ6a_ItOS0_YYpvqhIVknVMNeamcoC7BWnPjg2lgA9XpCmFA2mVnycoeuz-mSOHbp2cCoauP5opxehBR2lCn4Sz0If6PqgJgXKEpxh5pAxCPt91UyfjH8hGDqE3rDh7E4Hqn7mb-dFFwdfX7CMdKvC3dppMbXAGCZTl0LizApw5KIG9Wmt670339pSf5lzD38P9WAG5Wr7fAmVrIJPVu6yv2FoR-pMYD2lnAF63HWKknrWB-khmhr9ZKRLXKhP1UK-ThY1FSnmpp8eNblsBqCxf6WaYxYkdp5_F2e56M4sQwHzrg4P9tZGVCmMri4dShF3Ck7OGa7hel-iIPew",
    "tokenExpirationInstant": 1689354123118,
    "user": {
        ...
    }
}
```

Now use that token to call `/api/make-change` with a query parameter `total=3.24`.

```shell
curl --cookie 'app.at=YOUR_TOKEN' --location 'http://localhost/api/make-change?total=3.24'
```

The response should look similar to below, however it has been formatted here for readability:

```json
{
  "Message": "We can make change using 12 quarters 2 dimes 0 nickels 4 pennies",
  "Change": [
    {
      "Denomination": "quarters",
      "Count": 12
    },
    {
      "Denomination": "dimes",
      "Count": 2
    },
    {
      "Denomination": "nickels",
      "Count": 0
    },
    {
      "Denomination": "pennies",
      "Count": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

So far so good. Now call the `/api/panic` endpoint with `-i` flag to see the headers of the response).

```shell
curl --cookie 'app.at=YOUR_TOKEN' -i --request POST -H "Accept: application/json" 'http://localhost/api/panic'
```

Your should receive a `403 Forbidden` response with the following message and a huge stack trace (because you are in development mode):

```json
{
    "message": "Proper role not found for user.",
    "exception": "Symfony\\Component\\HttpKernel\\Exception\\AccessDeniedHttpException",
    ...
}
```

Looks like this user does not have access to this function. Enjoy your secured resource server!

## Next Steps

This quickstart is a great way to get a proof of concept up and running quickly, but to run your API in production, there are some things you're going to want to do.

### FusionAuth Integration

* Rather than call the Login API, you're probably going to want to use the [Authorization Code grant](/docs/v1/tech/oauth/#example-authorization-code-grant), which keeps all sensitive credentials within the bounds of FusionAuth. You can customize the [hosted login pages](/docs/v1/tech/themes/).
* You may want to generate a token using the [Client Credentials grant](/docs/v1/tech/oauth/#example-client-credentials-grant) if you are calling the API from another service.

### Security
* Customize the [token expiration times and policies](/docs/v1/tech/oauth/#configure-application-oauth-settings) in FusionAuth
* [Make sure you know how to securely consume a token](/articles/tokens/building-a-secure-jwt#consuming-a-jwt)
* Secure your API [using an API gateway](/docs/v1/tech/developer-guide/api-gateways/) rather than at the framework layer.

## Troubleshooting

* I get `This site can’t be reached localhost refused to connect.` when I call the Login API.

Ensure FusionAuth is running in the Docker container. You should be able to login as the admin user, `admin@example.com` with a password of `password` at [http://localhost:9011/admin](http://localhost:9011/admin).

* The `/api/panic` endpoint doesn't work when I call it.

Make sure you are making a `POST` call and using a token with the `teller` role.

* It still doesn't work

You can always pull down a complete running application and compare what's different.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-php-laravel-api.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-php-laravel-api
docker compose up -d
cd complete-application
composer install
./vendor/bin/sail up -d
```
