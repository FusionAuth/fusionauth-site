import {RemoteCode} from '@fusionauth/astro-components';

To use FusionAuth download the `docker-compose.yml` and the `.env` files and then start up the configured containers.

```shell title="Download the FusionAuth docker files"
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/main/docker/fusionauth/docker-compose.yml
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/main/docker/fusionauth/.env
```

Edit these files as needed. The stock `.env` file will contain the following values, you will want to modify the `DATABASE_PASSWORD` and ensure the `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` values are correct. You may also override any of these values using environment variables.

<RemoteCode lang="shell"
            url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/main/docker/fusionauth/.env"
            title="The .env file" />

```shell title="Starting FusionAuth"
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f
```
