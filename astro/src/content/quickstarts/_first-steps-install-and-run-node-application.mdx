The repository you will use has a complete running application.  For this quick guide, you will use that version.  

To get started, clone the project, and navigate to the project directory.

```shell title="Get the Example Application Code"
git clone https://github.com/synedra/fusionauth-first-steps-launch  \
&& cd fusionauth-gitpod-install 
cd complete-application
npm install
npm run dev
```

At this point you can point your browser to http://localhost:3000 and view the ChangeBank app.
