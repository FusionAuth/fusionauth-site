In this quickstart you are going to build an Android app and integrate it with FusionAuth.
You'll be building it for [ChangeBank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkH-kD73QUM), a global leader in converting dollars into coins.
It'll have areas reserved for users who have logged in as well as public facing sections.

The docker compose file and source code for a complete application are available at
https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-android-java

## Prerequisites

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio): The official IDE for Android will help you develop and install necessary tools to set it up.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/site): You'll use to clone the base repository.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com): The quickest way to stand up FusionAuth. (There are [other ways](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/)).

This app was built on top of the [AppAuth demo app](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/), which is a client SDK for communicating with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect providers, and it supports Android API 16 (Jellybean) and above.

## General Architecture

While this sample application doesn't have login functionality without FusionAuth, a more typical integration will replace an existing login system with FusionAuth.

In that case, the system might look like this before FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginBefore/>

The login flow will look like this after FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginAfter/>

In general, you are introducing FusionAuth in order to normalize and consolidate user data. This helps make sure it is consistent and up-to-date as well as offloading your login security and functionality to FusionAuth.

## Getting Started

In this section, you'll get FusionAuth up and running and use `git` to create a new application.

### Clone the Code

First off, grab the code from the repository and change into that directory.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-android-java.git
cd fusionauth-example-android-java
```

### Run FusionAuth via Docker

In the root directory of the repo you'll find a Docker compose file (`docker-compose.yml`) and an environment variables configuration file (`.env`). Assuming you have Docker installed on your machine, you can stand up FusionAuth up on your machine with:

```
docker compose up -d
```

Here you are using a bootstrapping feature of FusionAuth, called [Kickstart](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/kickstart). When FusionAuth comes up for the first time, it will look at the `kickstart/kickstart.json` file and configure FusionAuth to a certain initial state.

<Aside type="note">
    If you ever want to reset the FusionAuth system, delete the volumes created by docker compose by executing `docker compose down -v`, then re-run `docker compose up -d`.
</Aside>

FusionAuth will be initially configured with these settings:

* Your client Id is `e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e`.
* Your client secret is `super-secret-secret-that-should-be-regenerated-for-production`.
* Your example username is `richard@example.com` and the password is `password`.
* Your admin username is `admin@example.com` and the password is `password`.
* The base URL of FusionAuth `http://localhost:9011/`.

You can log into the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin) and look around if you want, but with Docker/Kickstart you don't need to.

### Create your Android App

Now you are going to create an Android app. While this section builds a simple Android app on top of the [AppAuth demo app](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/), you can use the same configuration to integrate your existing app with FusionAuth.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/openid-AppAuth-Android.git
cd openid-AppAuth-Android
```

### Configure AppAuth

You'll have to change some files to integrate FusionAuth into your app.
