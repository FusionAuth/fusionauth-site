This quickstart will show you how to build an application with Ruby on Rails and integrate it with FusionAuth.
You'll build the application for [ChangeBank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXDxNCzUspM), a global leader in converting dollars to coins.
The app will have areas reserved for logged in users and public-facing sections.

The Docker Compose file and source code for a complete application are available at
https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web.

## Prerequisites

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/): For pulling down the various dependencies.
- [Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html): To run the Rails server.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com): The quickest way to stand up FusionAuth. (There are [other ways](/docs/get-started/download-and-install).)

This app has been tested with Ruby 3.2.2 and Rails 7.0.4.3. This example should work with other compatible versions of Ruby and Rails.

## General Architecture

While this sample application doesn't have login functionality without FusionAuth, a more typical integration will replace an existing login system with FusionAuth.

The system might look like this before FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginBefore alt={"Request flow during login before FusionAuth"}/>

The login flow will look like this after FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginAfter alt={"Request flow during login after FusionAuth"}/>

In general, you would introduce FusionAuth to normalize and consolidate user data so that it is consistent and up to date, and offload your login security and functionality to FusionAuth.

## Getting Started

In this section, you'll get FusionAuth up and running and use Rails to create a new application.

### Clone The Code

First, grab the code from the repository and change to that directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web
```

### Run FusionAuth Via Docker

You'll find a Docker Compose file `docker-compose.yml` and an environment variables configuration file `.env` in the root folder of the repository. Assuming you have Docker installed, you can stand up FusionAuth on your machine with the following.

```
docker compose up -d
```

Here you are using a bootstrapping feature of FusionAuth called [Kickstart](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/kickstart). When FusionAuth comes up for the first time, it will look at the `kickstart/kickstart.json` file and configure FusionAuth to your specified state.

<Aside type="note">
If you ever want to reset the FusionAuth system, delete the volumes created by Docker Compose by executing `docker compose down -v`, then rerun `docker compose up -d`.
</Aside>

FusionAuth will be initially configured with these settings:

* Your client Id is <code><RemoteValue url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/kickstart/kickstart.json" selector="$.variables.applicationId" /></code>.
* Your client secret is <code><RemoteValue url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/kickstart/kickstart.json" selector="$.requests.[?(@.url === '/api/application/#{applicationId}')].body.application.oauthConfiguration.clientSecret" /></code>.
* Your example username is <code><RemoteValue url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/kickstart/kickstart.json" selector="$.variables.userEmail" /></code> and the password is <code><RemoteValue url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/kickstart/kickstart.json" selector="$.variables.userPassword" /></code>.
* Your admin username is <code><RemoteValue url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/kickstart/kickstart.json" selector="$.variables.adminEmail" /></code> and the password is <code><RemoteValue url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/kickstart/kickstart.json" selector="$.variables.adminPassword" /></code>.
* The base URL of FusionAuth is `http://localhost:9011/`.

You can log in to the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin) and look around if you like but with Docker and Kickstart, you don't need to.

### Create Your Ruby On Rails Application

Now you will create a Ruby on Rails application. While this section builds a simple Ruby on Rails application, you can use the same configuration to integrate your existing Ruby on Rails application with FusionAuth.

```bash
rails new myapp && cd myapp
```

## Authentication

We'll use the [OmniAuth Library](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth), which simplifies integrating with FusionAuth and creating a secure web application.

### Configure OmniAuth

Install the OmniAuth gem and other supporting gems. Add the following three lines to your `Gemfile`.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/Gemfile"
 lang="ruby"
 tags="gemfile"/>

Then install them.

```bash
bundle install
```

Next, update your `config/environments/development.rb` file with FusionAuth OpenID Connect (OIDC) environment-specific configuration.

<Aside type="tip">
You'll need to add similar configuration to the correct environment files when deploying to prod or other environments.
</Aside>

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/config/environments/development.rb"
lang="ruby"
tags="oidcConfig"/>

Configure OmniAuth by creating `config/initializers/omniauth.rb` with the following code:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/config/initializers/omniauth.rb"
lang="ruby" />

This code pulls values from the environment file and configures the OmniAuth gem to communicate with FusionAuth.

### Add Controllers

Next, you can create some controllers with the following shell commands:

```shell
rails generate controller auth
rails generate controller home
rails generate controller make_change
```

These controllers have the following purposes:

* `auth` is for OmniAuth integration.
* `home` is an unprotected home page with a login button.
* `make_change` is a protected page for our example bank application.

First, update the `config/routes.rb` file to look like the following.

<RemoteCode url="
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/config/routes.rb"
lang="ruby" />

Some simple routes corresponding to the controllers:

* `make_change` is the protected bank page.
* `home` is the home page, which is the default page and available to unauthenticated users.
* `logout` is tied to the auth controller's logout method.
* `auth/:provider/callback` is the OmniAuth callback method, which completes the OIDC grant.

Now, update the auth controller at `app/controllers/auth_controller.rb` as follows to complete some of the routes defined above.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/app/controllers/auth_controller.rb"
lang="ruby" />

This provides a nice `logout` method and handles the callback from OmniAuth by setting a `session` attribute with user data that views can use later.

Now, update the application controller at `app/controllers/application_controller.rb`.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/app/controllers/application_controller.rb"
lang="ruby" />

- `authenticate_user!` enforces authentication for all routes in your application by checking for the session attribute set by the auth controller after a successful login.
- `redirect_non_localhost!` ensures users access the web app via `localhost` instead of a URL like http:127.0.0.1:3000/. FusionAuth origin and redirect URL configurations in this example expect `localhost`. In production, update this with your domain name.

Now, let's build out the home page. Update the home controller at `app/controllers/home_controller.rb` to look like the following.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/app/controllers/home_controller.rb"
lang="ruby" />

You're skipping authentication for this route. After all, a user has to have someplace to go if they are unauthenticated, right?

Finally, add some business logic for logged in users to make change with the following code in `app/controllers/make_change_controller.rb`.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/app/controllers/make_change_controller.rb"
lang="ruby" />

## App Customization

In this section, you'll turn your application into a trivial banking application with some styling.

### Add Views

The view either welcomes the user and prompts them to log in or shows a mock account balance. Replace `app/views/home/index.html.erb` with this code.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/app/views/home/index.html.erb"
lang="erb" />

Next, update the layout so the user has login or logout buttons on every page. Add the below code to `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` just after the `<body>` tag.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb"
lang="erb"
tags="applicationLayout"/>

Finally, add a form and messaging to make change at `app/views/make_change/index.html.erb`.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/app/views/make_change/index.html.erb"
lang="erb" />

### Add Styling

Now, add some image assets and styling to make this look like a real application with the following shell commands.

```shell
curl -o app/assets/images/example_bank_logo.svg https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/app/assets/images/example_bank_logo.svg
curl -o app/assets/images/fusion_auth_logo.svg https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/app/assets/images/fusion_auth_logo.svg
curl -o app/assets/images/money.jpg https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/app/assets/images/money.jpg
curl -o app/assets/stylesheets/changebank.css https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/app/assets/stylesheets/changebank.css
```

Once you’ve created these files, you can test the application.

## Run The App

Start up the Rails application using this command.

<RemoteValue
  url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/kickstart/kickstart.json"
  selector="$.requests.[?(@.url === '/api/application/#{applicationId}')].body.application.oauthConfiguration.clientSecret">
  {(value) => <Code lang="shell" code={`OP_SECRET_KEY="${value}" bundle exec rails s`} />}
</RemoteValue>

`OP_SECRET_KEY` is the client secret, which was defined in the [run FusionAuth via Docker](#run-fusionauth-via-docker) step. You don't want to commit secrets like this to version control, so use an environment variable.

You can now open an incognito window and visit the Rails app at http://localhost:3000. Log in with the user account you created when setting up FusionAuth, and you’ll see the email of the user next to a logout button.

## Next Steps
This quickstart is a great way to get a proof of concept up and running quickly, but to run your application in production, there are some things you might want to do.

### FusionAuth Customization
FusionAuth gives you the ability to customize just about everything to do with the user's experience and your application's integration, including:
* [Hosted pages](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/) such as login, registration, email verification, and many more
* [Email templates](/docs/customize/email-and-messages/email-templates)
* [User data and custom claims in access token JWTs](/articles/tokens/jwt-components-explained)

### Security
* [OmniAuth OpenIDConnect](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth) handles token validation and refresh
* You may want to customize the [token expiration times and policies](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/#configure-application-oauth-settings) in FusionAuth
* Choose [password rules](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/tenants#password) and a [hashing algorithm](/docs/reference/password-hashes) that meet your security needs

### Tenant And Application Management
* Model your application topology using [Applications](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/applications), [Roles](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/roles), [Groups](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/groups), [Entities](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/groups), and more
* Set up [MFA](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/multi-factor-authentication), [Social login](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/identity-providers/), and/or [SAML](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/identity-providers/overview-samlv2) integrations
* Integrate with external systems using [Webhooks](/docs/extend/events-and-webhooks/), [SCIM](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/scim/scim), and [Lambdas](/docs/extend/code/lambdas/)

## Troubleshooting

* I get `This site can’t be reached localhost refused to connect` when I click the login button.

Ensure FusionAuth is running in the Docker container. You should be able to log in as the admin user <code><RemoteValue url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/kickstart/kickstart.json" selector="$.variables.adminEmail" /></code> with the password <code><RemoteValue url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/kickstart/kickstart.json" selector="$.variables.adminPassword" /></code> at [http://localhost:9011/admin](http://localhost:9011/admin).

* I get an error page with the message `"error_reason" : "invalid_client_id"` when I click the login button.

Ensure the value for `config.x.fusionauth.client_id` in the file `config/environments/development.rb` matches the client Id configured in FusionAuth for the example app at [http://localhost:9011/admin/application/](http://localhost:9011/admin/application/).

* I'm getting an error from Rails after logging in

```
Rack::OAuth2::Client::Error
invalid_client :: Invalid client authentication credentials.
```

This indicates that OmniAuth is unable to call FusionAuth to validate the returned token, likely caused by an incorrect client secret. Ensure the `OP_SECRET_KEY` environment variable used to start Rails matches the FusionAuth example app client secret. You can review the client secret by logging in as the admin user and examining the application at [http://localhost:9011/admin/application/](http://localhost:9011/admin/application/).

* It still doesn't work.

You can always pull down a complete running application and compare what's different.

<RemoteValue
  url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/kickstart/kickstart.json"
  selector="$.requests.[?(@.url === '/api/application/#{applicationId}')].body.application.oauthConfiguration.clientSecret">
  {(value) => (
    <Code lang="shell" code={`git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web
docker-compose up -d
cd complete-app
bundle install
OP_SECRET_KEY=${value} bundle exec rails s`}/>
  )}
</RemoteValue>
