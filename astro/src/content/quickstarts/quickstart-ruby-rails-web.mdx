## Prerequisites

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/): This will be needed for pulling down the various dependencies.
- [Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html): This will be used in order to run the Rails server.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com): The quickest way to stand up FusionAuth. (There are [other ways](/docs/get-started/download-and-install)).

This app has been tested with Ruby 3.2.2 and Rails 7.0.4.3. This example should work with other compatible versions of Ruby and Rails.

## General Architecture

<LoginArchitectureWeb />

## Getting Started

In this section, you'll get FusionAuth up and running and use Rails to create a new application.

### Clone the Code

First off, grab the code from the repository and change into that directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web
```

### Run FusionAuth via Docker

<DockerSpinup kickstartUri="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/kickstart/kickstart.json" />

### Create your Ruby on Rails Application

Now you are going to create a Ruby on Rails application. While this section builds a simple Ruby on Rails application, you can use the same configuration to integrate your existing Ruby on Rails application with FusionAuth.

```bash
rails new myapp && cd myapp
```

## Authentication

We'll use the [OmniAuth Library](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth), which simplifies integrating with FusionAuth and creating a secure web application.

### Configure OmniAuth

Install the omniauth gem and other supporting gems. Add the following three lines to your `Gemfile`.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/Gemfile"
 lang="ruby"
 tags="gemfile"/>

Then, install them.

```bash
bundle install
```

Next, update your `config/environments/development.rb` file with FusionAuth OpenID Connect (OIDC) environment specific configuration.

<Aside type="tip">
You'll have to add similar configuration to the correct environment files when deploying to prod or other environments.
</Aside>

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/config/environments/development.rb"
lang="ruby"
tags="oidcConfig"/>

Configure OmniAuth by creating `config/initializers/omniauth.rb` with the following code:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/config/initializers/omniauth.rb"
lang="ruby" />

This pulls values from the environment file and configures the omniauth gem to communicate with FusionAuth.

### Add Controllers

Next, you can create some controllers with the following shell commands:

```shell
rails generate controller auth
rails generate controller home
rails generate controller make_change
```

These controllers have the following purposes:

* `auth` is for omniauth integration
* `home` is an unprotected home page with a login button
* `make_change` is a protected page for our example bank application

First, let's update the `config/routes.rb` file. Here's what that should look like:

<RemoteCode url="
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/config/routes.rb"
lang="ruby" />

Some simple routes corresponding to the controllers:

* `make_change` is the protected bank page
* `home` is the home page, which is available to unauthenticated users. This is also the default page.
* `logout` is tied to the auth controller's logout method.
* `auth/:provider/callback` is the omniauth callback method, which completes the OIDC grant.

Now, update the auth controller at `app/controllers/auth_controller.rb` to look like this, which completes some of the routes defined above.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/app/controllers/auth_controller.rb"
lang="ruby" />

This lets you have a nice `logout` method and also handle the callback from omniauth. The latter sets a `session` attribute with user data, which can be used by views later.

Now, update the application controller at `app/controllers/application_controller.rb`.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/app/controllers/application_controller.rb"
lang="ruby" />

- `authenticate_user!` enforces authentication for all routes in your application by checking for the session attribute set by the auth controller after a successful login.
- `redirect_non_localhost!` ensures users access the web app via `localhost` instead of a URL like http:127.0.0.1:3000/ .  FusionAuth's origin and redirect URL configurations in this example expect `localhost`.  In production, update this with your domain name.

Now, let's build out the home page. Update the home controller at `app/controllers/home_controller.rb` to look like this:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/app/controllers/home_controller.rb"
lang="ruby" />

You're skipping authentication for this route. After all, a user has to have someplace to go if they are unauthenticated, right?

Finally, we'll add some business logic for logged in users to make change with the following code in `app/controllers/make_change_controller.rb`:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/app/controllers/make_change_controller.rb"
lang="ruby" />

## App Customization

In this section, you'll turn your application into a trivial banking application with some styling.

### Add Views

The view is welcoming, but prompts them to login. Otherwise, it shows a mock account balance. Replace `app/views/home/index.html.erb` with this code:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/app/views/home/index.html.erb"
lang="erb" />

Next, update the layout so the user has login or logout buttons on every page. Add the below code to `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` just after the `<body>` tag.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb"
lang="erb"
tags="applicationLayout"/>

Finally, add a form and messaging for making change at `app/views/make_change/index.html.erb`:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/app/views/make_change/index.html.erb"
lang="erb" />

### Add Styling

Now, add some image assets and styling to make this look like a real application with the following shell commands:

```shell
curl -o app/assets/images/example_bank_logo.svg https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/app/assets/images/example_bank_logo.svg
curl -o app/assets/images/fusion_auth_logo.svg https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/app/assets/images/fusion_auth_logo.svg
curl -o app/assets/images/money.jpg https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/app/assets/images/money.jpg
curl -o app/assets/stylesheets/changebank.css https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/app/assets/stylesheets/changebank.css
```

Once you’ve created these files, you can test the application out.

## Run the App

Start up the Rails application using this command:

<RemoteValue
  url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/kickstart/kickstart.json"
  selector="$.requests.[?(@.url === '/api/application/#{applicationId}')].body.application.oauthConfiguration.clientSecret">
  {(value) => <Code lang="shell" code={`OP_SECRET_KEY="${value}" bundle exec rails s`} />}
</RemoteValue>

`OP_SECRET_KEY` is the client secret, which was defined by the [FusionAuth Installation via Docker](#run-fusionauth-via-docker) step. You don't want to commit secrets like this to version control, so use an environment variable.

You can now open up an incognito window and visit the Rails app at http://localhost:3000 . Log in with the user account you created when setting up FusionAuth, and you’ll see the email of the user next to a logout button.

## Troubleshooting

* I get `This site can’t be reached  localhost refused to connect.` when I click the Login button

Ensure FusionAuth is running in the Docker container.  You should be able to login as the admin user, <code><RemoteValue url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/kickstart/kickstart.json" selector="$.variables.adminEmail" /></code> with a password of <code><RemoteValue url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/kickstart/kickstart.json" selector="$.variables.adminPassword" /></code> at [http://localhost:9011/admin](http://localhost:9011/admin).

* I get an error page when I click on the Login button with message of `"error_reason" : "invalid_client_id"`

Ensure the value for `config.x.fusionauth.client_id` in the file `config/environments/development.rb` matches client Id configured in FusionAuth for the Example App Application at [http://localhost:9011/admin/application/](http://localhost:9011/admin/application/).

* I'm getting an error from Rails after logging in

```
Rack::OAuth2::Client::Error
invalid_client :: Invalid client authentication credentials.
```

This indicates that OmniAuth is unable to call FusionAuth to validate the returned token.  It is likely caused because of an incorrect client secret.  Ensure the `OP_SECRET_KEY` environment variable used to start rails matches the FusionAuth ExampleApp client secret. You can review that by logging in as the admin user and examining the Application at [http://localhost:9011/admin/application/](http://localhost:9011/admin/application/)

* It still doesn't work

You can always pull down a complete running application and compare what's different.

<RemoteValue
  url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/kickstart/kickstart.json"
  selector="$.requests.[?(@.url === '/api/application/#{applicationId}')].body.application.oauthConfiguration.clientSecret">
  {(value) => (
    <Code lang="shell" code={`git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web
docker compose up -d
cd complete-app
bundle install
OP_SECRET_KEY=${value} bundle exec rails s`}/>
  )}
</RemoteValue>
