## Integrate Your Java Spring Application With FusionAuth
In this tutorial, you are going to learn how to integrate a Java Spring Boot application with FusionAuth.

The docker compose file and source code for a complete application, as well as a stub application for you to code yourself, are available at https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-springboot-web.

## Prerequisites
- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/): Java can be installed via a variety of methods.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com): The quickest way to stand up FusionAuth. Ensure you also have [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.
  - (Alternatively, you can [Install FusionAuth Manually](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/)).

The example repository has already set up a Spring Boot template application that includes a Maven wrapper. You can find out more about those by viewing:
- [Spring initializr](https://start.spring.io/): The Spring Boot template generator webpage.
- [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/): A self-contained version of the Maven build tool which will download the application dependencies and compile the source code.

This app was built using Java 17. You can change which version to use by editing the project's `pom.xml` file. The code in this example should be compatible down to Java 8, though minor differences may occur.

## Create your Spring Boot Application with Thymeleaf

### Overview of the Application

We are going to be building a version of the ChangeBank app. This app will allow you to log in and see your "balance", as well as present a page that you can input a dollar amount and have that broken into change of dimes and pennies. You won't be keeping track of any account state beyond the user in FusionAuth, so the only actual functionality you will implement is the api call to make change.

You are going to build an application with three views:
- `Home`: This is the welcome page than an unauthenticated user will see when first visiting your application.
- `Account`: This is a protected view the user can only see after they have logged in.
- `Make Change`: This view is also protected and demonstrates making an authenticated form post to the backend.

### Downloading the template from Spring Initializr

We have already done this for you in the example repository, but if you wish to do so yourself you can go to the Initializr site at https://start.spring.io/ and download your own starter package. We will rely on three dependencies for this project:

- OAuth2 Client
- Thymeleaf
- Spring Web

This example was made with `Maven`, Spring Boot version `2.7.12`, and Java 17. If you choose different options the configuration and code may be different.

If you choose you can download and unzip the package in any directory you wish and proceed to follow along with the rest of this guide. The directions will assume you are in `stub-application` from the example repository. Please substitute that directory with wherever you unzipped the files from Spring.

### Install the dependencies

From the `stub-application` directory run the following to execute the Maven build tool to download dependencies and build your application.

```shell
./mvnw package
```
Note: if you are on Windows substitute `./mvnw` with `.\mvnw.cmd`

### Configure Spring Application Properties

From the `stub-application` directory open `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-springboot-web/main/complete-application/src/main/resources/application.properties"
            lang="ini"/>

The properties with the `spring.thymeleaf` prefix enable Thymeleaf for server-side template rendering and defines the location and suffix of the template files.

The `spring.application.name` property defines the app name, which will show up in your application view.

The properties with the `spring.security.oauth2.client.registration` prefix configure the settings for the OAuth2 Client. The `client-id`, `client-secret`, `redirect-uri` and `authorization-grant-type` all need to match what is configured in FusionAuth. If you used the Kickstart method these settings should be correct, however if they are not you can log in to http://localhost:9011/admin and check the [OAuth Settings](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/applications#oauth) for your application.

The properties with the `spring.security.oauth2.provider` prefix tell Spring where the important endpoints for FusionAuth are.

### Add controllers

Find the `base directory` when the main application java class is defined. In our example this is `src/main/java/io/quickstart/springweb` and the main class is `FusionAuthSpringApplication.java`.

Create the following new java classes in the `base directory`:

`HomeController.java`

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-springboot-web/main/complete-application/src/main/java/io/fusionauth/quickstart/springweb/HomeController.java"
            lang="java"/>

This controller serves the page for unauthenticated users on the `/` route and shows the application name which is injected from the `spring.application.name` property in the `application.properties` file. The return string `home` tells Spring to render the `home.html` template.

`Account.java`

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-springboot-web/main/complete-application/src/main/java/io/fusionauth/quickstart/springweb/AccountController.java"
            lang="java"/>

This controller serves the page for authenticated users on the `/account` route and adds the claims from the `OidcUser` returned from FusionAuth to the view model on the `profile` attribute (more on that later). The return string `account` tells Spring to render the `account.html` template.

`MakeChange.java`

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-springboot-web/main/complete-application/src/main/java/io/fusionauth/quickstart/springweb/MakeChangeController.java"
            lang="java"/>

This controller serves both GET and POST requests on the `/make-change` route. Both methods add the claims to the `profile` attribute like `Account.java` does. The `GetMapping` adds a new model object of `Change` to view model as well. The `PostMapping` takes the `Change` object as a parameter and uses the `total` to calculate how many nickels and pennies to return. If `total` is not a valid dollar (BigDecimal) value it adds an error to the Change model object. The return string `make-change` tells Spring to render the `make-change.html` template.

### Add the model object

We need to create the model object referenced in the controllers. From the `base directory` create a new directory `model` and in it add a new class `Change.java`

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-springboot-web/main/complete-application/src/main/java/io/fusionauth/quickstart/springweb/model/Change.java"
            lang="java" />

This model has four fields
- `error`: The error string if the input was invalid.
- `total`: The total amount to divide into pennies and nickels.
- `nickels`: The number of pennies returned from the "make change" operation.
- `pennies`: The number of pennies returned from the "make change" operation.

It additionally has a method `getMessage` which formats a message string to render on the template.

### Add view templates

Now you need to add some views for Thymeleaf to render on the routes you just defined. Add three files into `src/main/resources/templates`:

`home.html`

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-springboot-web/main/complete-application/src/main/resources/templates/home.html"
            lang="html" />

Note that this template has hrefs to `/account` for login. Spring will automatically know that the user is not logged in and redirect them to FusionAuth based on what was defined in `application.properties`.

`account.html`

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-springboot-web/main/complete-application/src/main/resources/templates/account.html"
            lang="html" />

Similarly, this page has a href to `/logout` that Spring will use to redirect the user to FusionAuth for logout. It also references the `${profile.email}` claim that was set in controller.

`make-change.html`

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-springboot-web/main/complete-application/src/main/resources/templates/make-change.html"
            lang="html" />

In addition to the references made above, this template adds a form which binds the `${change}` object as the model, submits the `*{total}` as input by the user, and displays the message or error depending on what is defined in the `Change` object.

### Add static assets

There are some references to a stylesheet and images in those templates. You should add them here.

In `src/main/resourcs/static/images` you can download our [bank logo image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-springboot-web/main/complete-application/src/main/resources/static/images/example_bank_logo.svg) as `example_bank_logo.svg` and our [money image](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-springboot-web/blob/main/complete-application/src/main/resources/static/images/money.jpg) as `money.jpg`.

In `src/main/resources/static/css` you should add `styles.css`

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-springboot-web/main/complete-application/src/main/resources/static/css/styles.css"
            lang="css" />

Feel free to update and style as you see fit, just be sure to update the templates if you change images.

### Configure Spring Web and Spring Security

Almost done!

In order for this application to work you will need two more configuration java classes. From the `base directory` add a new directory `config` and in it add the following:

`SecurityConfiguration.java`

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-springboot-web/main/complete-application/src/main/java/io/fusionauth/quickstart/springweb/config/SecurityConfiguration.java"
            lang="java" />

This class uses the `@Configuration` annotation to tell Spring it is providing additional configuration, in this case a `SecurityFilterChain` which ultimately does two things:

- Tells Spring to require authentication for all requests *except* to `/` (i.e. `home.html`), `/images`, and `/css` (implicitly referring to the directories under `src/main/resources/static`).
- Tells Spring to redirect the user on logout to FusionAuth to complete the logout.

`WebConfig.java`

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-springboot-web/main/complete-application/src/main/java/io/fusionauth/quickstart/springweb/config/WebConfig.java"
            lang="java" />

This configuration class enables web mvc and sets up resource handlers for the static assets.

### Run the app

Now from the root directory run

```shell
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

You can open the application at http://localhost:8080

Congratulations! Have fun with FusionAuth!
