In this quickstart you are going to build an application with Express and integrate it with FusionAuth.
You'll be building it for [ChangeBank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkH-kD73QUM), a global leader in converting dollars into coins.
It'll have areas reserved for users who have logged in as well as public facing sections.

The docker compose file and source code for a complete application are available at
https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-express-web

## Prerequisites
* [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com): The quickest way to stand up FusionAuth. (There are [other ways](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/)).
* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/): Not required but recomended if you want to track your chnages.

## General architecture

While this sample application doesn't have login functionality without FusionAuth, a more typical integration will replace an existing login system with FusionAuth.

In that case, the system might look like this before FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginBefore alt={"Request flow during login before FusionAuth"}/>

The login flow will look like this after FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginAfter alt={"Request flow during login after FusionAuth"}/>

In general, you are introducing FusionAuth in order to normalize and consolidate user data. This helps make sure it is consistent and up-to-date as well as offloading your login security and functionality to FusionAuth.

## Getting Started
In this section, you'll get FusionAuth up and running, and configured with the ChangeBank application.

### Clone the Code
First off, grab the code from the repository and change into that directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-express-web.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-express-web
```

### Run FusionAuth via Docker

In the root directory of the repo you'll find a Docker compose file (docker-compose.yml) and an environment
variables configuration file (.env). Assuming you have Docker installed on your machine, you can stand up
FusionAuth up on your machine with:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start three containers, once each for FusionAuth, Postgres, and Elastic.

Here you are using a bootstrapping feature of FusionAuth, called [Kickstart](/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/kickstart).
When FusionAuth comes up for the first time, it will look at the `kickstart/kickstart.json` file and
configure FusionAuth to a certain initial state.

<Aside type="note">
If you ever want to reset the FusionAuth system, delete the volumes created by docker-compose by
executing `docker-compose down -v`, then re-run `docker-compose up -d`.
</Aside>

FusionAuth will be configured with these settings
* Your client Id is `e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e`.
* Your client secret is `2HYT86lWSAntc-mvtHLX5XXEpk9ThcqZb4YEh65CLjA-not-for-prod`.
* Your example username is `richard@example.com` and the password is `password`.
* Your admin username is `admin@example.com` and the password is `password`.
* The base URL of FusionAuth `http://localhost:9011/`.

You can log into the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin) and look around if you want, but with Docker/Kickstart you donâ€™t need to.

### Create a Basic Express.js Application

In this section, you'll set up a basic Golang application with a single page.

#### Setup Your Environment

Create a new directory to hold your application, and go into it.

```shell
mkdir changebank
cd changebank
```

To keep track of changes initialize your directory with git.

```shell
git init
```

Create a file called `.gitignore` so that you can exclude files from your git repo.

`.gitignore`
<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/.gitignore"}
  lang="text" />


Create a file called `package.json` with the below dependencies and scripts.

`package.json`
<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/package.json"}
  lang="json" />

Install dependencies using npm.

```shell
npm install
```

Create a new directory to hold your source code, and go into it.

```shell
mkdir src
cd src
```

#### Setup New Application via API

<Aside type="tip">
 Although you could also do all of this in the kickstart, this example is meant to show off how to use the SDK on the server for administrative purposes. You can do this even after instance is running unlike with a kickstart that needs to happen on a fresh install.
</Aside>

In this setup you will:

1. Update the Tenant's issuer to `http://localhost:9011`
1. Generate an RSA Key for the App
1. Create a new Application named `JSExampleApp` using the new RSA key.
1. Find the User with email `richard@example.com`
1. Update `richard@example.com`'s fullName property to `Richard Bray`
1. Register the User `Richard Bray` with the new application

Make sure you are still in the directory `complete-application/src`

Create a file called `setup.ts` with the below code.

`setup.ts`
<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/src/setup.ts"}
  lang="ts" />

Execute this setup by calling an npm script.

```shell
npm run setup
```

#### Create the Application
