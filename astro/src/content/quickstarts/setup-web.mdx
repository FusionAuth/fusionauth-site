Welcome! At the end of this guide, you will know how to add login (sign in) and logout (sign out) to a Node.js application, using Express and Pug.

If you haven't already done so, launch FusionAuth from one of the step 1 guides:

<BlogButton label="GitPod" href="/docs/quickstarts/launch-cloud" /><span class="mr-3" />
<BlogButton label="Docker" href="/docs/quickstarts/launch-docker" /><span class="mr-3" />
<BlogButton label="Local" href="/docs/quickstarts/launch-local" /><span class="mr-3" />

## Requirements

This guide uses Node.js and react.  To run the application, you need to have Node.js installed. This document has been tested with version 14 and 18, but should work with other versions.

```shell script title="Testing the Node.js Installation"
node -v
```

```shell script title="Result Of Testing the Node.js Installation"
v18.10.0
```

Install the modules for the application.  This assumes you are in the directory you used for the fusionapp install.

```shell script title="Install Node Modules for the Application"
cd complete-application
npm install
```

Here are steps to take to set up FusionAuth and configure it to provide login and logout functionality for your application.

- [1. Create User](#1-create-user)
- [2. Register User](#2-register-user)
- [3. Test the Application](#3-test-the-application)
- [4. Summing Up](#4-summing-up)

Let's get into the details of each step. 

## 1. Create User

<FirstStepsCreateUser />

## 2. Register User

<FirstStepsRegisterUser />

## 3. Test the Application

<FirstStepsTestApplication />

Afterwards, you can dig deeper into a number of areas.

## 4. Summing Up
