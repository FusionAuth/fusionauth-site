You've chosen to use the FusionAuth hosted sandbox for the setup guide.

This is the best option if you want to get up and running quickly or if you plan to use the SaaS version of FusionAuth but want to get going.

The sandbox also runs a licensed version of FusionAuth, so if you want to explore any of the [premium features](/docs/v1/tech/premium-features/) without paying, you can use it to do so.

<Aside type="caution">
The FusionAuth sandbox environment is useful for testing out FusionAuth functionality, but it is open to the world; anyone can view the user data stored there.

The system is also reset regularly to a standard configuration, wiping all the data. This typically occurs **nightly**.

**Please do not** use the sandbox for production.

**Please do not** put private data in the sandbox.

If you'd like to have your own private instance of FusionAuth in the cloud, managed by FusionAuth, [you can purchase hosting](/pricing).
