In this quickstart you are going to build an application with Python and Django, and integrate it with FusionAuth.
You'll be building it for [ChangeBank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkH-kD73QUM), a global leader in converting dollars into coins.
It'll have areas reserved for users who have logged in as well as public facing sections.

The docker compose file and source code for a complete application are available at
https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-django-web/. (todo - fusionauth fork this from https://github.com/RichardJECooke/fusionauth-quickstart-python-django-web)

## Prerequisites
For this Quickstart, you'll need:
* [Python3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or later.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com): The quickest way to start FusionAuth. (There are [other ways](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/)).

## General Architecture

While this sample application doesn't have login functionality without FusionAuth, a more typical integration will replace an existing login system with FusionAuth.

In that case, the system might look like this before FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginBefore alt={"Request flow during login before FusionAuth"}/>

The login flow will look like this after FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginAfter alt={"Request flow during login after FusionAuth"}/>

In general, you are introducing FusionAuth in order to normalize and consolidate user data. This helps make sure it is consistent and up-to-date as well as offloading your login security and functionality to FusionAuth.

## Getting Started
In this section, you'll get FusionAuth up and running and use Rails to create a new application.

### Clone the Code
First off, grab the code from the repository and change into that directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web
```

### Run FusionAuth via Docker
In the root directory of the repo you'll find a Docker compose file (docker-compose.yml) and an environment
variables configuration file (.env). Assuming you have Docker installed on your machine, you can stand up
FusionAuth up on your machine with:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start three containers, once each for FusionAuth, Postgres, and Elastic.

Here you are using a bootstrapping feature of FusionAuth, called [Kickstart](/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/kickstart).
When FusionAuth comes up for the first time, it will look at the `kickstart/kickstart.json` file and
configure FusionAuth to a certain initial state.

<Aside type="note">
If you ever want to reset the FusionAuth system, delete the volumes created by docker-compose by
executing `docker-compose down -v`, then re-run `docker-compose up -d`.
</Aside>

FusionAuth will be configured with these settings
* Your client Id is `e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e`.
* Your client secret is `super-secret-secret-that-should-be-regenerated-for-production`.
* Your example username is `richard@example.com` and the password is `password`.
* Your admin username is `admin@example.com` and the password is `password`.
* The base URL of FusionAuth `http://localhost:9011/`.

You can log into the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin) and look around if you want, but with Docker/Kickstart you donâ€™t need to.

### Create a Basic Flask Application
In this section, you'll set up a basic Flask application with a single page. While this section builds a simple
Python / Flask application, you can use the same method to integrate your existing application with FusionAuth.

#### Setup Your Environment
We recommend working in a virtual environment for this.

```shell
python3.8 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
```

Next, create a requirements.txt file to name the project dependencies.

`requirements.txt`
<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/requirements.txt"
 lang="python" />

And then install the dependencies into your virtual env.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Create the Application
Now create your Flask app, which for now will consist of an environment file named `.env` and a python file named `server.py`.

Create the environment file with these contents:

`.env`
<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/.env"
 lang="shell" />

In server.py, you'll add all of the imports you'll need, declare some constants, and initialize the OAuth library.

`server.py`
<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/server.py"
 lang="python"
 tags="baseApplication"/>

<Aside type="tip">
You should be able to start your Flask application with `flask --app server.py --debug run`.
Note that you won't be able to access it with a browser yet!
</Aside>

#### Create a Home Route and a Home Page
The next step is to get a basic home page up and running. This will require a back end route to handle requests to `/` and a web page template.

In the route function, you're going to look for an access token, which is created when a user is successfully authenticated. If the user
is not authenticated, you'll just take them to the home page. However, if they _are_ authenticated, you'll redirect them to
an `/account` page. Since we haven't implemented login yet, the redirect to `/account` won't work.

Add the route handling function to your server.py file.

`server.py`
<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/server.py"
 lang="python"
 tags="homeRoute"/>

Next, create the home page in a `templates` directory. This page just has a login button, which won't do anything yet. These commands also
install a CSS file and an image to make your app look nicer.

```shell
mkdir -p templates static/css static/img && \
wget -O templates/home.html https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/templates/home.html && \
wget -O static/css/changebank.css https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/static/css/changebank.css && \
wget -O static/img/money.jpg https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/static/img/money.jpg

```

<Aside type="tip">
With the home page and route complete, you can view the home page in your brower at `http://localhost:5000`.
</Aside>

## Authentication
In this section you'll build the integration with FusionAuth, which will allow users to log in to your application.

### Add OAuth Authentication Routes
Next, you'll add a `/login` route that uses authlib to take the user to FusionAuth's OAuth2 `authorize` endpoint,
and a `/callback` route that FusionAuth will redirect the user back to after a successful login.

FusionAuth will include an authorization code in the redirect to `/callback`, and the callback function will
make a server-to-server call to FusionAuth to exchange the authorization code for an access token, refresh token,
and userinfo object. All of this happens in `oauth.FusionAuth.authorize_access_token()`. This sequence of redirects and
back end calls is known as an OAuth Authorization Code Grant flow.

After your app gets the information back from FusionAuth, you'll write these items to HTTP-only cookies, so that they will
be returned to the Flask application on subsequent requests, but are not readable by code running in the browser.

We also set the userinfo object in the Flask session, to make it easy to use in rendered templates.

Add the `/login` and `/callback` routes to your server code.

`server.py`
<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/server.py"
 lang="python"
 tags="loginRoute"/>

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/server.py"
 lang="python"
 tags="callbackRoute"/>

<Aside type="tip">
Once these steps are done, you should be able to successfully log into your application! Just note that after logging
in, you're taking the user to `/account`, which doesn't exist yet.
</Aside>

### Add a Secured Page
Remember that after logging in, the application redirects the user to `/`, which then redirects a
logged in user to '/account'. You going to add that route and page now.

First, create the page template for a logged-in user. It's going to show a personalized header
and a logout button.

```shell
wget -O templates/account.html https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/templates/account.html
```

Next, create a route to get to that page. This checks if an access token is present.
If one isn't, it forces a logout at FusionAuth. If one is, it renders the `/account` page.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/server.py"
 lang="python"
 tags="accountRoute"/>

<Aside type="tip">
Now when you log in, you should see the `/account` page!
</Aside>

### Add Logout Support
The last step is to implement logout. When you log a user out of an application, you'll take them to
FusionAuth's `/oauth2/logout` endpoint. After logging the user out, FusionAuth will redirect the user
to your app's `/login` endpoint, which you'll create now. This endpoint deletes any cookies that your
application created, and clears the Flask session.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-python-flask-web/main/complete-application/server.py"
 lang="python"
 tags="logoutRoute"/>

<Aside type="tip">
Click the `Logout` button and watch the browser first go to FusionAuth to log out the user, then return to your home page.
</Aside>

## Next Steps
This quickstart is a great way to get a proof of concept up and running quickly, but to run
you application in production, there are some things you're going to want to do.

### FusionAuth Customization
FusionAuth gives you the ability to customize just about everything with the user's experience and your application's integration. This includes
* [Hosted pages](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/themes/) such as login, registration, email verification, and many more
* [Email templates](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/email-templates/email-templates)
* [User data and custom claims in access token JWTs](https://fusionauth.io/articles/tokens/jwt-components-explained)

### Security
* You may want to customize the [token expiration times and policies](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/oauth/#configure-application-oauth-settings) in FusionAuth
* Choose [password rules](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/tenants#password) and a [hashing algorithm](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/reference/password-hashes) that meet your security needs

### Tenant and Application Management
* Model your application topology using [Applications](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/applications), [Roles](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/roles), [Groups](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/groups), [Entities](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/groups), and more
* Set up [MFA](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/guides/multi-factor-authentication), [Social login](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers/), and/or [SAML](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers/samlv2/) integrations
* Integrate with external systems using [Webhooks](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/events-webhooks/), [SCIM](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/scim), and [Lambdas](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/lambdas/)
