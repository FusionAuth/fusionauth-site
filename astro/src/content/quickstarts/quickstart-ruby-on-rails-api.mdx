## Prerequisites

- [Ruby 2.7.x](https://rubyonrails.org/): This quickstart was built using Ruby 2.7. This example may work on different versions of Rails, but it has not been tested.
- [Rails 7.0.x.x](https://rubyonrails.org/): This quickstart was built using Rails 7.0.7.2. This example may work on different versions of Rails, but it has not been tested.
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html): This quickstart was built using sqlite3 (please note MacOS comes with sqlite3).
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com): The quickest way to stand up FusionAuth. Ensure you also have [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.
- (Alternatively, you can [Install FusionAuth Manually](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/)).

## General Architecture

<LoginArchitectureApi />

## Getting Started

In this section, youâ€™ll get FusionAuth up and running and create a resource server which will serve the API.

### Clone The Code

First off, grab the code from the repository and change into that directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-api
cd fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-api
```

### Run FusionAuth Via Docker

<DockerSpinup kickstartUri={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} api />

## Create Your Ruby on Rails Resource Server Application

Now you are going to create a Ruby on Rails API application. While this section builds a simple API, you can use the same configuration to integrate an existing API with FusionAuth.

We are going to be building an API backend for a banking application called ChangeBank. This API will have two endpoints:
- `make-change`: This endpoint will allow you to call GET with a `total` amount and receive a response indicating how many nickels and pennies are needed to make change. Valid roles are `customer` and `teller`.
- `panic`: Tellers may call this endpoint to call the police in case of an incident. The only valid role is `teller`.

Both endpoints will be protected such that a valid JSON web token (JWT) will be required in the `Authorization` header in order to be accessed. Additionally, the JWT must have a `roles` claim containing the appropriate role to use the endpoint.

<Aside type="note">
If you simply want to run the application , there is a completed version in the 'complete-application' directory. You can use the following commands to get it up and running if you do not want to create your own.

```shell
cd complete-application
bundle install
bundle e rails s -p 4001
```

You can then follow the instructions in the [Run the API](#run-the-api) section started at Get a Token.
</Aside>

### Initialize The Application

Initialize the Ruby on Rails application using the following:

```
rails new your-application --api
cd your-application
```

Once this is complete, you will see a new directory called `your-application` with several sub directories.

You need to add the following lines to the `Gemfile` in the application root directory to include two new dependencies:

```shell
gem 'rack-jwt', git: 'https://github.com/FusionAuth/rack-jwt'
gem 'dotenv-rails'
```

Your full `Gemfile` will now look like

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/Gemfile"}
  lang="text"/>

Then, install these new gems, by issuing the following command in your terminal window.

```shell
bundle install
```
### Update Routes Config

Update `/config/routes.rb` to include the two new routes that will be created for `/make-change` and `/panic`. Your `routes.rb` file should now match the below code.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/config/routes.rb"}
  lang="ruby"/>

### Add Security

Create a new file to hold your environment variables directly in the `your-application` directory called `.env.development`. You will need to add two variables that are used to call your FusionAuth instance `FUSIONAUTH_LOCATION` and `CLIENT_ID`, with the values that match below.

```
# for rails

FUSIONAUTH_LOCATION=http://localhost:9011

CLIENT_ID=e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e
```

Utilizing the environment variables you just added, you can now setup JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication. Create a new file  `config/initializers/jwt_rack.rb`. This initializer is used to hold configuration settings that are made after all of the frameworks and plugins are loaded. 

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/config/initializers/jwt_rack.rb"}
  lang="ruby"/>

Having this code protects your endpoints from anonymous users and passes the JWT payload to the controller. The JWT payload includes `roles` encoded in the JWT you receive from FusionAuth. The decoded payload of a JWT for a `teller` might look like this:

```json
{
  "aud": "e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e",
  "exp": 1689289585,
  "iat": 1689285985,
  "iss": "http://localhost:9011",
  "sub": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-111111111111",
  "jti": "ebaa4184-2320-47dd-925b-2e18756c635f",
  "authenticationType": "PASSWORD",
  "email": "teller@example.com",
  "email_verified": true,
  "applicationId": "e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e",
  "roles": [
    "teller"
  ],
  "auth_time": 1689285985,
  "tid": "d7d09513-a3f5-401c-9685-34ab6c552453"
}
```

### Add Controllers

Create a new file for the MakeChangeController `app/controllers/make_change_controller.rb`. This controller will verify that the authenticated user has either the `teller` or `customer` role. It then takes in the URL parameter `total` to calculate which coins will be returned in the JSON payload.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/app/controllers/make_change_controller.rb"}
  lang="ruby"/>

Create a new file for the PanicController `app/controllers/panic_controller.rb`. This controller will verify that the authenticated user has only the `teller` role. It will respond with `Proper role not found for user.` if this role is not found. This route also verifies that this is a `POST` request and if this is not true it will respond with `Only POST method is supported.` If both of these tests are passed the controller will return a successful message of `We've called the police!`.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/app/controllers/panic_controller.rb"}
  lang="ruby"/>

## Run the API

Start the API resource server by running:

In a command shell window, navigate to the root directory of your application and run the following command to start the server.

```shell
bundle e rails s -p 4001
```

### Get a Token

There are [several ways to acquire a token](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/) in FusionAuth, but for this example you will use the [Login API](/docs/apis/login) to keep things simple.

<Aside type="note">
You will want to leave the server running in one terminal and open another terminal for the following commands.
</Aside>

First let's try the requests as the `teller@example.com` user. Based on the configuration this user has the `teller` role and should be able to use both `/make-change` and `/panic`.

Acquire an access token for `teller@example` by making the following request

```shell
curl --location 'http://localhost:9011/api/login' \
--header 'Authorization: this_really_should_be_a_long_random_alphanumeric_value_but_this_still_works' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "loginId": "teller@example.com",
  "password": "password",
  "applicationId": "e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e"
}'
```
Your response should look like the below JSON. Grab the token field (which begins with ey).

```json
{
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6InVOYl9iQzFySHZZTnZMc285VzRkOEprZkxLWSJ9.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.WLzI9hSsCDn3ZoHKA9gaifkd6ASjT03JUmROGFZaezz9xfVbO3quJXEpUpI3poLozYxVcj2hrxKpNT9b7Sp16CUahev5tM0-4_FaYlmUEoMZBKo2JRSH8hg-qVDvnpeu8nL6FXxJII0IK4FNVwrQVFmAz99ZCf7m5xruQSziXPrfDYSU-3OZJ3SRuvD8bMopSiyRvZLx6YjWfBsvGSmMXeh_8vHG5fVkq5w1IkaDdugHnivtJIivHuCfl38kQBgw9rAqJLJoKRHHW0Ha7vHIcS6OCWWMDIIVspLyQNcLC16pL9Nss_5v9HMofow1OvQ9sUSMrbbkipjKq2peSjG7qA",
    "tokenExpirationInstant": 1689353059670,
    "user": {
        ...
    }
}
```

### Make the Request

<Aside type="note">
The code is set up to extract the token from either a cookie or the Authorization header so depending on your preference you can replace `--cookie 'app.at=<your_token>'` with `--header 'Authorization: Bearer <your_token>'` when making requests to the API.
</Aside>

Make a request to `/make-change` with a query parameter `total=1.02`. Use the `token` as the `app.at` cookie.

```shell
curl 'http://localhost:4001/make-change?total=1.02' \
--cookie 'app.at=<your_token>'
```

Alternatively you can make the same request by passing your token in the `Authorization` header.

```shell
curl --location 'http://localhost:4001/make-change?total=1.02' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <your_token>'
```

Your response should look like this:

```json
{
  "Message": "We can make change using 20 quarters 1 dimes 0 nickels 2 pennies",
  "Change": [
    {
      "Denomination": "quarters",
      "Count": 20
    },
    {
      "Denomination": "dimes",
      "Count": 1
    },
    {
      "Denomination": "nickels",
      "Count": 0
    },
    {
      "Denomination": "pennies",
      "Count": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

You were authorized, success! You can try making the request without the `--cookie` or with a different string rather than a valid token, and see that you are denied access.

Next call the `/panic` endpoint because you are in trouble!

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:4001/panic' \
--cookie 'app.at=<your_token>'
```

This is a `POST` not a `GET` because you want all your emergency calls to be non-idempotent.

Your response should look like this:

```json
{"message":"We've called the police!"}
```

Nice, help is on the way!

Now let's try as `customer@example.com` who has the role `customer`. Acquire a token for `customer@example.com`.

```shell
curl --location 'http://localhost:9011/api/login' \
--header 'Authorization: this_really_should_be_a_long_random_alphanumeric_value_but_this_still_works' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "loginId": "customer@example.com",
  "password": "password",
  "applicationId": "e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e"
}'
```

Your response should look like the below JSON. Grab the token field (which begins with ey).

```json
{
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6InVOYl9iQzFySHZZTnZMc285VzRkOEprZkxLWSJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJlOWZkYjk4NS05MTczLTRlMDEtOWQ3My1hYzJkNjBkMWRjOGUiLCJleHAiOjE2ODkzNTQxMjMsImlhdCI6MTY4OTM1MzUyMywiaXNzIjoiaHR0cDovL2xvY2FsaG9zdDo5MDExIiwic3ViIjoiMDAwMDAwMDAtMDAwMC0wMDAwLTAwMDAtMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyIiwianRpIjoiYjc2YWMwMGMtMDdmNi00NzkzLTgzMjgtODM4M2M3MGU4MWUzIiwiYXV0aGVudGljYXRpb25UeXBlIjoiUEFTU1dPUkQiLCJlbWFpbCI6ImN1c3RvbWVyQGV4YW1wbGUuY29tIiwiZW1haWxfdmVyaWZpZWQiOnRydWUsImFwcGxpY2F0aW9uSWQiOiJlOWZkYjk4NS05MTczLTRlMDEtOWQ3My1hYzJkNjBkMWRjOGUiLCJyb2xlcyI6WyJjdXN0b21lciJdLCJhdXRoX3RpbWUiOjE2ODkzNTM1MjMsInRpZCI6ImQ3ZDA5NTEzLWEzZjUtNDAxYy05Njg1LTM0YWI2YzU1MjQ1MyJ9.T1bELQ6a_ItOS0_YYpvqhIVknVMNeamcoC7BWnPjg2lgA9XpCmFA2mVnycoeuz-mSOHbp2cCoauP5opxehBR2lCn4Sz0If6PqgJgXKEpxh5pAxCPt91UyfjH8hGDqE3rDh7E4Hqn7mb-dFFwdfX7CMdKvC3dppMbXAGCZTl0LizApw5KIG9Wmt670339pSf5lzD38P9WAG5Wr7fAmVrIJPVu6yv2FoR-pMYD2lnAF63HWKknrWB-khmhr9ZKRLXKhP1UK-ThY1FSnmpp8eNblsBqCxf6WaYxYkdp5_F2e56M4sQwHzrg4P9tZGVCmMri4dShF3Ck7OGa7hel-iIPew",
    "tokenExpirationInstant": 1689354123118,
    "user": {
        ...
    }
}
```

Now use that token to call `/make-change` with a query parameter `total=3.24`

```shell
curl --location 'http://localhost:4001/make-change?total=3.24' \
--cookie 'app.at=<your_token>'
```

Your response should look like this:

```json
{
    "Message": "We can make change using 12 quarters 2 dimes 0 nickels 4 pennies",
    "Change": [
        {
            "Denomination": "quarters",
            "Count": 12
        },
        {
            "Denomination": "dimes",
            "Count": 2
        },
        {
            "Denomination": "nickels",
            "Count": 0
        },
        {
            "Denomination": "pennies",
            "Count": 4
        }
    ]
}
```

So far so good. Now let's try to call the `/panic` endpoint. (We're adding the `-i` flag to see the headers of the response)

```shell
curl -i --request POST 'http://localhost:4001/panic' \
--cookie 'app.at=<your_token>'
```

You will get a `401 Unauthorized` response with the following message.

```json
{"message":"Proper role not found for user"}
```

Uh oh, I guess you are not allowed to do that.

Enjoy your secured resource server!

## Next Steps

<NextStepsApi />

## Troubleshooting

* I get `This site canâ€™t be reached localhost refused to connect.` when I call the Login API.

Ensure FusionAuth is running in the Docker container. You should be able to login as the admin user, `admin@example.com` with a password of `password` at [http://localhost:9011/admin](http://localhost:9011/admin).

* The `/panic` endpoint doesn't work when I call it.

Make sure you are making a `POST` call and using a token with the `teller` role.

* It still doesn't work

You can always pull down a complete running application and compare what's different.

```
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-api.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-api
docker compose up -d
cd complete-application
