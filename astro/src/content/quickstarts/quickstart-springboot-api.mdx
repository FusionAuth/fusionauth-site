In this tutorial, you are going to learn how to integrate a Java Spring Boot resource server with FusionAuth. You will protect an API resource from unauthorized usage. You'll be building it for [ChangeBank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXDxNCzUspM), a global leader in converting dollars into coins.

The docker compose file and source code for a complete application are available at https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-springboot-api.

## Prerequisites

<SpringBootPreReqs/>

## General Architecture

A client wants access to an API resource at `/resource`. However, it is denied this resource until it acquires an access token from FusionAuth.

<Diagram />

While the access token is acquired via the Login API above, this is for simplicity of illustration. The token can be, and typically is, acquired through one of the [OAuth grants](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/).

## Getting Started

In this section, you’ll get FusionAuth up and running and create a resource server which will serve the API.

### Clone The Code

First off, grab the code from the repository and change into that directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-springboot-api.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-springboot-api
```

### Run FusionAuth Via Docker

In the root directory of the repo you’ll find a Docker compose file (docker-compose.yml) and an environment variables configuration file (.env). Assuming you have Docker installed on your machine, you can stand up FusionAuth up on your machine with:

```
docker compose up -d
```

Here you are using a bootstrapping feature of FusionAuth, called [Kickstart](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/kickstart). When FusionAuth comes up for the first time, it will look at the `kickstart/kickstart.json` file and configure FusionAuth to a certain initial state.

<Aside type="note">
If you ever want to reset the FusionAuth system, delete the volumes created by docker-compose by executing `docker-compose down -v`, then re-run `docker-compose up -d`.
</Aside>

FusionAuth will be initially configured with these settings:

* Your client Id is: `e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e`
* Your client secret is: `super-secret-secret-that-should-be-regenerated-for-production`
* Your example teller username is `teller@example.com` and your password is `password`. They will have the role `teller`.
* Your example customer username is `customer@example.com` and your password is `password`. They will have the role `customer`.
* Your admin username is `admin@example.com` and your password is `password`.
* Your fusionAuthBaseUrl is 'http://localhost:9011/'

You can log into the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin) and look around if you want, but with Docker/Kickstart you don't need to.

## Create Your Spring Boot Resource Server Application

Now you are going to create a Spring Boot API application. While this section builds a simple API, you can use the same configuration to integrate an existing API with FusionAuth.

We are going to be building an API backend for a banking application called ChangeBank. This API will have two endpoints:
- `make-change`: This endpoint will allow you to call GET with a `total` amount and receive a response indicating how many nickels and pennies are needed to make change. Valid roles are `customer` and `teller`.
- `panic`: Tellers may call this endpoint to call the police in case of an incident. The only valid role is `teller`.

Both endpoints will be protected such that a valid JSON web token (JWT) will be required in the `Authorization` header in order to be accessed. Additionally, the JWT must have a `roles` claim containing the appropriate role to use the endpoint.

Make a directory for this API. 

```
mkdir spring-api && cd spring-api
```

### Get The Template

<a href='https://start.spring.io/' target='_blank'>Go to the Initializr site</a> and download your own starter package. You will rely on two dependencies for this project:

- OAuth2 Resource Server
- Spring Web

This example uses:

* Maven
* Spring Boot version `3.1.1`
* Java 17
* A `Group` of `io.fusionauth.quickstart`.
* A `Name` of `FusionAuthQuickstart`.
* An `Artifact` of `springapi`.

If you choose different options, the configuration and code may be different.

Download and unzip the package into the `spring-api` directory. 

```
mv /path/to/downloads/springapi.zip .
unzip springapi.zip
mv springapi/* .
mv springapi/.* .
rm springapi.zip
rmdir springapi
```

### Install the Dependencies

```shell
./mvnw package
```
<Aside type="note">If you are on Windows substitute `./mvnw` with `.\mvnw.cmd`</Aside>

### Configure the Spring Application Properties

Open `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-springboot-api/main/complete-application/src/main/resources/application.properties"
            lang="ini"/>

We need two properties here:
- `spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri` - This is set to the location of FusionAuth. Spring will call the `OpenID Connect Discovery` endpoint which can be found under the details view for the Example Application in the [Applications View](http://localhost:9011/admin/application/) in the FusionAuth admin app. This endpoint allows Spring to look up all the OAuth metadata that it needs to validate tokens created by FusionAuth.
- `spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.audiences` - This is a list of the application ids in FusionAuth allowed for this resource server. FusionAuth will populate this in the `aud` claim of the JWTs and you will use that claim to validate that the token is intended for this resource server.

If you are using the kickstart the OAuth metadata URL will be `http://localhost:9011/.well-known/openid-configuration/d7d09513-a3f5-401c-9685-34ab6c552453`.

### Write Java Code

Now you are going to write some Java code. You are going to write two API controllers, their corresponding model objects and some Spring configuration.

This tutorial puts all these classes in the same package for simplicity, but for a production application, you'd separate these out.

### Add Model Objects

We will need response objects for the API to return. One is the `PanicResponse` which returns a message when a successful `POST` call is made to `/panic`. In the base package create a new class `PanicResponse.java`.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-springboot-api/main/complete-application/src/main/java/io/fusionauth/quickstart/springapi/PanicResponse.java"
            lang="java"/>

Next you need an object to show the breakdown from making change. This object will hold a BigDecimal `total` and Integers `nickels` and `pennies`. In the base package create a new class `Change.java`.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-springboot-api/main/complete-application/src/main/java/io/fusionauth/quickstart/springapi/Change.java"
            lang="java"/>

### Add Controllers

Next you need to add controllers to handle API calls. In the base package add a new class `MakeChangeController.java`.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-springboot-api/main/complete-application/src/main/java/io/fusionauth/quickstart/springapi/MakeChangeController.java"
            lang="java" />

In this class a `total` is a http request query parameter that is converted to a `BigDecimal`, and the `get` method divides the `total` into `nickels` and `pennies` and returns the response object.

There are three annotations that are important for the controller to work:
 - `@RestController` tells Spring this is a `Controller` that returns a `ResponseBody`
 - `@RequestMapping` tells Spring which path this controller responds to
 - `@GetMapping` tells Spring this method handles GET requests

Now, add a controller for tellers to call in an emergency. In the base package add a class `PanicController.java`.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-springboot-api/main/complete-application/src/main/java/io/fusionauth/quickstart/springapi/PanicController.java"
            lang="java" />

This class listens on `/panic` for a POST request and returns a response indicating that the police were called. The annotations are the same as `MakeChangeController.java` except for `@PostMapping` indicates a POST request handler.

### Add Security

So far you have not done anything with auth, and the controllers are unaware of authentication at all. Now, you'll protect your endpoints based on the `roles` encoded in the JWT you receive from FusionAuth. The decoded payload of a JWT for a `teller` might look like this:

```json
{
  "aud": "e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e",
  "exp": 1689289585,
  "iat": 1689285985,
  "iss": "http://localhost:9011",
  "sub": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-111111111111",
  "jti": "ebaa4184-2320-47dd-925b-2e18756c635f",
  "authenticationType": "PASSWORD",
  "email": "teller@example.com",
  "email_verified": true,
  "applicationId": "e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e",
  "roles": [
    "teller"
  ],
  "auth_time": 1689285985,
  "tid": "d7d09513-a3f5-401c-9685-34ab6c552453"
}
```

You need to tell Spring how to parse the `roles` out of the claim in the JWT, and for that you need a `Converter`. In the base package add a class `CustomJwtAuthenticationConverter.java`:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-springboot-api/main/complete-application/src/main/java/io/fusionauth/quickstart/springapi/CustomJwtAuthenticationConverter.java"
            lang="java" />

This class implements the `Converter` interface and takes the `roles` claim and maps it to a `Collection<GrantedAuthority>` Spring will use to authorize the user. We set these as the `authorities` on the AuthenticationToken.

Because you are using a custom converter you also need to check the audience. Pull out the `aud` claim and validate that at least one of them is in the list of configured audiences for this application.

Now you can add a security configuration. In the base package create a new class `SecurityConfiguration.java`.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-springboot-api/main/complete-application/src/main/java/io/fusionauth/quickstart/springapi/SecurityConfiguration.java"
            lang="java" />

This class does a lot in a few lines of code. Let's break it down:
- `@Configuration` tells spring to autowire this configuration class and `@Bean` wires the `SecurityFilterChain` which will add the rules for handling the security on http requests.
- `OAuth2ResourceServerProperties` is injected into the configuration bean and holds the values you defined in the `application.properties` file.
- In the `SecurityFilterChain` you do the following:
  1. Get `audiences` list from the `OAuth2ResourceServerProperties`
  2. Create a new instance of `CustomJwtAuthenticationConverter` and pass it the `audiences` list
  3. Tell the filter chain that any requests to `/make-change` must have the `customer` or `teller` role defined in the `GrantedAuthority` list you extract from the JWT.
  4. Tell the filter chain that any requests to `/panic` must have the `teller` role defined in the `GrantedAuthority` list you extract from the JWT.
  5. Set the `oauth2ResourceServer` configuration to use the `CustomJwtAuthenticationConverter` you defined above.
- `JwtDecoder` this bean tells spring to decode the JWT in the request using the information from the `issuer` you defined in the properties file.

<Aside type="note">The `NimbusJwtDecoder` will automatically check that the token is not expired based on the `exp` claim.</Aside>

## Run the API

Start the API resource server by running:

```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### Get a Token

There are [several ways to acquire a token](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/) in FusionAuth, but for this example you will use the [Login API](/docs/apis/login) to keep things simple.

First let's try the requests as the `teller@example.com` user. Based on the configuration this user has the `teller` role and should be able to use both `/make-change` and `/panic`.

1. Acquire an access token for `teller@example` by making the following request

```shell
curl --location 'http://localhost:9011/api/login' \
--header 'Authorization: this_really_should_be_a_long_random_alphanumeric_value_but_this_still_works' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "loginId": "teller@example.com",
  "password": "password",
  "applicationId": "e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e"
}'
```
Copy the `token` from the response, which should look like this:

```json
{
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6InVOYl9iQzFySHZZTnZMc285VzRkOEprZkxLWSJ9.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.WLzI9hSsCDn3ZoHKA9gaifkd6ASjT03JUmROGFZaezz9xfVbO3quJXEpUpI3poLozYxVcj2hrxKpNT9b7Sp16CUahev5tM0-4_FaYlmUEoMZBKo2JRSH8hg-qVDvnpeu8nL6FXxJII0IK4FNVwrQVFmAz99ZCf7m5xruQSziXPrfDYSU-3OZJ3SRuvD8bMopSiyRvZLx6YjWfBsvGSmMXeh_8vHG5fVkq5w1IkaDdugHnivtJIivHuCfl38kQBgw9rAqJLJoKRHHW0Ha7vHIcS6OCWWMDIIVspLyQNcLC16pL9Nss_5v9HMofow1OvQ9sUSMrbbkipjKq2peSjG7qA",
    "tokenExpirationInstant": 1689353059670,
    "user": {
        ...
    }
}
```

### Make the Request

Use the `token` as a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header. Make a request to `/make-change` with a query parameter `total=5.12`.

```shell
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/make-change?total=5.12' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <your_token>'
```

Your response should look like this:

```json
{
    "total": 5.12,
    "nickels": 102,
    "pennies": 2
}
```

You were authorized, success! You can try making the request without the `Authorization` header or with a different string rather than a valid token, and see that you are denied access.

Next call the `/panic` endpoint because you are in trouble!

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/panic' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <your_token>'
```

This is a `POST` not a get because you want all your emergency calls to be non-idempotent.

Your response should look like this:

```shell
{
    "message": "We've called the police!"
}
```

Nice, help is on the way!

Now let's try as `customer@example.com` who has the role `customer`. Acquire a token for `customer@example.com`.

```shell
curl --location 'http://localhost:9011/api/login' \
--header 'Authorization: this_really_should_be_a_long_random_alphanumeric_value_but_this_still_works' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "loginId": "customer@example.com",
  "password": "password",
  "applicationId": "e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e"
}'
```

Your response should look like this:

```json
{
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6InVOYl9iQzFySHZZTnZMc285VzRkOEprZkxLWSJ9.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.T1bELQ6a_ItOS0_YYpvqhIVknVMNeamcoC7BWnPjg2lgA9XpCmFA2mVnycoeuz-mSOHbp2cCoauP5opxehBR2lCn4Sz0If6PqgJgXKEpxh5pAxCPt91UyfjH8hGDqE3rDh7E4Hqn7mb-dFFwdfX7CMdKvC3dppMbXAGCZTl0LizApw5KIG9Wmt670339pSf5lzD38P9WAG5Wr7fAmVrIJPVu6yv2FoR-pMYD2lnAF63HWKknrWB-khmhr9ZKRLXKhP1UK-ThY1FSnmpp8eNblsBqCxf6WaYxYkdp5_F2e56M4sQwHzrg4P9tZGVCmMri4dShF3Ck7OGa7hel-iIPew",
    "tokenExpirationInstant": 1689354123118,
    "user": {
        ...
    }
}
```

Now use that token to call `/make-change` with a query parameter `total=3.24`

```shell
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/make-change?total=3.24' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <your_token>'
```

Your response should look like this:

```json
{
    "total": 3.24,
    "nickels": 64,
    "pennies": 4
}
```

So far so good. Now let's try to call the `/panic` endpoint. (We're adding the `-i` flag to see the headers of the response)

```shell
curl -i --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/panic' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <your_token>'
```

Your response should look like:

```shell
HTTP/1.1 403
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 0
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: 0
X-Frame-Options: DENY
Content-Length: 0
Date: Fri, 14 Jul 2023 16:59:28 GMT
```

Uh oh, I guess you are not allowed to do that.

Enjoy your secured resource server!

## Next Steps

This quickstart is a great way to get a proof of concept up and running quickly, but to run your API in production, there are some things you're going to want to do.

### FusionAuth Integration

* Rather than call the Login API, you're probably going to want to use the [Authorization Code grant](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/#example-authorization-code-grant), which keeps all sensitive credentials within the bounds of FusionAuth. You can customize the [hosted login pages](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/).
* You may want to generate a token using the [Client Credentials grant](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/#example-client-credentials-grant) if you are calling the API from another service.

### Security
* Customize the [token expiration times and policies](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/#configure-application-oauth-settings) in FusionAuth
* [Make sure you know how to securely consume a token](/articles/tokens/building-a-secure-jwt#consuming-a-jwt)
* Secure your API [using an API gateway](/docs/extend/examples/api-gateways/) rather than at the framework layer.

## Troubleshooting

* I get `This site can’t be reached  localhost refused to connect.` when I call the Login API.

Ensure FusionAuth is running in the Docker container.  You should be able to login as the admin user, `admin@example.com` with a password of `password` at [http://localhost:9011/admin](http://localhost:9011/admin).

* The `/panic` endpoint doesn't work when I call it.

Make sure you are making a `POST` call and using a token with the `teller` role.

* I'm getting an error when running `./mvnw spring-boot:run` like this:

```
org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'filterChain' defined in class path resource [io/fusionauth/quickstart/springapi/SecurityConfiguration.class]: Failed to instantiate [org.springframework.security.web.SecurityFilterChain]: Factory method 'filterChain' threw exception with message: Error creating bean with name 'jwtDecoder' defined in class path resource [io/fusionauth/quickstart/springapi/SecurityConfiguration.class]: Failed to instantiate [org.springframework.security.oauth2.jwt.JwtDecoder]: Factory method 'jwtDecoder' threw exception with message: Cannot invoke "String.length()" because "this.input" is null
```

Make sure you set up the `application.properties` file correctly.

* I'm getting an error when running `./mvnw spring-boot:run` like this:

```
[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------------
[ERROR] COMPILATION ERROR : 
[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------------
[ERROR] /path/fusionauth-quickstart-springboot-api/spring-api/src/main/java/io/fusionauth/quickstart/springapi/CustomJwtAuthenticationConverter.java:[4,51] package org.springframework.security.authentication does not exist
[ERROR] /path/fusionauth-quickstart-springboot-api/spring-api/src/main/java/io/fusionauth/quickstart/springapi/CustomJwtAuthenticationConverter.java:[5,51] package org.springframework.security.authentication does not exist
```

Make sure you requested the two required dependencies when you used the Initializr.

* It still doesn't work

You can always pull down a complete running application and compare what's different.

```
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-spring-api.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-spring-api
docker-compose up -d
cd complete-app
./mvnw package spring-boot:run
```
