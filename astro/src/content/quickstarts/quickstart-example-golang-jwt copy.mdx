# Go JWT Examples

This code uses the go jwt library: https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt and runs through a couple of different scenarios.

* building a JWT with the 'hmac' algorithm
* building a JWT with the 'rsa' algorithm
* building a JWT with the 'hmac' algorithm but verifying additional claims
* decoding an invalid JWT with the 'hmac' algorithm
* decoding a JWT with the 'hmac' algorithm and the wrong key
* re-issuing an 'rsa' signed JWT with an 'hmac' algorithm
