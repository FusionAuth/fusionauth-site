## Prerequisites

- [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download): This is the framework needed to run .NET applications. This app has been tested with .NET 7.0.7. This example should work with future compatible versions of .NET.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com): The quickest way to stand up FusionAuth. (There are [other ways](/docs/get-started/download-and-install)).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download): The editor for making changes to code. (You can use other editors as well.)

## General Architecture

<LoginArchitectureWeb />

## Getting Started

In this section, you'll get FusionAuth up and running and use .NET to create a new application.

### Clone the Code

First off, grab the code from the repository and change into that directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-dotnet-web.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-dotnet-web
```

### Run FusionAuth via Docker

<DockerSpinup kickstartUri={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} />

### Create your .NET 7 Application

Now you are going to create a .NET application using C#. While this section builds a simple .NET web application, you can use the same configuration to integrate your existing .NET application with FusionAuth.

You'll use [Razor Pages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio) and .NET 7. This application will display common information to all users. There will also be a secured area, only available to an authenticated user. The [full source code](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-dotnet-web) is available if you want to download it and take a look.

<Aside type="note">
If you simply want to run the application , there is a completed version in the 'complete-application' directory. You can use the following commands to get it up and running if you do not want to create your own.

```shell
cd complete-application
dotnet run
```

Then view the website at the following location `http://localhost:5000`.
</Aside>

To get started building your own application, open your command-line shell (i.e. Terminal on a Mac or PowerShell on Windows) and navigate to the directory of your choice. Then create a new web application using the `dotnet` CLI and go to that directory:

```shell
dotnet new webapp -o your-application
cd your-application
```

<Aside type="note">
Creating a new application in Visual Studio will work as well. You will use the command line here for the simplicity of the example.
</Aside>

Once the application has been created, you can start up the web application using the following command in.

```shell
dotnet run
```

The output should look similar to the following.

```shell
Building...
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
      Now listening on: http://localhost:5146
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Hosting environment: Development
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Content root path: /Users/Shared/your-application
```

The application will be accessible in your browser at `http://localhost:{PortNumber}` where the port number will be displayed in your shell window, i.e `http://localhost:5146`.

Press Control+C in the terminal window to stop the application from running.

## Authentication

It's always smart to leverage existing libraries as they are likely to be more secure and better handle edge cases. You're going to add an `OpenIdConnect` library to the application. In your terminal window, make sure you're in the root directory for your application and run the command below to add the library.

```shell
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect
```

This application will contain two pages that require authorization. The `Account` page will display the user's balance and the `MakeChange` page will make change for the user. To protect these pages you can use the [Authorize filter attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/filter?view=aspnetcore-3.1#authorize-filter-attribute) in the [page model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio).

Create `Account.cshtml` and `Account.cshtml.cs` in the `Pages` directory. To protect the "Account" page you can use the [Authorize filter attribute](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/filter?view=aspnetcore-7.0#authorize-filter-attribute) in the [page model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio).

Copy the following code into `Account.cshtml.cs`:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/Pages/Account.cshtml.cs"}
  lang="c#" />

Copy the following code into `Account.cshtml`:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/Pages/Account.cshtml"}
  lang="razor" />

Create `MakeChange.cshtml` and `MakeChange.cshtml.cs` in the `Pages` directory. You will use the same [Authorize filter attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/filter?view=aspnetcore-3.1#authorize-filter-attribute) to secure the page.

Copy the following code into `MakeChange.cshtml.cs`:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/Pages/MakeChange.cshtml.cs"}
  lang="c#" />

Copy the following code into `MakeChange.cshtml`:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/Pages/MakeChange.cshtml"}
  lang="razor" />

You will need a way to allow the user to logout of the application as well. You'll build the logout functionality in the `Logout` page. This will:

- Remove the session cookie.
- Redirect to the FusionAuth OAuth logout endpoint.

FusionAuth will then destroy its session and redirect the user back to the app's configured logout URL.

Add the following file to the `Pages` directory and call it `Logout.cshtml.cs`:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/Pages/Logout.cshtml.cs"}
  lang="c#" />

`OnGet` is the important method. Here you sign out using a method of the authentication library, delete the JWT cookie, and send the user to the FusionAuth OAuth logout endpoint.

Now add `Logout.cshtml` to the `Pages` directory. No content is necessary. Just declare the page and model as shown below.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/Pages/Logout.cshtml"}
  lang="razor" />

### Application Configuration
You will need to do a little plumbing to ensure things like having the correct settings and configuring the cookies properly to work over HTTP for the sample application.

#### App Settings
Replace the text in the `appsettings.json` file with the text below. The important part here is that we are adding the `FusionAuthSettings` section so that the code above will run with the correct configuration settings. `Authority` is just the location of the user identity server, in this case, FusionAuth. `Urls` ensures the application runs on the specified port, 5000.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/appsettings.json"}
  lang="json" />

#### Program Settings
Replace the text in the `Program.cs` file. Since you are using unsecured cookies, you need to allow this in the configuration. Safari and Chrome require different settings and that is reflected in the code below.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/Program.cs"}
  lang="c#" />

#### Startup Settings
Add the `Startup.cs` file in the root directory of the application. This sets the correct port and manages unsecured cookies for the browsers. The `CheckSameSite` and `DisallowsSameSiteNone` functions help manage the cookie settings for the different browsers.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/Startup.cs"}
  lang="c#" />

<Aside type="caution">
There are a few settings applied to simplify the sample application. In a production application, do not allow cookies over `http` or keep the `ClientSecret` in a .json file for production applications. Get the `ClientSecret` from an environmental variable that has been set on a production machine or some other secure way.
</Aside>

#### Navigation
This application will display different menu items for authenticated users and non authenticated users. To add this type of navigation update `/Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` with the following:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml"}
  lang="razor" />

#### Homepage
Update the default page.

Copy the following code into `Pages/Index.cshtml.cs`:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/Pages/Index.cshtml.cs"}
  lang="c#" />

Copy the following code into `Index.cshtml` and notice the logic to show a different view to users that have not logged in.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/Pages/Index.cshtml"}
  lang="razor" />

#### Styling
To give the pages the look and feel of an application, apply the following styling and images.

Add the `changebank.css` file in the `wwwroot/css` directory of the application.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/wwwroot/css/changebank.css"}
  lang="css" />

Copy the money image for the `Index` page. Run the following command in a terminal window. Make sure you are in the root directory for your application.

```shell
curl --create-dirs --output wwwroot/img/money.jpg https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/app/assets/images/money.jpg
```

#### A Little Clean Up
Next we need to do a little clean up and make sure all the namespaces work together in the application.

Replace the text in the `Pages/_ViewImports.cshtml` file with the following code.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/Pages/_ViewImports.cshtml"}
  lang="c#" />

Replace the text in the `Pages/Error.cshtml.cs` file with the following code.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/Pages/Error.cshtml.cs"}
  lang="c#" />

Replace the text in the `Pages/Privacy.cshtml.cs` file with the following code.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/Pages/Privacy.cshtml.cs"}
  lang="c#" />

## Run The Application

You can start up the {frontmatter.technology} application using this command in a terminal window from the root directory of your application:

```shell
dotnet run
```

You can now open up an incognito window and visit the app at http://localhost:5000. Log in with the user account you created when setting up FusionAuth, and you’ll see the email of the user next to a logout button.

  </Fragment>
</NextSteps>

## Troubleshooting

If you run into an issue with cookies on Safari or other browsers, you might need to run the .NET application under SSL.

You can follow [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/additional-tools/self-signed-certificates-guide) to install development SSL certificates for your .NET environment.

Alternatively, you can run the project using [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com), which will run the project using SSL.

If you do this, make sure to update the `Authorized Redirect URL` to reflect the `https` protocol. Also note that the project will probably run on a different port when using SSL, so you must update that as well. To do so, log into the administrative user interface, navigate to `Applications`, then click the `Edit` button on your application and navigate to the `OAuth` tab. You can have more than one URL.

If you change the name of the application from 'your-application' to some other name, you will need to make sure the correct namespace is used in all of your code.

There are [multiple ways of deploying an application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/), but publishing ensures your deployment process is repeatable. You can use the [RID catalog](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog) to build different versions of this application for different platforms.

If you have trouble running the application, please verify all the files are updated as instructed. The directory for the `your-application` tree should look like this:
