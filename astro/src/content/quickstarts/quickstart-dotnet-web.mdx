import RemoteCode from '../../components/RemoteCode.astro';

In this quickstart you are going to build an application with C# and .Net and integrate it with FusionAuth.
You'll be building it for [ChangeBank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkH-kD73QUM), a global leader in converting dollars into coins.
It'll have areas reserved for users who have logged in as well as public facing sections.

The docker compose file and source code for a complete application are available on github under [fusionauth-quickstart-dotnet-web](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-dotnet-web) project.

## Prerequisites

- [.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download): This is the framework needed to run .Net applications.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com): The quickest way to stand up FusionAuth. (There are [other ways](/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/)).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download): The editor for making changes to code.  (You can use other editors as well.)

This app has been tested with .Net 7.0.7. This example should work with future compatible versions of .Net.

## General Architecture

While this sample application doesn't have login functionality without FusionAuth, a more typical integration will replace an existing login system with FusionAuth.

In that case, the system might look like this before FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginBefore alt={"Request flow during login before FusionAuth"}/>

The login flow will look like this after FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginAfter alt={"Request flow during login after FusionAuth"}/>

In general, you are introducing FusionAuth in order to normalize and consolidate user data. This helps make sure it is consistent and up-to-date as well as offloading your login security and functionality to FusionAuth.

## Getting Started

In this section, you'll get FusionAuth up and running and use .Net to create a new application.

### Clone the Code

First off, grab the code from the repository and change into that directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-dotnet-web.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-dotnet-web
```

### Run FusionAuth via Docker

In the root directory of the repo you'll find a Docker compose file (docker-compose.yml) and an environment variables configuration file (.env). Assuming you have Docker installed on your machine, you can stand up FusionAuth up on your machine with:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Here you are using a bootstrapping feature of FusionAuth, called [Kickstart](docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/kickstart). When FusionAuth comes up for the first time, it will look at the `kickstart/kickstart.json` file and configure FusionAuth to a certain initial state.

<Aside type="note">
If you ever want to reset the FusionAuth system, delete the volumes created by docker-compose by executing `docker-compose down -v`, then re-run `docker-compose up -d`.
</Aside>

FusionAuth will be initially configured with these settings:

* Your client Id is `e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e`.
* Your client secret is `super-secret-secret-that-should-be-regenerated-for-production`.
* Your example username is `user@fusionauthexample.com` and the password is `userpassword`.
* Your admin username is `admin@fusionauthexample.com` and the password is `adminpassword`.
* The base URL of FusionAuth `http://localhost:9011/`.

You can log into the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin) and look around if you want, but with Docker/Kickstart you don't need to.

### Create your .Net 7 Application

Now you are going to create a .Net application using C#. While this section builds a simple .Net web application, you can use the same configuration to integrate your existing .net application with FusionAuth.

You'll use [Razor Pages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio) and .Net 7. This application will display common information to all users. There will also be a secured area, only available to an authenticated user. The [full source code](https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-example-dotnet-guide) is available if you want to download it and take a look.

<Aside type="note">
If you simply want to run the application , there is a completed version in the 'complete-application' directory.  You can use the following commands to get it up and running if you do not want to create your own.

```shell
cd complete-application
dotnet publish -r osx-x64
dotnet run
```

Then view the website at the following location `http://localhost:5000`.
</Aside>

Since the complete application already exists in the `complete-application` directory, you will need to delete all files in the `compete-application` directory or choose a directory other than `fusionauth-quickstart-dotenet-web` to build the new application. 

Next open your command-line shell (i.e. Terminal on a Mac or Powershell on Windows) and navigate to the directory of your choice.  Then create a new web application using the `dotnet` CLI and go to that directory:

```shell
dotnet new webapp -o complete-application
cd complete-application
```

<Aside type="note">
If you change the name of the application from 'complete-application' to some other name, you will need to make sure the correct namespace is used in all of your code.
</Aside>

Creating a new application in Visual Studio will work as well.  You will use the command line here for the simplicity of the example.

To see the results, you should publish this application and run it. There are [multiple ways of deploying an application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/), but publishing ensures your deployment process is repeatable. You can use the [RID catalog](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog) to build different versions of this application for different platforms. Here's the command to publish a standalone executable you could deploy behind a proxy like Nginx:

```shell
dotnet publish -r osx-x64
```

Then start up the web application.

```shell
dotnet run
```
![Shell Showing Hosting Port](/img/articles/quickstart-dotnet-web/shell-window-showing-host-port.png)

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:{PortNumber}` where the port number will be displayed in your shell window.  I.E. `http://localhost:5178`

## Authentication

It's always smart to leverage existing libraries as they are likely to be more secure and better handle edge cases. You're going to add an `OpenIdConnect` library to the application. Make sure you're in the `complete-application` directory and run the command below to add the library.

```shell
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect
```

This application will contain two pages that require authorization.  The `Account` page will display the user's balance and the `MakeChange` page will make change for the user.  To protect these pages you can use the [Authorize filter attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/filter?view=aspnetcore-3.1#authorize-filter-attribute) in the [page model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio).

Create `Account.cshtml` and `Account.cshtml.cs` in the `Pages` directory. To protect the "Account" page you can use the [Authorize filter attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/filter?view=aspnetcore-3.1#authorize-filter-attribute) in the [page model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio).

Copy the following code into `Account.cshtml.cs`:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/Pages/Account.cshtml.cs"}
  lang="c#" />

Copy the following code into `Account.cshtml`:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/Pages/Account.cshtml"}
  lang="razor" />

Create `MakeChange.cshtml` and `MakeChange.cshtml.cs` in the `Pages` directory. You will use the same [Authorize filter attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/filter?view=aspnetcore-3.1#authorize-filter-attribute) to secure the page.

Copy the following code into `MakeChange.cshtml.cs`:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/Pages/MakeChange.cshtml.cs"}
  lang="c#" />

Copy the following code into `MakeChange.cshtml`:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/Pages/MakeChange.cshtml"}
  lang="razor" />

You will need a way to allow the user to logout of the application as well. You'll build the logout functionality in the `Logout` page. This will:

- Remove the session cookie.
- Redirect to the FusionAuth OAuth logout endpoint.

FusionAuth will then destroy its session and redirect the user back to the app's configured logout URL.

Add the following file to the `Pages` directory and call it `Logout.cshtml.cs`:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/Pages/Logout.cshtml.cs"}
  lang="c#" />

`OnGet` is the important method. Here you sign out using a method of the authentication library, delete the JWT cookie, and send the user to the FusionAuth OAuth logout endpoint.

Now add `Logout.cshtml` to the `Pages` directory. No content is necessary. Just declare the page and model as shown below.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/Pages/Logout.cshtml"}
  lang="razor" />

### Application Configuration
You will need to do a little plumbing to ensure things like having the correct settings and configuring the cookies properly to work over http for the sample application.

#### App Settings
Update the `appsettings.json` file. You need to add the entire `complete-application` object so that the code above can be configured correctly. `Authority` is just the location of the user identity server, in this case, FusionAuth.  `Urls` ensures the application runs on the specified port, 5000.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/appsettings.json"}
  lang="json" />

#### Program Settings
Update the `Program.cs` file. Since you are using unsecured cookies, you need to allow this in the configuration.  Safari and Chrome require different settings and that is reflected in the code below.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/Program.cs"}
  lang="c#" />

#### Startup Settings
Add the `Startup.cs` file in the root directory of the application. This sets the correct port and manages unsecured cookies for the browsers.  The `CheckSameSite` and `DisallowsSameSiteNone` functions help manage the cookie settings for the different browsers.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/Startup.cs"}
  lang="c#" />

<Aside type="note">
There are a few settings applied to simplify the sample application. In a production application, do not allow cookies over `http` or keep the `ClientSecret` in a .json file for production applications.  Get the `ClientSecret` from an environmental variable that has been set on a production machine or some other secure way.
</Aside>

#### Navigation
This application will display different menu items for authenticated users and non authenticated users. To add this type of navigation update `/Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` with the following:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml"}
  lang="razor" />

#### Homepage
Update the default page.

Copy the following code into `Index.cshtml.cs`:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/Pages/Index.cshtml.cs"}
  lang="c#" />

Copy the following code into `Index.cshtml` and notice the logic to show a different view to users that have not logged in.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/Pages/Index.cshtml"}
  lang="razor" />

#### Styling
To give the pages the look and feel of an application, apply the following styling and images.

Add the `changebank.css` file in the `wwwroot\css" directory of the application.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/wwwroot/css/changebank.css"}
  lang="css" />

Add the Changebank logo to the application.

Copy the money image for the `Index` page.

```shell
curl --create-dirs --output wwwroot/img/money.jpg  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-ruby-on-rails-web/main/complete-app/app/assets/images/money.jpg
```

## Conclusion

Your directory for the `complete-application` tree should look like this:

```text
└── complete-application
    ├── appsettings.Development.json
    ├── appsettings.json
    ├── bin/
        ├── ...
    ├── obj/
        ├── ...
    ├── Pages/
    │   ├── _ViewImports.cshtml
    │   ├── _ViewStart.cshtml
    |   |── Account.cshtml
    |   |── Accuont.cshtml.cs
    │   ├── Error.cshtml
    │   ├── Error.cshtml.cs
    │   ├── Index.cshtml
    │   ├── Index.cshtml.cs

    ├── Properties/
        ├── ...
    ├── Startup.cs
    └── wwwroot/
        ├── ...
```

Once you've created this directory structure, you can start up the {frontmatter.technology} application using this command:

```shell
cd complete-application
dotnet publish -r osx-x64
dotnet run
```

The full code is available [here](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-dotnet-web).

## Troubleshooting

If you run into an issue with cookies on Safari or other browsers, you might need to run the ASP.NET application under SSL.

You can follow [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/additional-tools/self-signed-certificates-guide) to install development SSL certificates for your .NET environment.

Alternatively, you can run the project using [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com), which will run the project using SSL.

If you do this, make sure to update the `Authorized Redirect URL` to reflect the `https` protocol. Also note that the project will probably run on a different port when using SSL, so you must update that as well. To do so, log into the administrative user interface, navigate to `Applications`, then click the `Edit` button on your application and navigate to the `OAuth` tab. You can have more than one URL.

## Next Steps
This quickstart is a great way to get a proof of concept up and running quickly, but to run
your application in production, there are some things you're going to want to do.

### FusionAuth Customization
FusionAuth gives you the ability to customize just about everything with the user's experience and your application's integration. This includes
* [Hosted pages](/docs/v1/tech/themes/) such as login, registration, email verification, and many more
* [Email templates](/docs/v1/tech/email-templates/email-templates)
* [User data and custom claims in access token JWTs](/articles/tokens/jwt-components-explained)

### Security
* [OmniAuth OpenIDConnect](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth) handles token validation and refresh
* You may want to customize the [token expiration times and policies](/docs/v1/tech/oauth/#configure-application-oauth-settings) in FusionAuth
* Choose [password rules](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/tenants#password) and a [hashing algorithm](/docs/v1/tech/reference/password-hashes) that meet your security needs

### Tenant and Application Management
* Model your application topology using [Applications](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/applications), [Roles](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/roles), [Groups](docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/groups), [Entities](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/groups), and more
* Set up [MFA](docs/v1/tech/guides/multi-factor-authentication), [Social login](/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers/), and/or [SAML](/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers/samlv2/) integrations
* Integrate with external systems using [Webhooks](/docs/v1/tech/events-webhooks/), [SCIM](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/scim), and [Lambdas](docs/v1/tech/lambdas/)
