In this quickstart you are going to build an application with Angular and integrate it with FusionAuth.
You'll be building it for [ChangeBank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXDxNCzUspM), a global leader in converting dollars into coins.
It'll have areas reserved for users who have logged in as well as public facing sections.

The docker compose file and source code for a complete application are available at
[https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-angular-web](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-angular-web).

## Prerequisites
* [Node v18](https://nodejs.org/en): This will be used to run the Angular application.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com): The quickest way to stand up FusionAuth. (There are [other ways](/docs/get-started/download-and-install)).

This app has been tested with Node v18 and Angular v16.2.0. This example should work with other compatible versions of Node and Angular.

## General Architecture

While this sample application doesn't have login functionality without FusionAuth, a more typical integration will replace an existing login system with FusionAuth.

In that case, the system might look like this before FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginBefore alt={"Request flow during login before FusionAuth"}/>

The login flow will look like this after FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginAfterSdk alt={"Request flow during login after FusionAuth"}/>

In general, you are introducing FusionAuth in order to normalize and consolidate user data. This helps to make sure it is consistent and up-to-date as well as offloading your login security and functionality to FusionAuth.

## Getting Started

In this section, you'll get FusionAuth up and running and use Angular CLI to create a new application.

### Clone the Code
First off, grab the code from the repository and change into that directory.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-angular-web.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-angular-web
```

### Run FusionAuth via Docker
In the root directory of the repo you'll find a Docker compose file (docker-compose.yml) and an environment
variables configuration file (.env). Assuming you have Docker installed on your machine, you can stand up
FusionAuth up on your machine with:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

This will start three containers, once each for FusionAuth, Postgres, and Elastic.

Here you are using a bootstrapping feature of FusionAuth, called [Kickstart](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/kickstart).
When FusionAuth comes up for the first time, it will look at the `kickstart/kickstart.json` file and
configure FusionAuth to a certain initial state.

<Aside type="note">
    If you ever want to reset the FusionAuth system, delete the volumes created by docker-compose by
    executing `docker compose down -v`, then re-run `docker compose up -d`.
</Aside>

<p id="fusionauthconfig">FusionAuth will be configured with these settings</p>
* Your Client Id is `e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e`.
* Your Client Secret is `super-secret-secret-that-should-be-regenerated-for-production`.
* Your example username is `richard@example.com` and the password is `password`.
* Your admin username is `admin@example.com` and the password is `password`.
* The base URL of FusionAuth `http://localhost:9011/`.

You can log into the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin) and look around if you want, but with Docker/Kickstart you don’t need to.

### Create a basic Angular application

Now you are going to create a basic Angular application using the Angular CLI. While this section builds a simple Angular application, you can use the same configuration to integrate your existing Angular application with FusionAuth.

```shell
npx @angular/cli new changebank && cd changebank
```

You'll be prompted to answer a few questions about your application. You can choose the defaults for all of them.

#### Create the Application

We are going to use the [Hosted Backend](/docs/apis/hosted-backend) feature of FusionAuth, so you don't need to worry about setting up a backend server.

First, install the FusionAuth Angular SDK:

```shell
npm install @fusionauth/angular-sdk
```

Next, you'll need to configure the SDK with your FusionAuth URL and Client Id. You can do this by adding the following to your `src/app/app.module.ts` file inside the `imports: [ ]` section:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-angular-web/main/complete-application/src/app/app.module.ts"
            lang="typescript"
            tags="fusionAuthModuleConfiguration"/>

Don't forget to import the `FusionAuthModule` at the top of the file.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-angular-web/main/complete-application/src/app/app.module.ts"
            lang="typescript"
            tags="importAngularSDK"/>


Our example application is going to have a home page, an account page and a page where someone can make change. The account and make change page will be protected and only visible to logged in users.

#### Create a Home Page

The next step is to get a basic home page up and running. We’ll take this opportunity to copy in all the images and CSS style files that you’ll need for the application.

Run the following copy commands to copy these files from the quickstart repo into your project. This assumes that you checked the quickstart repo out into the parent directory. If that’s not the case, replace the `..` below with your actual repo location.

```shell
cp -r ../complete-application/src/assets src && \
cp -r ../complete-application/src/styles.css src
```

The home page will be a simple page with a welcome message and a login link. You can create a new component for this page with the Angular CLI:

```shell
npx ng generate component home-page --standalone
```

Then, add the welcome message and login link to the `src/app/home-page/home-page.component.html` template by replacing the contents of that file with the below contents:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-angular-web/main/complete-application/src/app/home-page/home-page.component.html"
            lang="html"/>

And the login function to the component `src/app/home-page/home-page.component.ts`. Update that file to look like this:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-angular-web/main/complete-application/src/app/home-page/home-page.component.ts"
            lang="typescript"/>

#### Create an Account Page

The account page displays a random balance for the logged in user. You can create a new component for this page with the Angular CLI:

```shell
npx ng generate component account-page --standalone
```

Then, display the balance in the `src/app/account-page/account-page.component.html` template by replacing the default content with the below:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-angular-web/main/complete-application/src/app/account-page/account-page.component.html"
            lang="html"/>

You'll need the balance property in the component `src/app/account-page/account-page.component.ts`. Update that file to look like this content:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-angular-web/main/complete-application/src/app/account-page/account-page.component.ts"
            lang="typescript"/>

#### Create A Make Change Page

Next, you'll create a page only visible to logged in users. This page displays an input field for the user to enter a dollar amount and a button to convert that amount into coins. You can create a new component for this page with the Angular CLI:

```shell
npx ng generate component make-change-page --standalone
```

Then, add the input field and button to the `src/app/make-change-page/make-change-page.component.html` template, replacing the current contents:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-angular-web/main/complete-application/src/app/make-change-page/make-change-page.component.html"
            lang="html"/>

You'll also need the make change function to the component `src/app/make-change-page/make-change-page.component.ts`. Here is the full contents of that file:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-angular-web/main/complete-application/src/app/make-change-page/make-change-page.component.ts"
            lang="typescript"/>

## Authentication

You now have created a basic Angular application with a home page, account page and a page for making change. The next step is to add authentication to the application.

### Auth Guard

The first step is to create an Auth Guard. This will be used to protect the account page and only allow logged in users to access it.

Create a new file called `auth-guard.ts` in the `src/app` directory:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-angular-web/main/complete-application/src/app/auth-guard.ts"
            lang="typescript"/>

The Auth Guard is a functional router guard, which can be used to handle anonymous and logged in states. The first parameter defines if
the guard should allow logged in users `true` or anonymous users `false`. The second parameter is the route to redirect to if the guard fails.

### Routing

Next, you'll need to add the Auth Guard to the routing configuration. Open the `src/app/app.module.ts` file and add the RouterModule with the following routes inside the `imports: [ ]` part:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-angular-web/main/complete-application/src/app/app.module.ts"
            lang="typescript"
            tags="routerConfiguration"/>

Don't forget to import the `RouterModule` and `authGuard` at the top of the file.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-angular-web/main/complete-application/src/app/app.module.ts"
            lang="typescript"
            tags="importAuthGuard"/>


### Tie it all together

Now that you have the Auth Guard and the routing configured, you can tie it all together. Open the `src/app/app.component.html` file and replace its content with the following:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-angular-web/main/complete-application/src/app/app.component.html"
            lang="html"/>

Finally, open the `src/app/app.component.ts` file and replace it with the following:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-angular-web/main/complete-application/src/app/app.component.ts"
            lang="typescript"/>

## Running the Application

You can now run the application with the following command:

```shell
npm start
```

You can now open up an incognito window and navigate to http://localhost:4200. You will be greeted with the home page. Log in with the user account you created when setting up FusionAuth, and you'll be redirected to the account page.

## Next Steps
This quickstart is a great way to get a proof of concept up and running quickly, but to run your application in production, there are some things you're going to want to do.

### FusionAuth Customization
FusionAuth gives you the ability to customize just about everything with the user's experience and your application's integration. This includes
* [Hosted pages](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/) such as login, registration, email verification, and many more
* [Email templates](/docs/customize/email-and-messages/email-templates)
* [User data and custom claims in access token JWTs](/articles/tokens/jwt-components-explained)

### Security
* You may want to customize the [token expiration times and policies](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/#configure-application-oauth-settings) in FusionAuth
* Choose [password rules](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/tenants#password) and a [hashing algorithm](/docs/reference/password-hashes) that meet your security needs

### Tenant and Application Management
* Model your application topology using [Applications](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/applications), [Roles](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/roles), [Groups](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/groups), [Entities](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/groups), and more
* Set up [MFA](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/multi-factor-authentication), [Social login](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/identity-providers/), and/or [SAML](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/identity-providers/overview-samlv2) integrations
* Integrate with external systems using [Webhooks](/docs/extend/events-and-webhooks/), [SCIM](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/scim/scim), and [Lambdas](/docs/extend/code/lambdas/)
