You've chosen to install FusionAuth via Fast Path, using a local database (PostgreSQL or MySQL). 

This is the best option if you have a local database already set up or you want to test FusionAuth with an external database.

If you've arrived here directly, start with the [5-Minute Setup Guide Overview](/docs/quickstarts/5-minute-setup-guide).

Below is a brief video showing how to set up FusionAuth in less than 5 minutes.

## Overview

Here are steps to take to set up FusionAuth and configure it to provide login and logout functionality for your application.

- [Install FusionAuth](#1-install-fusionauth)
- [Start FusionAuth](#2-start-fusionauth)
- [Complete Maintenance Mode](#3-complete-maintenance-mode)
- [Complete the Setup Wizard](#4-complete-the-setup-wizard)
- [Create an Application and configure the OAuth settings](#5-create-an-application-and-configure-the-oauth-settings)
- [Grant Permissions](#6-grant-permissions)
- [Configure the Backend to Complete the Login](#7-configure-the-backend-to-complete-the-login)
- [Store the user object in the session](#8-store-the-user-object-in-the-session)
- [Test the Application](#9-test-the-application)
- [Logout](#10-logout)
- [Summing Up](#11-summing-up)

Steps similar to these will be used for integrating with any identity provider. Let's get into the details of each step. 

## 1. Install FusionAuth

You are following the FastPath installation guide, so you'll use the FastPath method to install FusionAuth.

<FastPathInstall />

Once the Fast Path installer completes, you will see the below output.

```sh title="Fast Path Install Complete"
Downloading zip packages
######################################################################## 100.0%
######################################################################## 100.0%
Installing packages
Install is complete. Time for tacos.

 1. To start FusionAuth run the following command
    /Users/bpontarelli/dev/example/fusionauth/bin/startup.sh

 2. To begin, access FusionAuth by opening a browser to http://localhost:9011

 3. If you're looking for documentation, open your browser and navigate to https://fusionauth.io/docs

Thank you have a nice day.
```

Don't forget to enjoy the tacos.

## 2. Start FusionAuth

The next step is to start FusionAuth using the command that the Fast Path installer created. This script is called `startup.sh` or `startup.ps1`. You can execute it from the installation directory.

```shell title="MacOS and Linux Startup Script"
fusionauth/bin/startup.sh
```

If you are on Windows, you'll need to use the `startup.ps1`. Prior to version `1.40.0` the file will be named `startup.bat` instead.

```shell title="Windows Startup Script"
.\fusionauth\bin\startup.ps1
```

This script will start both the `fusionauth-app` component as well as the `fusionauth-search` component if you downloaded the Elasticsearch option. (Here's [a document on how to choose whether to do so](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/users#user-search).)

## 3. Return to the main guide

After you have FusionAuth installed and running, open your browser to `http://localhost:9011`. This is the default address for FusionAuth when running locally. This will bring up the FusionAuth admin UI, which should be sitting in Maintenance Mode and ready to be configured. 

You can now return to the main <a href="/docs/quickstarts#setup">guide</a> to add FusionAuth to a running application.
