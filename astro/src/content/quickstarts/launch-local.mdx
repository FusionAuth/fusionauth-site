You've chosen to install FusionAuth via Fast Path, using a local database (PostgreSQL or MySQL). 

This is the best option if you have a local database already set up or you want to test FusionAuth with an external database.

If you've arrived here directly, start with the [5-Minute Setup Guide Overview](/docs/quickstarts/5-minute-setup-guide).

Below is a brief video showing how to set up FusionAuth in less than 5 minutes.

## Requirements

### PostgreSQL

You need to have either a MySQL or PostgreSQL database installed. You also need a superuser name and password for the database; this user needs to be able to create schemas and databases.

If you do not have a database installed, follow the instructions in our [Database Installation Guide](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/database) to install a database. Below, you see commands to test if the PostgreSQL command line tool, `psql`, is present.

```shell script title="Testing the PostgreSQL Installation"
psql --version
```

```shell script title="Result Of Testing the PostgreSQL Installation"
psql (PostgreSQL) 12.3
```

## Overview

Here are steps to take to set up FusionAuth. When you've finished these steps you can move on to the next tutorial, configuring FusionAuth to control access to your application.

- [Install FusionAuth](#1-install-fusionauth)
- [Start FusionAuth](#2-start-fusionauth)

Let's get into the details of each step. 

## 1. Install FusionAuth

### Clone the repository with your needed files 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/synedra/fusionauth-first-steps-launch.git
cd fusionauth-first-steps-launch
```

### Set Environment Variables for your installation

Your postgres installation is expected to have a 'fusionauth' user with a password of 'fusionauth'.

If it does not, you will need to change the environment variables DATABASE_ROOT_USERNAME and DATABASE_ROOT_PASSWORD to a root user in the DB.

Set the following environment variables:

```
export DATABASE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/fusionauth
export DATABASE_ROOT_USERNAME=fusionauth
export DATABASE_ROOT_PASSWORD=fusionauth
export FUSIONAUTH_APP_KICKSTART_FILE=`pwd`/kickstart/kickstart.json
```

You are following the FastPath installation guide, so you'll use the FastPath method to install FusionAuth.

```
bash install.sh
```

Once the Fast Path installer completes, you will see the below output.

```sh title="Fast Path Install Complete"
Downloading zip packages
######################################################################## 100.0%
######################################################################## 100.0%
Installing packages
Install is complete. Time for tacos.

 1. To start FusionAuth run the following command
    /Users/bpontarelli/dev/example/fusionauth/bin/startup.sh

 2. To begin, access FusionAuth by opening a browser to http://localhost:9011

 3. If you're looking for documentation, open your browser and navigate to https://fusionauth.io/docs

Thank you have a nice day.
```

## 2. Start FusionAuth

The next step is to start FusionAuth using the command that the Fast Path installer created. This script is called `startup.sh` or `startup.ps1`. You can execute it from the installation directory.

```shell title="MacOS and Linux Startup Script"
./fusionauth/bin/startup.sh
```

If you are on Windows, you'll need to use the `startup.ps1`. Prior to version `1.40.0` the file will be named `startup.bat` instead.

```shell title="Windows Startup Script"
.\fusionauth\bin\startup.ps1
```

This script will start both the `fusionauth-app` component as well as the `fusionauth-search` component if you downloaded the Elasticsearch option. (Here's [a document on how to choose whether to do so](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/users#user-search).)

## 3. Return to the main guide

After you have FusionAuth installed and running, open your browser to `http://localhost:9011`. This is the default address for FusionAuth when running locally. This will bring up the FusionAuth admin UI, which should be sitting in Maintenance Mode and ready to be configured. 

You can now return to the main <a href="/docs/quickstarts#setup">guide</a> to add FusionAuth to a running application.

## Summing Up

To verify that your system is set up, navigate to http://localhost:9011 and be sure you can see the FusionAuth UI.  

You're done with step 1... congratulations!  You've got your own FusionAuth server running on your system.
Your system has been set up using a Kickstart to pre-populate the tutorial environment with an application and some users. 
Feel free to explore what's available before moving on to configuring your application's security using FusionAuth.

From here, you can return to the <a href="/docs/quickstarts#setup">guide</a> to continue on to the next step.
