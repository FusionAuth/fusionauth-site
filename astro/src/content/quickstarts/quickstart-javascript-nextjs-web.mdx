In this quickstart you are going to build an application with Express and integrate it with FusionAuth.
You'll be building it for [ChangeBank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkH-kD73QUM), a global leader in converting dollars into coins.
It'll have areas reserved for users who have logged in as well as public facing sections.

The docker compose file and source code for a complete application are available at
https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-express-web

## Prerequisites
* [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com): The quickest way to stand up FusionAuth. (There are [other ways](/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/)).
* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/): Not required but recommended if you want to track your changes.

## General architecture

While this sample application doesn't have login functionality without FusionAuth, a more typical integration will replace an existing login system with FusionAuth.

In that case, the system might look like this before FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginBefore alt={"Request flow during login before FusionAuth"}/>

The login flow will look like this after FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginAfter alt={"Request flow during login after FusionAuth"}/>

In general, you are introducing FusionAuth in order to normalize and consolidate user data. This helps make sure it is consistent and up-to-date as well as offloading your login security and functionality to FusionAuth.

## Getting Started
In this section, you'll get FusionAuth up and running, and configured with the ChangeBank application.

### Clone the Code
First off, grab the code from the repository and change into that directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-express-web.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-express-web
```

### Run FusionAuth via Docker

In the root directory of the repo you'll find a Docker compose file (docker-compose.yml) and an environment
variables configuration file (.env). Assuming you have Docker installed on your machine, you can stand up
FusionAuth up on your machine with:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start three containers, once each for FusionAuth, Postgres, and Elastic.

Here you are using a bootstrapping feature of FusionAuth, called [Kickstart](/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/kickstart).
When FusionAuth comes up for the first time, it will look at the `kickstart/kickstart.json` file and
configure FusionAuth to a certain initial state.

<Aside type="note">
If you ever want to reset the FusionAuth system, delete the volumes created by docker-compose by
executing `docker-compose down -v`, then re-run `docker-compose up -d`.
</Aside>

FusionAuth will be configured with these settings
* Your client Id is `c2aeeb1e-65cd-43c5-9326-02dce5e03705`.
* Your client secret is `2HYT86lWSAntc-mvtHLX5XXEpk9ThcqZb4YEh65CLjA-not-for-prod`.
* Your example username is `richard@example.com` and the password is `password`.
* Your admin username is `admin@example.com` and the password is `password`.
* The base URL of FusionAuth `http://localhost:9011/`.

You can log into the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin) and look around if you want, but with Docker/Kickstart you donâ€™t need to.

### Setup Application

In this section, you'll set up a basic Next.js application with two pages. 

1. Homepage
1. Account

#### Setup Your Environment

Create a new application using the `npx` command

```shell
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Accept all of the default prompts like below

TODO: ADD PIC

Make sure you are in your new directory `changebank`

Install [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/example), like any tutorial I will show you what this magic does later.
```shell
npm install next-auth
```
