## Prerequisites
* [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com): The quickest way to stand up FusionAuth. (There are [other ways](/docs/get-started/download-and-install)).
* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/): Not required but recommended if you want to track your changes.

## General Architecture

<LoginArchitectureWeb />

## Getting Started
In this section, you'll get FusionAuth up and running, and configured with the ChangeBank application.

### Clone The Code
First off, grab the code from the repository and change into that directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-nextjs-web.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-nextjs-web
```

### Run FusionAuth Via Docker

<DockerSpinup kickstartUri={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} />

### Create Next.js Application

In this section, you'll set up a basic Next.js application with two pages. 

1. Homepage
1. Account - protected

Create a new application using the `npx`.

```shell
npx create-next-app@latest changebank --ts --eslint --no-tailwind --src-dir --app --import-alias "@/*"
```

Make sure you are in your new directory `changebank`.

```shell
cd changebank
```

Install [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/example), which simplifies integrating with FusionAuth and creating a secure web application.

```shell
npm install next-auth
```

Copy environment variables from our complete application example.

```shell
cp ../complete-application/.env.example .env.local
```

Also copy an image file into a new directory within `public` called `img`.

```shell
mkdir ./public/img && cp ../complete-application/public/img/money.jpg ./public/img/money.jpg
```

As you will be recreating all of the files in our app directory, please delete all files within `/src/app`.

```shell
rm -rf ./src/app && mkdir ./src/app
```

## Authentication

Next.js 13.2 introduced <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/router-handlers" target="_blank">Route Handlers</a>, which are the preferred way to handle REST-like requests. In the `Changebank` application you can configure NextAuth.js FusionAuth's provider in a new route handler by creating a file within `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`.

On first load of Next.js this file will make sure that you have all of the correct environment variables. The variables are then exported in an object called `authOptions` which can be imported on the server when you need to get our session using `getServerSession`.

The `FusionAuthProvider` is then provided to `NextAuth` as a provider for any `GET` or `POST` commands that are sent to the `/api/auth/*` route.

Create a new file named `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` and copy the following code for the ChangeBank application.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts"}
  lang="ts" />

## App Customization

### Styles

Create a new file named `src/app/globals.css` and copy the below CSS for the ChangeBank application.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/src/app/globals.css"}
  lang="ts" />

### Login Button

Create a new file in `src/components/LoginButton.tsx` that will be used for a button component. Our login button will only be used on the client side so make sure to add `use client` at the top of this file.
For this button you can use the `signIn` and `signOut` functions from `next-auth/react`. By passing in the session from our pages you can determine if the `Log in` or `Log out` should be shown.

Copy the below code for the ChangeBank application into `src/components/LoginButton.tsx`.
<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/src/components/LoginButton.tsx"}
  lang="ts" />

### Login Link

Create a new file in `src/components/LoginLink.tsx` that will be used for a link component. Our login link will only be used on the client side so make sure to add `use client` at the top of this file.
For this link you can use the `signIn` function from `next-auth/react`.

Copy the below code for the ChangeBank application into `src/components/LoginLink.tsx`.
<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/src/components/LoginLink.tsx"}
  lang="ts" />

### Layout

<Aside type="tip">
If this is your first time using the Next.js App Router, you should read through <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing" target="_blank">Routing Fundamentals</a>.
</Aside>

Below you will find the full code for the [Root Layout](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#root-layout-required).

This has the overall structure of our application. The other pages will be added where `{children}` is located.

Create a new file named `src/app/layout.tsx` and copy the below code to create the layout for the ChangeBank application.
<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/src/app/layout.tsx"}
  lang="ts" />

### Home Page

Create a new file `src/app/page.tsx` which will have the Homepage details. Not much here just an image and another Login button.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/src/app/page.tsx"}
  lang="ts" />


### Account Page

Create a new file `src/app/account/page.tsx` which will have the Account details.

One special note here is that there is a check to see if the session is missing. If it is, you redirect back to the homepage which protects this page on the server for unauthorized access. (You can find the same when a user is logged in on the homepage, it will redirect to `/account`)

Here's the contents of `src/app/account/page.tsx`.
<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/src/app/account/page.tsx"}
  lang="ts" />

### Make Change Page

Finally, we'll add some business logic for logged in users to make change with the following code in `src/app/makechange/page.tsx`:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/src/app/makechange/page.tsx"}
  lang="ts" />

If the user session is not present the user is redirect back the homepage at the base route. If the user is present then the `MakeChangeForm` is presented. Create a new file located at `/src/components/MakeChangeForm.tsx` with the below code. This component has all of the business logic needed for taking in a dollar amount of money and returning the correct amount of each coin.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/src/components/MakeChangeForm.tsx"}
  lang="ts" />

### Run the Application
You can now open up an incognito window and visit the NextJS app at http://localhost:3000/. Log in with the user account you created when setting up FusionAuth, and you’ll see the email of the user next to a logout button.

```shell
npm run dev
```

Try clicking the <InlineUIElement>Login</InlineUIElement> button at the top or center of the screen.

This will take you through the `NextAuth.js` authentication flow. First prompting you to select `Sign in with FusionAuth`. 

You can then login to FusionAuth with Email: `richard@example.com` Password: `password` (as you might expect not ideal for production.)

This will then take you back to the application in the API route it will check for a session and appropriately redirect you to the `/account` route when your session has been established.
