## Overview

Add login, registration, multifactor authentication (MFA), single sign-on (SSO), and much more to your apps in days, not months, using FusionAuth.

In this quickstart you:
- Create a basic app.
- Add a public page and a protected account page.
- Add registration, login, and logout.
- Add a call to show user data on the protected page.

## Before you start

To use this quickstart you need:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) version xx or later to run the container with FusionAuth.
- [Node.js 22](https://nodejs.org/en) or later to run the React app.
- A project directory to work in.

The <a href={frontmatter.codeRepository}>repository for this quickstart</a> includes the code for the different stages in four directories:

- `01_start`: Empty files.
- `02_noAuthentication`: The example app with placeholder pages and no authentication.
- `03_withAuthentication`: Adds authentication that uses FusionAuth.
- `04_callTheServer`: Adds updating the authentication cookie to the account page.

You can start from any of these points, or jump ahead to one of them if you get stuck.

## Create a React application without authentication

The initial React app has three components:

- `index.tsx`: The app container, which also provides routing from one page to another.
- `home.tsx`: The login page.
- `account.tsx`: The account page, which shows the user’s details.

**Task 1:** In your project directory, create `index.html` with the following content:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-react/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/02_noAuthentication/index.html" lang="tsx"/>

At `1`, this file loads the React app from the `src="/index.tsx"` landing component.

**Task 2:** Create `index.tsx` with the following content:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-react/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/02_noAuthentication/index.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

This landing component creates an `App` component that routes `/account` to the account component, and routes `/` and all other URLs to the home component. The code then uses React to insert the app into the page as the `root` element.

**Task 3:** Create the homepage, `home.tsx`, with the following content:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-react/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/02_noAuthentication/home.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

**Task 4:** Create the account page, `account.tsx`, with the following content:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-react/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/02_noAuthentication/account.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

The homepage and account page are placeholders for future content, with buttons that redirect the user from one page to the other with no authentication.

**Task 5:** Create the stylesheet, `index.css`, with the following content:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-react/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/02_noAuthentication/index.css" lang="css"/>

Now the app is ready to run.

**Task 6:** Open a terminal in the project directory and run the commands below to install the Node.js packages for React and then start the web server.

```sh
npm install  @fusionauth/react-sdk@~2.5.1  react@~19.1.1  react-dom@~19.1.1  react-router-dom@6.7.0

npm install --save-dev  @eslint/js@~9.33.0  @types/react@~19.1.10  eslint@~9.33.0  typescript@~5.9.2  typescript-eslint@~8.40.0  parcel@~2.15.4

npx parcel index.html --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
```

**Task 7:** Open a browser and view http://localhost:3000 to see the site.

![Login page with no authentication](../../../public/img/quickstarts/quickstart-javascript-react-web/login.webp)

You’re able to use the login button to open the account page because there’s no authentication or protected URLs.

## Download and run FusionAuth

Next, set up FusionAuth as the authentication provider by installing and running a preconfigured version of FusionAuth in a Docker container.

**Task 1:** Download and run a Docker container with FusionAuth:

<DownloadWidget kickstartEnabled={true} kickstartName={"quickstart-spa"} />

**Task 2:** Open http://localhost:9011/admin to check you can log in to the FusionAuth web interface. Use the following credentials:

- Username: `admin@example.com`
- Password: `password`

<Aside type="note">
In this example, FusionAuth has already been configured to communicate with an app on http://localhost:3000, where the example React app is running. [Kickstart](https://fusionauth.io/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/kickstart) does this configuration. It allows you to build a FusionAuth instance template of API requests that executes during startup to quickly replicate development or production environments.

Your React app needs only a static web server because FusionAuth provides a [hosted backend](https://fusionauth.io/docs/apis/hosted-backend) for purely frontend apps.
</Aside>

## Add authentication to the app with FusionAuth

Now that FusionAuth is running, you must update the `.tsx` files to use FusionAuth authentication.

**Task 1:** Overwrite `index.tsx` with the content below.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-react/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/03_withAuthentication/index.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

The new `FusionAuthProviderConfig` section at the top of the file tells the `@fusionauth/react-sdk` where it can talk to FusionAuth. Because you created a client-side app, not a server-side app, you don't need to hide any secrets in this section.

At the bottom of the code, `<FusionAuthProvider {...config}>` wraps the app and adds authentication features to all the components. To use those features, you must add a few lines to redirect the user to FusionAuth for login and to check whether they are logged in.

**Task 2:** Overwrite `home.tsx` with the content below.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-react/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/03_withAuthentication/home.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

The `useFusionAuth()` line adds helper functions to the homepage code. The user is redirected to the account page if `isLoggedIn` is true. The `startLogin()` line adds authentication to the login button.

That's all you need to do to provide authentication with FusionAuth.

**Task 3:** Overwrite `account.tsx` with the content below.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-react/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/03_withAuthentication/account.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

Similar to the homepage, `useFusionAuth()` adds the helper functions, and `startLogout()` adds authentication to the logout button. The `userinfo` object provides the user details for the account page.

The `getExpiryTimeInSeconds()` function checks the `app.at_ex` to see when the authentication cookie expires. The `useEffect(() => {` section that uses the expiry time function updates the label on the screen every second.

**Task 4:** Reopen the app at http://localhost:3000 and ensure you've logged out of the admin@example.com account. Click the login button and log in with the new credentials (which were created automatically by the Kickstart script):

- Username: `richard@example.com`
- Password: `password`

Note how the port number changes in the URL when the app redirects you to log in via the FusionAuth service and then returns you to the app (on port 3000).

![Log in with FusionAuth](../../../public/img/quickstarts/quickstart-javascript-react-web/fa.webp)

![Account page](../../../public/img/quickstarts/quickstart-javascript-react-web/account.webp)

When you change the URL in the address bar to browse to the homepage or account page, you're redirected based on whether you're logged in or not. Authentication protects your private pages.

## Call FusionAuth only when authenticated

Once a user has successfully logged in, FusionAuth stores an `http-only` cookie in their browser. If you use a full web server instead of this example's static file host in the future, you can check for the presence of this cookie to verify that the user is authenticated. For calls to the FusionAuth API, you need an API key, and thus for security's sake you need to make the calls from a server instead of the browser. Since this example doesn't use a server, almost no calls to the FusionAuth API can be made.

As an illustration of calling FusionAuth from the browser only when you're logged in, in this section you add a call to [refresh the user's authentication cookie](https://fusionauth.io/docs/apis/hosted-backend#refresh). (Note that this call isn't necessary because you set `shouldAutoRefresh: true` in the `FusionAuthProviderConfig` in `index.tsx`, which refreshes the user's cookie when it expires anyway.)

**Task 1:** Insert the code below into `account.tsx` at the bottom of the file just before the closing `</div>` tag for the element `<div className="userInfoGrid">` and save.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-react/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/04_callTheServer/account.tsx" lang="tsx" tags="fusionauth"/>

**Task 2:** Browse to the account page and click the refresh button. Notice your authentication expiration resets.
