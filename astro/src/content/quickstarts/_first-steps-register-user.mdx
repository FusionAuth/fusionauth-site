Adding a registration to a user is not always required to let your users log in to your application.

FusionAuth supports self-service registration. With self-service registration enabled, a registration will be added when a user signs up. Learn more about [self-service registration](/docs/lifecycle/register-users/basic-registration-forms).

Log out from the administration site by clicking the "Logout" button at the top right of the screen.
