## Prerequisites
* [Node v18](https://nodejs.org/en): This will be used to run the React application.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com): The quickest way to stand up FusionAuth. (There are [other ways](/docs/get-started/download-and-install)).

This app has been tested with Node v18 and React v18.2.0. This example should work with other compatible versions of Node and React.

## General Architecture

<LoginArchitectureSdk />

## Getting Started

In this section, you'll get FusionAuth up and running and use React CLI to create a new application.

### Clone the Code
First off, grab the code from the repository and change into that directory.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web
```

### Run FusionAuth via Docker

<DockerSpinup kickstartUri={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} />

### Create a basic React application

Now you are going to create a basic React application using the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). While this section builds a simple React application, you can use the same configuration to integrate your existing React application with FusionAuth.

```shell
npm create vite@latest changebank -- --template react-ts && cd changebank
```
<Aside type="note">
    The FusionAuth server is configured with the valid redirect URI of localhost:3000. Ensure your changebank app runs on this port by adding `server: { port: 3000 }` to your `vite.config.ts`.
</Aside>

We are going to use the [Hosted Backend](/docs/apis/hosted-backend) feature of FusionAuth, so you don't need to worry about setting up a backend server.

<Aside type="caution">
While this example uses localhost for your application and FusionAuth, there are complications if you plan to deploy using FusionAuth Cloud.

  <HostedBackendWarning />

Install the FusionAuth React SDK, and React Router, which we'll use to manage the routes in our application:

```shell
npm install @fusionauth/react-sdk react-router-dom
```

Next, you'll need to configure the SDK with your FusionAuth URL, client Id, and redirect URI. You can do this by updating `src/main.tsx`:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/main/complete-application/src/main.tsx"
            lang="tsx"/>

We also set up the `BrowserRouter` from React Router, which will allow us to use the `Routes` and `Route` component to define the routes later.

Our example application is going to have a home page and an account page. The account page will be protected and only visible to logged in users.

#### Create a Home Page

The next step is to get a basic home page up and running. We’ll take this opportunity to copy in all the images and CSS style files that you’ll need for the application.

Run the following copy commands to copy these files from the quickstart repo into your project. This assumes that you checked the quickstart repo out into the parent directory. If that’s not the case, replace the `..` below with your actual repo location.

```shell
cp -r ../complete-application/src/assets src && \
cp -r ../complete-application/src/index.css src
```

The home page will be a simple page with a welcome message and a login link. Create a new directory `pages` under `src`, in that directory create a new file `src/pages/HomePage.tsx`:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/main/complete-application/src/pages/HomePage.tsx"
            lang="tsx"/>

#### Create an Account Page

The account page will be a simple page that displays a random balance for the logged in user. Create a new file `src/pages/AccountPage.tsx`:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/main/complete-application/src/pages/AccountPage.tsx"
            lang="tsx"/>

#### Create A Make Change Page

The make change page will be a simple page that displays an input field for the user to enter a dollar amount and a button to convert that amount into coins. Create a new file `src/pages/MakeChangePage.tsx`:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/main/complete-application/src/pages/MakeChangePage.tsx"
            lang="tsx"/>

## Authentication

You now have created a basic React application with a home page and an account page.

Depending on the user's authentication state, the login or logout button should be displayed in the header. For this create a new directory `components` in `src` and a new file `src/components/LogoHeader.tsx`:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/main/complete-application/src/components/LogoHeader.tsx"
            lang="tsx"/>

Additionally, we want to display different menu items. For this create a new file `src/components/MenuBar.tsx`:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/main/complete-application/src/components/MenuBar.tsx"
            lang="tsx"/>

The next step is to tie it all together. Update the `src/App.tsx` file by replacing its content with the following code:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/main/complete-application/src/App.tsx"
            lang="tsx"/>

## Running the Application

You can now run the application with the following command:

```shell
npm start
```

You can now open up an incognito window and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You will be greeted with the home page. Log in with the user account you created when setting up FusionAuth, and you'll be redirected to the account page.

<Aside type="note">
    The username and password of the `example user` can be found in the <a href="#run-fusionauth-via-docker">FusionAuth via Docker</a> section at the top of this article.

    <li>You can use the hosted backend pages to run this example without your own OAuth backend, but [review the hosted backend docs](/docs/apis/hosted-backend) to be aware of the limitations of this approach.</li>
