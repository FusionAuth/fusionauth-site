## Overview

With FusionAuth, you can easily add login, registration, single sign-on (SSO), and multifactor authentication (MFA) to an application.

In only 15 minutes and 15 steps, this quickstart guide demonstrates how to create a simple React app, install and run a local instance of FusionAuth, and use it to add login authentication and user details to the React app.

## Before you begin

- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com). You need no further software to run FusionAuth and the React app, but you can use [Node.js 22](https://nodejs.org/en) to run the React app if you prefer.
- Create a project directory, such as `fusionauth-example-react-app`, anywhere you want to store your app.

<Aside type="note">
You can view the final app created in this tutorial by downloading [the accompanying repository](https://github.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart), which has two directories:

- `1_noAuthentication` contains the example app with placeholder pages and no authentication.
- `2_withAuthentication` contains the app with placeholder pages and authentication provided by FusionAuth.
</Aside>

## Create a React app without authentication

The initial React app has no authentication and consists of three components:

- `index.tsx`: The app container, which also provides routing from one page to another
- `home.tsx`: The login page
- `account.tsx`: The account page, which shows the user's details

**Step 1:** In your project directory, create `index.html` with the content below.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/1_noAuthentication/index.html" lang="tsx"/>

This file loads the React app from the `src="/index.tsx"` landing component.

**Step 2:** Create `index.tsx` with the content below.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/1_noAuthentication/index.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

This landing component creates an `App` component that routes `/account` to the account component, and routes `/` and all other URLs to the home component. The code then uses React to insert the app into the page as the `root` element.

**Step 3:** Create the homepage, `home.tsx`, with the content below.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/1_noAuthentication/home.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

**Step 4:** Create the account page, `account.tsx`, with the content below.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/1_noAuthentication/account.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

The homepage and account page are placeholders for future content, with buttons that redirect the user from one page to the other with no authentication.

**Step 5:** Create the stylesheet, `index.css`, with the content below.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/1_noAuthentication/index.css" lang="css"/>

Now the app is ready to run.

**Step 6:** Open a terminal in your project directory.

**Step 7:** Run the command below to start a Docker container with Node.js, or skip this step to run Node.js directly on your computer.

```sh
docker run --init -it --rm -p 3000:3000 --name "app" -v ".:/app" -w "/app" node:22.18-alpine3.21 sh
```

**Step 8:** Run the commands below to install the Node.js packages for React and then start the web server.

```sh
npm install  @fusionauth/react-sdk@~2.5.1  react@~19.1.1  react-dom@~19.1.1  react-router-dom@6.7.0

npm install --save-dev  @eslint/js@~9.33.0  @types/react@~19.1.10  eslint@~9.33.0  typescript@~5.9.2  typescript-eslint@~8.40.0  parcel@~2.15.4

npx parcel index.html --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
```

**Step 9:** Browse to http://localhost:3000 to see the site.

Because you haven't added authentication to the app yet, you can use the button at the top right to move freely between the homepage and account page.

## Download and run FusionAuth

Before adding authentication to the web app, you must start a local instance of FusionAuth.

**Step 10:** Download and run FusionAuth with Docker using the widget below.

<DownloadWidget kickstartEnabled={true} kickstartName={"quickstart-spa"} />

**Step 11:** Open http://localhost:9011/admin to check you can log in to the FusionAuth web interface. Use the following credentials:

- Username: `admin@example.com`
- Password: `password`

<Aside type="note">
In this example, FusionAuth has already been configured to communicate with an app on http://localhost:3000, where the example React app is running.

Your React app needs only a static web server because FusionAuth provides a [hosted backend](https://fusionauth.io/docs/apis/hosted-backend) for purely frontend apps.
</Aside>

## Add authentication to the app with FusionAuth

Now that FusionAuth is running, you must update the `.tsx` files to use FusionAuth authentication.

**Step 12:** Overwrite `index.tsx` with the content below.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/2_withAuthentication/index.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

The new `FusionAuthProviderConfig` section at the top of the file tells the `@fusionauth/react-sdk` where it can talk to FusionAuth. Because you've created a client-side app, not a server-side app, you don't need to hide any secrets in this section.

At the bottom of the code, `<FusionAuthProvider {...config}>` wraps the app and adds authentication features to all the components. To use those features, you must add a few lines to redirect the user to FusionAuth for login and to check whether they are logged in.

**Step 13:** Overwrite `home.tsx` with the content below.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/2_withAuthentication/home.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

The `useFusionAuth()` line adds helper functions to the homepage code. The user is redirected to the account page if `isLoggedIn` is true. The `startLogin()` line adds authentication to the login button.

That's all you need to do to provide authentication with FusionAuth.

**Step 14:** Overwrite `account.tsx` with the content below.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/2_withAuthentication/account.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

Similar to the homepage, `useFusionAuth()` adds the helper functions, and `startLogout()` adds authentication to the logout button. The `userinfo` object provides the user details for the account page.

**Step 15:** Reopen the app at http://localhost:3000 and ensure you've logged out of the admin@example.com account. Click the login button and log in with the new credentials (which were created automatically by the kickstart script):

- Username: `richard@example.com`
- Password: `password`

Note how the port number changes in the URL when the app redirects you to log in via the FusionAuth service and then returns you to the app (on port 3000).

![Account page](../../../public/img/quickstarts/quickstart-javascript-react-web/account.webp)

When you change the URL in the address bar to browse to the homepage or account page, you're redirected based on whether you're logged in or not. Authentication protects your private pages.
