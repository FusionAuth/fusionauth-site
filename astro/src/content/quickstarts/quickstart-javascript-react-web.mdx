## Overview

FusionAuth enables you to add login, registration, single sign-on (SSO), and multifactor authentication (MFA) to your app. This quickstart is your first step in discovering just how easy that can be.

You’ll create a simple React application, add login, and display user details. You’ll also install and run a local instance of FusionAuth — all in 15 minutes and 15 steps.

## Prerequisites

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is all you need to run FusionAuth and the React app.

If you prefer to run Node version [22](https://nodejs.org/en) directly on your computer, you can use that to run the React app.

If you want to view the final app created in this tutorial, you can download [the accompanying repository](https://github.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart), but it is not necessary. This repository has two directories:
- `1_noAuthentication`, which has the example app with placeholder pages with no authentication, and
- `2_withAuthentication`, which has the app with authentication provided by FusionAuth.

## Create a React app with no authentication

Let's start by creating a React app with no authentication. It will consist of three components:

- `index.tsx`, which is a container for the app and provides routing from one page to another.
- `home.tsx`, which is the login page.
- `account.tsx`, which shows the logged-in user's details.

You can create the following files anywhere you want, such as in a directory called `fusionauth-example-react-app`.

**Step 1:** Create  `index.html` with the content below.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/1_noAuthentication/index.html" lang="tsx"/>

All this file does is load the React app found in `src="/index.tsx"`, which you'll create next.

**Step 2:** Create `index.tsx` with the content below.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/1_noAuthentication/index.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

This landing component creates an `App` component that routes `/account` to the account component, and routes `/` and all other URLs to the home component. The code then uses React to insert the app into the page as the `root` element.

Next, let's create the home and account pages.

**Step 3:** Create `home.tsx` with the content below.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/1_noAuthentication/home.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

**Step 4:** Create `account.tsx` with the content below.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/1_noAuthentication/account.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

These two pages are placeholders for any content you want to add in future, with buttons that redirect the user from one page to the other with no authentication.

The last file you need to create is a stylesheet.

**Step 5:** Create `index.css` with the content below.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/1_noAuthentication/index.css" lang="css"/>

Now the app is ready to run.

**Step 6:** Open a terminal in the directory where you created the files above.

**Step 7:** Run the command below to start a Docker container with Node, or skip this step if you want to run Node directly on your computer.

```sh
docker run --init -it --rm -p 3000:3000 --name "app" -v ".:/app" -w "/app" node:22.18-alpine3.21 sh
```

**Step 8:** Run the commands below to install the Node packages for React and then start the app server with Vite.

```sh
npm install  @fusionauth/react-sdk@~2.5.1  react@~19.1.1  react-dom@~19.1.1  react-router-dom@~7.8.1

npm install --save-dev  @eslint/js@~9.33.0  @types/react@~19.1.10  @vitejs/plugin-react@~5.0.1  eslint@~9.33.0  typescript@~5.9.2  typescript-eslint@~8.40.0  vite@~7.1.3

npx vite --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
```

**Step 9:** Browse to http://localhost:3000 to see the site. You can use the button at the top right to move freely between the home and account pages, as there is no authentication yet.

## Download and run FusionAuth

Before you can add authentication to the web app, you need to start an instance of FusionAuth locally on your computer.

**Step 10:** Download and run FusionAuth with Docker using the widget below.

<DownloadWidget kickstartEnabled={true} kickstartName={"quickstart-spa"} />

**Step 11:** Check that you can log into the FusionAuth web interface at http://localhost:9011/admin with username `admin@example.com` and password `password`.

FusionAuth has already been configured in this example to communicate with an app on http://localhost:3000, which is where your example React app is running.

Your React app needs only a static web server, as FusionAuth provides a [hosted backend](https://fusionauth.io/docs/apis/hosted-backend) for purely frontend apps.

## Add authentication to the app with FusionAuth

Now that FusionAuth is running, let's update the `.tsx` files to authenticate with it.

**Step 12:** Overwrite `index.tsx` with the content below.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/2_withAuthentication/index.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

A new section, `FusionAuthProviderConfig`, is at the top of the file, which tells the `@fusionauth/react-sdk` where it can talk to FusionAuth. Since this is a client-side app, not server-side, you don't need to worry about hiding any secrets in this section.

At the bottom of the code, you can see that the app is now wrapped in `<FusionAuthProvider {...config}>`, which adds authentication features to all components inside the app. To use those features, you need to add a few lines to redirect the user to FusionAuth for login, and check if they are logged in.

**Step 13:** Overwrite `home.tsx` with the content below.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/2_withAuthentication/home.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

The `useFusionAuth()` line provides some helper functions to your code. The user is redirected to the account page if `isLoggedIn` is true. The login button now has authentication in a single line with `startLogin()`.

That's all you need to do to provide authentication with FusionAuth.

**Step 14:** Overwrite `account.tsx` with the content below.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/2_withAuthentication/account.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

The changes to the account page are almost the same as the home page. But the logout button has `startLogout()` instead of `startLogin()`. And user details are provided on the page using the `userinfo` object.

**Step 15:** Browse again to the app at http://localhost:3000. Log out of the admin@example.com account if you logged in to test your Fusionauth set up before. Click the login button and log in with user `richard@example.com` and password `password` (this was also created automatically by the kickstart script before). Note how the port number changes in your URL, as your app redirects you to the FusionAuth service to log in, and then back to the app (on port 3000) once that step is complete.

![Account page](../../../public/img/quickstarts/quickstart-javascript-react-web/account.webp)

You can see that if you change the URL in the address bar to browse to the account or home page, you'll be redirected back again based on whether you're logged in or not. Authentication protects your private pages.
