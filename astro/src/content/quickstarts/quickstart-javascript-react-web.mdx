## Overview

In this tutorial you'll learn how to use FusionAuth to provide authentication for your app. You'll create a React web app with two pages:
- A home page with a login button.
- An account page that displays the logged-in user's details.

Only a static web server will be used, as FusionAuth provides a [hosted backend](https://fusionauth.io/docs/apis/hosted-backend) for purely frontend apps.

## Prerequisites

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is all you need to run FA and the React app.

If you prefer to run Node version [22](https://nodejs.org/en) directly on your computer, you can use that to run the React app.

If you want to view the final app created in this tutorial, you can download [the repository](https://github.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart), but it is not necessary.

You need no particular skills to follow this tutorial, but the explanations assume you have basic familiarity with developing single page apps in JavaScript.

## Create A React App With No Authentication

Let's start by creating a React app with no authentication. It will consist of three components:
- `index.tsx`, which is a container for the app and provides routing from one page to another.
- `home.tsx`, which is the login page.
- `account.tsx`, which shows the logged-in user's details.

▶️ Create `index.html` with the content below.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/1_noAuthentication/index.html" lang="tsx"/>

All this file does is load the React app found in `src="/index.tsx"`, which you'll create next.

▶️ Create `index.tsx` with the content below.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/1_noAuthentication/index.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

This landing component creates and `App` component that routes `/account` to the account component, and `/` and all other URLs to the home component. The code then uses React to insert the app into the page as the `root` element.

Next, let's create the home and account pages.

▶️ Create `home.tsx` with the content below.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/1_noAuthentication/home.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

▶️ Create `account.tsx` with the content below.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/1_noAuthentication/account.tsx" lang="tsx"/>

These two pages are just placeholders, with buttons that redirect the user from one page to the other with no authentication.

The last file you need to create is a stylesheet.

▶️ Create `index.css` with the content below.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/draft_overhaulReactQuickstart/1_noAuthentication/index.css" lang="css"/>

Now the app is ready to run. Let's start it.

▶️ Open a terminal in the directory where you created the files above.

▶️ Run the command below to start a Docker container with Node, or skip this step if you want to run Node directly on your computer.

```sh
docker run --init -it --rm -p 3000:3000 --name "app" -v ".:/app" -w "/app" node:22.18-alpine3.21 sh
```

▶️ Run the commands below in the Docker terminal you opened (or in a normal terminal on your computer).

```sh
npm install TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO
npx vite --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
```

The commands above install the Node packages for React and the start the app server with Vite.

## Create the app with no authentication

- create package.jsonm, main.css, home.tsx, account.tsx
- run commands
```sh
docker network create faNetwork
docker run --init  -it --rm --network "faNetwork" -p 3000:3000 --name "app" -v ".:/app" -w "/app" node:22.18-alpine3.21 sh

# Run the commands below in Docker
npm install
npx vite --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
```
browse to http://localhost:3000 to check

## Setup a FusionAuth server
  Download, configure, and run a FusionAuth server on the local machine
  NOTE: This needs to be as simple as possible. Additionally, there’s no information on publishing to the internet.

```sh
docker compose up
```

## Add Authentication to the app

- set authorized redirect url to local:3000

  Add the login/register and logout code that’s used by the UX
  Add code to the homepage
  Add code to the Account page
    Show user email in title bar
    Handle logout
    Static example for returned information but no functionality
## Add display of user data
  Add the code used by the UX to query the user data
  Add code to Show My Info button that uses the code from (a)
  Modify the displayed list so that it shows only when there’s data
## Next steps
  Where can they go for more info (Getting Started)
  Possibly invite them to explore more, for example adding branding to the redirect pages.
  NOTE: Keep this section short

## Getting Started

In this section, you'll get FusionAuth up and running and use React CLI to create a new application.

### Clone the Code
First off, grab the code from the repository and change into that directory.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web
```

### Run FusionAuth via Docker


{/* <DockerSpinup kickstartUri={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} /> */}

### Create a basic React application

Now you are going to create a basic React application using the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). While this section builds a simple React application, you can use the same configuration to integrate your existing React application with FusionAuth.

```shell
npm create vite@latest changebank -- --template react-ts && cd changebank
```
<Aside type="note">
    The FusionAuth server is configured with the valid redirect URI of localhost:3000. Ensure your changebank app runs on this port by adding `server: { port: 3000 }` to your `vite.config.ts`.
</Aside>

We are going to use the [Hosted Backend](/docs/apis/hosted-backend) feature of FusionAuth, so you don't need to worry about setting up a backend server.

<Aside type="caution">
While this example uses localhost for your application and FusionAuth, there are complications if you plan to deploy using FusionAuth Cloud.

  <HostedBackendWarning />
</Aside>

Install the FusionAuth React SDK, and React Router, which we'll use to manage the routes in our application:

```shell
npm install @fusionauth/react-sdk react-router-dom
```

Next, you'll need to configure the SDK with your FusionAuth URL, client Id, and redirect URI. You can do this by updating `src/main.tsx`:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/main/complete-application/src/main.tsx"
            lang="tsx"/>

We also set up the `BrowserRouter` from React Router, which will allow us to use the `Routes` and `Route` component to define the routes later.

Our example application is going to have a home page and an account page. The account page will be protected and only visible to logged in users.

#### Create a Home Page

The next step is to get a basic home page up and running. We’ll take this opportunity to copy in all the images and CSS style files that you’ll need for the application.

Run the following copy commands to copy these files from the quickstart repo into your project. This assumes that you checked the quickstart repo out into the parent directory. If that’s not the case, replace the `..` below with your actual repo location.

```shell
cp -r ../complete-application/src/assets src && \
cp -r ../complete-application/src/index.css src
```

The home page will be a simple page with a welcome message and a login link. Create a new directory `pages` under `src`, in that directory create a new file `src/pages/HomePage.tsx`:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/main/complete-application/src/pages/HomePage.tsx"
            lang="tsx"/>

#### Create an Account Page

The account page will be a simple page that displays a random balance for the logged in user. Create a new file `src/pages/AccountPage.tsx`:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/main/complete-application/src/pages/AccountPage.tsx"
            lang="tsx"/>

#### Create A Make Change Page

The make change page will be a simple page that displays an input field for the user to enter a dollar amount and a button to convert that amount into coins. Create a new file `src/pages/MakeChangePage.tsx`:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/main/complete-application/src/pages/MakeChangePage.tsx"
            lang="tsx"/>

## Authentication

You now have created a basic React application with a home page and an account page.

Depending on the user's authentication state, the login or logout button should be displayed in the header. For this create a new directory `components` in `src` and a new file `src/components/LogoHeader.tsx`:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/main/complete-application/src/components/LogoHeader.tsx"
            lang="tsx"/>

Additionally, we want to display different menu items. For this create a new file `src/components/MenuBar.tsx`:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/main/complete-application/src/components/MenuBar.tsx"
            lang="tsx"/>

The next step is to tie it all together. Update the `src/App.tsx` file by replacing its content with the following code:

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-react-web/main/complete-application/src/App.tsx"
            lang="tsx"/>

## Running the Application

You can now run the application with the following command:

```shell
npm start
```

You can now open up an incognito window and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You will be greeted with the home page. Log in with the user account you created when setting up FusionAuth, and you'll be redirected to the account page.

<Aside type="note">
    The username and password of the `example user` can be found in the <a href="#run-fusionauth-via-docker">FusionAuth via Docker</a> section at the top of this article.

- why button on account page?
- no point to creating a blank account page that we can't browse then later overwriting it
