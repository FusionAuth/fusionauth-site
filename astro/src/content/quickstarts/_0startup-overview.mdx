Welcome! At the end of this guide, you will know how to add login (sign in) and logout (sign out) to a Node.js application, using Express and Pug.

## Intro to FusionAuth 

When using FusionAuth, when your user begins the authentication process, you typically send them to FusionAuth. FusionAuth authenticates them and returns them to your application with a token indicating the login was successful.

## General Architecture

<LoginArchitectureSdk />

With this architecture:

* FusionAuth is the **only** system that sees confidential credentials such as passwords.
* You can add multi-factor authentication (MFA) and other security features in one place.
* Adding, removing and auditing users' application access occurs in FusionAuth.
* Pre-built functionality like registration, single sign-on, and profile management speeds application development.

FusionAuth is available both as an installable piece of software and a SaaS service, so you have options. The software functionality is the same no matter where you run it.

## Choose Your Own Adventure

One of FusionAuth's unique attributes is the variety of places you can install it. Bare metal, cloud, container: yup. Windows, macOS, Linux: sure! You can learn more about [different options in the installation guide](/docs/get-started/download-and-install). But for this guide, you'll pick one of three options.

First, please choose a launch option to get your FusionAuth instance up and running:

<BlogButton label="Gitpod" href="/docs/quickstarts/launch-cloud" /><span class="mr-3" />
<BlogButton label="Docker" href="/docs/quickstarts/launch-docker" /><span class="mr-3" />
<BlogButton label="Local" href="/docs/quickstarts/launch-local" /><span class="mr-3" />

* [Gitpod](/docs/quickstarts/launch-cloud) creates a cloud-hosted instance for FusionAuth.  This means you don't need to install anything on your local system.  Works best in Chrome.
* [Docker](/docs/quickstarts/5-minute-docker) requires docker and docker compose. This is the best choice if you have docker and docker compose installed.
* [Local](/docs/quickstarts/5-minute-fastpath) requires a local database (such as PostgreSQL). This is the best option if you have a local database installed and want to get the full installation experience.

Each of these options will end up at the same place; you'll be ready to interact with FusionAuth to manage access to an application.

The second step is to pick the kind of interaction you want to have:

<BlogButton label="Web" href="/docs/quickstarts/setup-web" />
<BlogButton label="Docker" href="/docs/quickstarts/setup-api" />

* [Web](/docs/quickstarts/setup-web) uses the FusionAuth web interface to configure access for your website.
* [API](/docs/quickstarts/setup-api) lets you look under the hood and make your configuration changes via FusionAuth's API.

Feel free to try both to build up your FusionAuth knowledge.

After you've finished the Startup modules, you can dig deeper into a number of areas.
