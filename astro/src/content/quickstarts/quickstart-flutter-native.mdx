In this quickstart, you will build a Flutter mobile application and integrate it with FusionAuth. The application is for [ChangeBank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkH-kD73QUM), a global leader in converting dollars into coins. It will have areas reserved for logged in users and public-facing sections. It uses Flutter and sets up an OAuth authorization code grant flow, allowing users to log in to the application.

Find the Docker Compose file and source code for the complete application at https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-flutter-native.

## Prerequisites

For this Quickstart, you'll need.

* [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
* If you want to develop applications for iOS:
    - Xcode.
    - iPhone simulator or real iOS device.
    - [iPhone development environment](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos#ios-setup).
* If you want to develop applications for Android:
    - Android emulator or real Android device.
    - [Android development environment](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos#android-setup).

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com), which is the quickest way to start FusionAuth. (There are [other ways](/docs/get-started/download-and-install)).

To make sure your Flutter development environment is working correctly, run the following command in your terminal window.

```shell
flutter doctor
```

If everything is configured properly, you will see something like the following result in your terminal window:

```shell
Doctor summary (to see all details, run flutter doctor -v):
[✓] Flutter (Channel stable, 3.13.12)
[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 34.0.0)
[✓] Xcode - develop for iOS and macOS (Xcode 14.3.1)
[✓] Chrome - develop for the web
[✓] Android Studio (version 2022.3)
[✓] IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (version 2022.2)
[✓] Connected device (2 available)
[✓] Network resources

• No issues found!
```

## General Architecture

While this sample application doesn't have login functionality without FusionAuth, a more typical integration will replace an existing login system with FusionAuth.

In that case, the system might look like this before FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginBefore alt={"Request flow during login before FusionAuth"}/>

The login flow will look like this after FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginAfter alt={"Request flow during login after FusionAuth"}/>

In general, you would introduce FusionAuth to normalize and consolidate user data, ensuring consistency and reliability, while offloading your login security and functionality to FusionAuth.

## Getting Started

Start by getting FusionAuth up and running and creating a Flutter application.


### Clone The Code

First, grab the code from the repository and change into that directory.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-flutter-native.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-flutter-native
```

All shell commands in this guide can be entered in a terminal in this folder. On Windows, you need to replace forward slashes with backslashes in paths.

The files you'll create in this guide already exist in the `complete-application` folder, if you prefer to copy them.


### Run FusionAuth Via Docker

You'll find a Docker Compose file `docker-compose.yml` and an environment variables configuration file `.env` in the root directory of the repo.

Assuming you have Docker installed, you can start FusionAuth on your machine with the following.

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

This will start three containers, one each for FusionAuth, Postgres, and Elasticsearch.

Here you are using a bootstrapping feature of FusionAuth, called [Kickstart](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/kickstart). When FusionAuth starts for the first time, it will look at the `kickstart/kickstart.json` file and configure FusionAuth to your specified state.

<Aside type="note">
If you ever want to reset the FusionAuth system, delete the volumes created by `docker-compose` by executing `docker compose down -v`, then rerun `docker compose up -d`.
</Aside>

FusionAuth will be configured with these settings:

* Your client Id is `e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e`.
* Your client secret is `super-secret-secret-that-should-be-regenerated-for-production`.
* Your example username is `richard@example.com` and the password is `password`.
* Your admin username is `admin@example.com` and the password is `password`.
* The base URL of FusionAuth is `http://localhost:9011/`.

You can log in to the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin) and look around if you want to, but with Docker and Kickstart, everything will already be configured correctly.

<Aside type="caution">
  The `.env` and `kickstart.json` files contain passwords. In a real application, always add these files to your `.gitignore` file and never commit secrets to version control.
</Aside>


### Set Up A Public URL For FusionAuth

Your FusionAuth instance is now running on a different machine (your computer) than the mobile app will run (either a real device or an emulator), which means that it won't be able to access `localhost`.

If the device and your computer are not connected to the same network or if you have something that blocks connections (like a firewall), learn [how to expose a local FusionAuth instance to the internet](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/exposing-instance).
In summary, the process entails configuring [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) on your local system, [starting your FusionAuth instance on port 9011](#run-fusionauth-via-docker), and subsequently executing the following command.

```shell
ngrok http --request-header-add 'X-Forwarded-Port:443' 9011
```

This will generate a public URL that you can use to access FusionAuth when developing the app.

If the device (either real or emulator) and your computer are connected to the same network, you can use the local IP Address for your machine (for example, `192.168.15.2`). Here are a few articles to help you find your IP address, depending on the operating system you are running:

- [Linux](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-find-ip-address-linux/#find-your-public-ip-address)
- [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/find-your-computers-name-and-network-address-mchlp1177/mac)
- [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/find-your-ip-address-in-windows-f21a9bbc-c582-55cd-35e0-73431160a1b9)


### Create Your Flutter Application

In the directory where the project should live, run the following command to create and set up the new Flutter app.

```shell
flutter create --org com.fusionauth flutterdemo --platforms=ios,android
```

After the installation process completes, you will see that the `flutterdemo` directory contains all the Flutter starter app configuration. Open the project directory with the text editor of your choice.

You can run your new project on the actual device or an emulator to confirm everything is working before you customize any code. Do so by running the following command in the project directory.

```shell
cd flutterdemo
flutter run
```

From the list of emulators or devices that can be used, choose the one that you want to run the code on.
Stay in this directory for the rest of this tutorial.
Stay in this directory for the rest of this tutorial.

To run the project on iOS and Android together, you can use the following command.

```shell
flutter run -d all
```

The build process takes a while the first time an app is built. After a successful build, you will get the boilerplate Flutter app running in your emulators.

Now that you have a basic working application running, you can add authentication.

## Authentication

[AppAuth](https://appauth.io/) is a popular OAuth package that can be used in both native and cross-platform mobile applications. In this project, you will be storing the access token using the secure storage package. Since such tokens allow your application to access protected resources such as APIs, you need to take care they are stored as securely as possible.

Run the command below to install the project dependencies.

```shell
flutter pub add http flutter_appauth flutter_secure_storage flutter_svg
```

The packages added to the application with the command above do the following:

* The `http` package provides a way for the Flutter application to interact with web services and APIs.
* `flutter_appauth` allows you to perform OAuth 2.0 authentication flows in the application.
* `flutter_secure_storage` provides a secure storage for sensitive data like tokens in Flutter apps.
* `flutter_svg`  allows you to render Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) images in your application. You will make use of the package to render the application logo.

### Setting Up AppAuth

Now you can add the previously configured callback URL to the Android and iOS directories with native configuration.

Let's look at Android first.

#### Android Setup

In your editor, go to the `android/app/build.gradle` file for your Android app to specify the custom redirect scheme. Find the code block similar to the code below and add `com.fusionauth.flutterdemo` as the `appAuthRedirectScheme` in the `manifestPlaceholders` array.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-flutter-native/main/complete-application/android/app/build.gradle"
 lang="text" tags="appAuthRedirectScheme" />

#### iOS Setup

Now edit the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file in the iOS app to specify the custom scheme. Find the section that looks similar to the following and add the FusionAuth URL `com.fusionauth.flutterdemo`.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-flutter-native/main/complete-application/ios/Runner/Info.plist"
 lang="xml" />

Make sure the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file has `CFBundleURLTypes` and `CFBundleURLSchemes` keys as in the code above.

### Dive Into The Code

Open the `main.dart` file in the `lib` directory of your project and paste the contents below into it.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-flutter-native/main/complete-application/lib/main.dart"
 lang="dart" />

<Aside type="tip">
Putting all your logic in one file makes sense for a tutorial but for a larger application, you'll probably want to split it up.
</Aside>

At the top of the file, change the `FUSIONAUTH_DOMAIN` constant to the public URL for your FusionAuth instance ([the URL you used when configuring it](#set-up-a-public-url-for-fusionauth)).

For security, this code uses the system browser instead of an embedded webview. [Current mobile best practices for OAuth](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252) require you to use the system browser rather than a webview, as a webview is controlled by the native application displaying it. From section 8.12 of that document:

<Aside type="note">
This best current practice requires that native apps MUST NOT use embedded user-agents to perform authorization requests and allows that authorization endpoints MAY take steps to detect and block authorization requests in embedded user-agents.
</Aside>

## Customization

The final step is to add a logo to be displayed in the app. To do that, run the following commands.

```shell
mkdir assets
curl -o assets/example_bank_logo.svg https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-flutter-native/main/complete-application/assets/example_bank_logo.svg
```

In `pubspec.yaml`, add an `assets` section that will allow the logo to be copied over to the application.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-flutter-native/main/complete-application/pubspec.yaml"
 lang="yaml" tags="addAsset"/>

## Run The Application

Start up your emulators or real devices again.

```shell
flutter run -d all
```

Log in using `richard@example.com` and `password`.

## Next Steps

This quickstart is a great way to get a proof of concept up and running quickly, but to run your application in production, there are some things you're going to want to do.

### FusionAuth Customization
FusionAuth gives you the ability to customize just about everything with the user's experience and your application's integration. This includes
* [Hosted pages](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/) such as login, registration, email verification, and many more
* [Email templates](/docs/customize/email-and-messages/email-templates)
* [User data and custom claims in access token JWTs](/articles/tokens/jwt-components-explained)

### Security

* You may want to customize the [token expiration times and policies](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/#configure-application-oauth-settings) in FusionAuth
* Choose [password rules](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/tenants#password) and a [hashing algorithm](/docs/reference/password-hashes) that meet your security needs

### Tenant And Application Management

* Model your application topology using [Applications](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/applications), [Roles](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/roles), [Groups](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/groups), [Entities](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/groups), and more
* Set up [MFA](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/multi-factor-authentication), [Social login](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/identity-providers/), and/or [SAML](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/identity-providers/overview-samlv2) integrations
* Integrate with external systems using [Webhooks](/docs/extend/events-and-webhooks/), [SCIM](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/scim/scim), and [Lambdas](/docs/extend/code/lambdas/)

### Additional Resources

Want to dive in further? Here are some additional resources for understanding auth in Flutter and mobile applications.

* [Flutter AppAuth Plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_appauth)
* [FusionAuth Dart Client Library](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-dart-client)
* [Native app OAuth best practices](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252)

## Troubleshooting

* I get `Error retrieving discovery document: A server with the specified hostname could not be found` when I click the login button.

Ensure FusionAuth is running on a publicly accessible URL and that the `FUSIONAUTH_DOMAIN` variable in `main.dart` is set to the correct URL of your FusionAuth instance.

* I get `Resolving dependencies... Because flutterdemo requires SDK version >=3.0.0 <4.0.0, version solving failed.`

Ensure you have the latest Flutter version and that the version of Dart is greater than 3.0.0 by running the following command.

```
flutter upgrade
```
