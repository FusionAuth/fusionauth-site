<Intro fulltext="an iOS app with Swift and SwiftUI"
       repositoryUrl="https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-swift-ios-native-appauth"/>

## Prerequisites

- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/): The official IDE for iOS development. Install it from the Mac App Store.
- An Apple Developer account (optional): For running your app on a device and publishing your app. You can still develop and test the app in a simulator without an account.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com): The quickest way to stand up FusionAuth (there are [other ways](/docs/get-started/download-and-install).) Ensure you also have [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.

This app was built using [AppAuth](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-ios), an open-source client SDK for communicating with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect providers. AppAuth supports iOS 7 and newer.

## General Architecture

<LoginArchitectureWeb />

## Getting Started

In this section, you'll get FusionAuth up and running and use Git to create a new application.

### Clone The Code

First, grab the code from the repository and change to that directory.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-swift-ios-native-appauth
cd fusionauth-quickstart-swift-ios-native-appauth
```

### Run FusionAuth Via Docker

<DockerSpinup kickstartUri={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} />

### Set Up A Public URL For FusionAuth

<QuickstartNgrok />

### Create Your iOS App

Now you will create an iOS app. While this section builds a simple iOS app using [AppAuth](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-ios), you can use the same configuration to integrate your existing app with FusionAuth.

Open Xcode and click <Breadcrumb>File -> New Project</Breadcrumb>. Choose "iOS" as the platform, and "App" as the application type. Click <InlineUIElement>Next</InlineUIElement>.

Set <Field label="Product Name"/> to `ChangeBank`. Set the <Field label="Organization Identifier"/> to `FusionAuth`.

<Aside type="note">
  If you use different values here, you will need to update the redirect URLs in your FusionAuth application to match your changes.
</Aside>

Click <InlineUIElement>Next</InlineUIElement>, and choose a location on your computer to save the project to.

Now you have a standard "Hello World" app. You can run it in the simulator by clicking the play button in the top left corner of Xcode or selecting <Breadcrumb>Product -> Run</Breadcrumb> from the menu bar.

## Authentication

You'll use the [AppAuth Library](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-ios), which simplifies integrating with FusionAuth and creating a secure web application.

### Add The AppAuth Library

There are many ways to add the AppAuth library to your project. The simplest way without installing any additional tools is to add the package to the project. 

Select <Breadcrumb>File -> Add Package Dependency</Breadcrumb> from the menu bar. In the search bar, paste in `https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-ios`. In the list of packages select "appauth-ios" and click <InlineUIElement>Add Package</InlineUIElement>. You will be asked to choose the packages to install. On the "Add to Target" column select `Changebank` for both "AppAuth" and "AppAuthCore". Click <InlineUIElement>Add Package</InlineUIElement> to add the packages to your project.

## Customization

Before you start coding, you need to add some assets and styles to your project that will be referenced later.

### Add Assets And Styles

Add the ChangeBank logo to the project. Download it from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-swift-ios-native-appauth/main/complete-application/ChangeBank/Assets.xcassets/changebank.imageset/changebank.png). Click on the <InlineUIElement>Assets</InlineUIElement> directory in the project navigator to open the asset manager. Drag and drop the downloaded `changebank.png` file into the asset manager.

Add an app icon. Download it from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-swift-ios-native-appauth/main/complete-application/ChangeBank/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/AppIcon.png). Click on the <InlineUIElement>Assets</InlineUIElement> directory in the project navigator to open the asset manager. Click the <InlineUIElement>AppIcon</InlineUIElement> item in the asset manager. Now drag and drop the downloaded `AppIcon.png` file into the AppIcon placeholder in the asset manager.

Add a new styles file to the project. Select <Breadcrumb>File -> New -> File</Breadcrumb> from the menu bar. Select <InlineUIElement>Swift File</InlineUIElement> as the template. Click <InlineUIElement>Next</InlineUIElement>. Set the name of the file to `Styles.swift`. Click <InlineUIElement>Create</InlineUIElement>.

Add the following code to the `Styles.swift` file:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/ChangeBank/Styles.swift"}
            lang="swift"/>

### Add A P-List File

To store the settings necessary to connect to the FusionAuth instance, you need to add a Property List file (or "p-list file" for short) to the project. None of the settings stored are sensitive, so you can safely store them in an unencrypted p-list file.

Select <Breadcrumb>File -> New -> File</Breadcrumb> from the menu bar. Select <InlineUIElement>Property List</InlineUIElement> in the <Breadcrumb>Resource</Breadcrumb> section as the template. Click <InlineUIElement>Next</InlineUIElement>. Set the name of the file to `ChangeBank`. Click <InlineUIElement>Create</InlineUIElement>. The file will be opened in the p-list editor.

Expand the "Root" item by clicking the arrow <InlineUIElement>></InlineUIElement> button, then click the <InlineUIElement>+</InlineUIElement> button next to the "Root" item. Name the new item `authCredentials`, and select the <Field label="Type"/> as `Dictionary`.

Now click the <InlineUIElement>+</InlineUIElement> button next to the "authCredentials" item. Name the new item `clientId`, and select the <Field label="Type"/> as `String`. In the "Value" column, enter `e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e`.

Expand the "authCredentials" item by clicking the arrow <InlineUIElement>></InlineUIElement> button. Click the <InlineUIElement>+</InlineUIElement> button next to the "authCredentials" item again. Name the new item `issuer`, and select the <Field label="Type"/> as `String`. In the "Value" column, enter `http://localhost:9011`.

To read the settings from the p-list file, you need to add a new class to the project. Select <Breadcrumb>File -> New -> File</Breadcrumb> from the menu bar. Select <InlineUIElement>Swift File</InlineUIElement> as the template and click <InlineUIElement>Next</InlineUIElement>. Set the name of the file to `AppSettingsReader.swift`. Click <InlineUIElement>Create</InlineUIElement>.

Add the following code to the `AppSettingsReader.swift` file:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/ChangeBank/AppSettingsReader.swift"}
            lang="swift"/>

This code adds new structs to hold the credentials and issuer settings, and a class to read the settings from the p-list file. 

### Implement AppAuth Logic

The AppAuth library was built for [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit). To use it in a SwiftUI app, you need to implement some bridge logic between the two frameworks.

The main component to add is an `AppDelegate` class. This class will be responsible for coordinating the breakout browser window to handle the OAuth flow and interfacing with AppAuth. 

Select <Breadcrumb>File -> New -> File</Breadcrumb> from the menu bar. Select <InlineUIElement>Swift File</InlineUIElement> as the template. Click <InlineUIElement>Next</InlineUIElement>. Set the name of the file to `AppDelegate.swift`. Click <InlineUIElement>Create</InlineUIElement>.

Add the following code to the `AppDelegate.swift` file:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/ChangeBank/AppDelegate.swift"}
            lang="swift"/>

The `AppDelegate` class extends `UIResponder` and adopts the `UIApplicationDelegate` protocol, which means it listens for events in the iOS app's lifecycle. 

In the `application(_ app:UIApplication open url: URL options: )` method, the code checks if the URL being opened corresponds to an authorization flow and, if so, it tries to resume this flow. This flow relates to the situation where a user has completed a login or logout function in a web browser and the app is reopened via a callback URL from FusionAuth. The `resumeExternalUserAgentFlow(with:)` method is a part of AppAuth that handles the incoming URL and determines whether it corresponds to the AppAuth flow that was initiated, proceeding with the process if it matches.

The next step is to add an authentication flow manager class to the app. This class will be responsible for discovering the auth server endpoints and keys, initiating login and logout flows, and handling the results of those flows. It will also be responsible for storing the user's authentication state and retrieving the user's profile information from FusionAuth.

Select the <Breadcrumb>File -> New -> File</Breadcrumb> from the menu bar. Select <InlineUIElement>Swift File</InlineUIElement> as the template. Click <InlineUIElement>Next</InlineUIElement>. Set the name of the file to `UserAuth.swift`. Click <InlineUIElement>Create</InlineUIElement>.

Copy the following code into the `UserAuth.swift` file:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/ChangeBank/UserAuth.swift"}
            lang="swift"/>

Since the `UserAuth` class will be used by multiple views to determine the user's logged in status and profile information, it is declared as an `ObservableObject`. This means that any SwiftUI views that use the `UserAuth` class will be notified when the `UserAuth` object changes. As we only want one instance of the `UserAuth` class, it should be instantiated in the main `App` class, and passed to the views that need it via the root view [`environmentObject` method](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/environmentobject(_:)). This will make the `UserAuth` object available to all child views of the root view, and any views that need to access the `UserAuth` object can declare it as an `@EnvironmentObject` property.

Update the `App` class in the `ChangBankApp.swift` file to instantiate the `UserAuth` object and pass it to the root view:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/ChangeBank/ChangeBankApp.swift"}
            lang="swift"/>

### Create The `ContentView` View

The `ContentView` view is the root view of the app that will display the login screen if the user is not logged in, or the main app screens if the user is logged in. The `UserAuth` object is accessed via the `@EnvironmentObject` property wrapper, and the `isLoggedIn` property is used to determine which view to display.

Update the `ContentView` class in the `ContentView.swift` file as follows.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/ChangeBank/ContentView.swift"}
            lang="swift"/>

### Create The `LoginView` View

The `LoginView` view is displayed when the user is not logged in and contains a button that initiates the login flow. The `UserAuth` object is accessed via the `@EnvironmentObject` property wrapper, and the `login` method is called when the login button is pressed.

Select <Breadcrumb>File -> New -> File</Breadcrumb> from the menu bar. Select <InlineUIElement>Swift File</InlineUIElement> as the template. Click <InlineUIElement>Next</InlineUIElement>. Set the name of the file to `LoginView.swift`. Click <InlineUIElement>Create</InlineUIElement>.

Copy the following code into the `LoginView.swift` file:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/ChangeBank/LoginView.swift"}
            lang="swift"/>

### Add The Logged In Home View

The `HomeView` view is displayed when the user is logged in. It greets the user by their name, retrieved from FusionAuth, and contains a button that initiates the logout flow. The `UserAuth` object is accessed via the `@EnvironmentObject` property wrapper, and its `logout` method is called when the logout button is pressed.

Select <Breadcrumb>File -> New -> File</Breadcrumb> from the menu bar. Select <InlineUIElement>Swift File</InlineUIElement> as the template. Click <InlineUIElement>Next</InlineUIElement>. Set the name of the file to `HomeView.swift`. Click <InlineUIElement>Create</InlineUIElement>.

Copy the following code into the `HomeView.swift` file:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/ChangeBank/HomeView.swift"}
            lang="swift"/>

### Add The Make Change View

ChangeBank's main business is to convert your notes to coins. The `MakeChangeView` view is available when the user is logged in. It takes an amount in dollars and returns the equivalent amount in nickels and pennies. 

Select <Breadcrumb>File -> New -> File</Breadcrumb> from the menu bar. Select <InlineUIElement>Swift File</InlineUIElement> as the template. Click <InlineUIElement>Next</InlineUIElement>. Set the name of the file to `MakeChangeView.swift`. Click <InlineUIElement>Create</InlineUIElement>.

Copy the following code into the `MakeChangeView.swift` file.

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/ChangeBank/MakeChangeView.swift"}
            lang="swift"/>

## Run The Application

You can run the application on a simulator or iOS device.

### Running The App On A Simulator

To run the app in the simulator, click the play button in the top-left corner of Xcode or select <Breadcrumb>Product -> Run</Breadcrumb> from the menu bar. The app will be built and run in the simulator.

Click <InlineUIElement>Login</InlineUIElement>. You should see a system notification, and then be redirected to FusionAuth in a popup browser. Log in with the username `richard@example.com` and the password `password`. You should see the home screen displaying your name, your balance, and a logout button.

At the bottom of the screen, you'll see a tab bar with two tabs. Click the <Breadcrumb>Make Change</Breadcrumb> tab. Enter an amount in dollars, and click <InlineUIElement>Make Change</InlineUIElement>. You should see the equivalent amount in nickels and pennies displayed.

Navigate back to the home screen by clicking the <Breadcrumb>Home</Breadcrumb> tab. Click <InlineUIElement>Logout</InlineUIElement>. You should see another system notification and then be redirected to FusionAuth to log out. Finally, you'll be returned to the login screen.

### Running The App On A Device

To run the app on your device, you need to make a few changes. This is because the app will be running on a different device to the FusionAuth instance, so it won't be able to access the FusionAuth instance via `localhost`.

A simple way to get around this is to use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), a tool that allows you to expose a local server to the internet. You can follow the [guide here](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/exposing-instance). Note the URL ngrok gave you as you'll need it soon.

Now that you have the URL, you need to update the FusionAuth Tenant issuer to make sure it matches the given address.

Log in to the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin), browse to <Breadcrumb>Tenants</Breadcrumb> in the sidebar, and click <IconButton icon="edit" color="blue" /> on the "Default" tenant to edit it. Paste the complete address _(with protocol and domain)_ you copied from ngrok into the <Field label="Issuer"/> field (for example, `https://6d1e-2804-431-c7c9-739-4703-98a7-4b81-5ba6.ngrok-free.app`). Save the tenant by clicking the <IconButton icon="save" color="blue" /> icon in the top-right corner.

Navigate to <Breadcrumb>Applications</Breadcrumb> and click <IconButton icon="edit" color="blue" /> on the "Example Apple SwiftUI iOS App" application. Click on the <Breadcrumb>JWT</Breadcrumb> tab, change both <Field label="Access token signing key"/> and <Field label="Id token signing key"/> to `Auto generate a new key on save...` and save the application.

<Aside type="note">
  You must create new keys after modifying the Tenant because the Issuer field is embedded in the key.
</Aside>

Now you need to update the `ChangeBank.plist` file to use the ngrok URL. Open the `ChangeBank.plist` file in the project navigator, and change the value of the `issuer` key to the ngrok URL.

Now you can run the app on your device. Connect your device to your computer via USB. In Xcode, select your device from the device menu in the top-left corner of the window. Click the play button in the top left corner of Xcode, or select <Breadcrumb>Product -> Run</Breadcrumb> from the menu bar. The app will be built and run on your device.

Note that you need to enable [developer mode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-developer-mode-on-a-device) on your device to run the app there. You will also need to associate a developer team with your Xcode project. You can do this by selecting the project file in the project navigator and selecting your team in the <Breadcrumb>Signing & Capabilities</Breadcrumb> tab. If you don't have a developer account, you can use your personal Apple ID as the team.

    * Implement refresh tokens using [AppAuth](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-ios).
  </Fragment>
</NextSteps>

## Troubleshooting

* I can't log in.

Make sure you have the right values in the `ChangeBank.plist` file. Double-check the `Issuer` in the **Tenant** to make sure it matches the public URL that FusionAuth is running at.

- It still doesn't work.

You can always pull down a complete running application and compare what's different.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-swift-ios-native-appauth.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-swift-ios-native-appauth
docker compose up
```

Then open and run the Xcode project in the `complete-application` directory.
