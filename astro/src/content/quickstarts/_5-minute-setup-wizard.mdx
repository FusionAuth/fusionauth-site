Once FusionAuth starts up successfully, you will be taken to the Setup Wizard. This is where you will create the administrator account for FusionAuth and accept the license. 

**Record the email and password** you choose for the administrator account. You won't be able to recover this without setting up an email server, which is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

You can also sign up for the FusionAuth newsletter, which is a great way to stay up-to-date on FusionAuth releases and new features. We will never pitch you, hard-sell or sell your information, so feel free to sign up.

Here's what the Setup Wizard page looks like.

Clicking **Submit** here will complete the Setup Wizard and log you into the FusionAuth administrative user interface.
