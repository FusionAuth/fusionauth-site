In this quickstart, you will build an application with {frontmatter.technology} and integrate it with FusionAuth. The application is for [ChangeBank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkH-kD73QUM), a global leader in converting dollars into coins. It will have areas reserved for logged in users and public-facing sections.

Find the Docker Compose file and source code for the complete application at <a href={frontmatter.url}>{frontmatter.url}</a>.

## Prerequisites

For this Quickstart, you'll need:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com), version 20 or later, which is the quickest way to start FusionAuth. (There are [other ways](/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/)).

## General Architecture

While this sample application doesn't have login functionality without FusionAuth, a more typical integration will replace an existing login system with FusionAuth.

In that case, the system might look like this before FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginBefore alt={"Request flow during login before FusionAuth"}/>

The login flow will look like this after FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginAfter alt={"Request flow during login after FusionAuth"}/>

In general, you would introduce FusionAuth to normalize and consolidate user data, making it consistent and up-to-date and offloading your login security and functionality to FusionAuth.

## Getting Started

Start with getting FusionAuth up and running and creating a new {frontmatter.technology} application.

### Clone The Code

First, grab the code from the repository and change into that folder.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-php-laravel-web.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-php-laravel-web
```

All shell commands in this guide can be entered in a terminal in this folder. On Windows, you need to replace forward slashes with backslashes in paths.

All the files you'll create in this guide already exist in the `complete-application` subfolder, if you prefer to copy them.

### Run FusionAuth And {frontmatter.technology} Via Docker

You'll find a Docker Compose file `docker-compose.yml` and an environment variables configuration file `.env` in the root folder of the repository.

Assuming you have Docker installed, you can start FusionAuth on your machine with the following.

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

This will start five containers, one each for FusionAuth, Postgres, Elasticsearch, MariaDB, and {frontmatter.technology}. Wait for all five containers to start.

Here you are using a bootstrapping feature of FusionAuth, called [Kickstart](/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/kickstart). When FusionAuth starts for the first time, it will look at the `kickstart/kickstart.json` file and configure FusionAuth to your specified state.

<Aside type="note">
If you ever want to reset the FusionAuth system, delete the volumes created by `docker-compose` by executing `docker compose down -v`, then rerun `docker compose up -d`.
</Aside>

FusionAuth will be configured with these settings:

* Your client Id is `e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e`.
* Your client secret is `super-secret-secret-that-should-be-regenerated-for-production`.
* Your example username is `richard@example.com` and the password is `password`.
* Your admin username is `admin@example.com` and the password is `password`.
* The base URL of FusionAuth is `http://localhost:9011/`.

You can log in to the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin) and look around if you want to, but with Docker and Kickstart, everything will already be configured correctly.

<Aside type="caution">
  The `.env` and `kickstart.json` files contain passwords. In a real application, always add these files to your `.gitignore` file and never commit secrets to version control.
</Aside>

### The Basic {frontmatter.technology} Application

While this guide builds a new {frontmatter.technology} project, you can use the same method to integrate your existing project with FusionAuth.

The {frontmatter.technology} [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x#your-first-laravel-project) suggests many ways of creating a new project. This guide uses the standard [Bitnami Laravel Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/laravel), which creates the project for you. This image also contains a version of PHP, so you don't need to install PHP on your physical machine.  If you browse to [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001), you'll see the site is running.

<Aside type="note">
  It may take a few more minutes for the host to come up on http://localhost:5001 after you run the `docker compose up -d` command as the Laravel container updates dependencies and executes migrations.
</Aside>

All the starter app files are available for editing in the `your-application` folder and mapped to the {frontmatter.technology} Docker volume. Composer packages are already in the `vendor` folder, so you don't need to download them.

<Aside type="caution">
Normally, you should not commit your vendor folder to Git, but the Docker container won't start without all the Composer dependencies, so they are included in this guide.
</Aside>

If you are not familiar with Laravel, here's a brief explanation of its structure:

- `app` — contains the lowest level code: models, controllers, and middleware.
- `bootstrap` — the starting point for execution.
- `config` — contains all settings.
- `database` — contains all database migration scripts.
- `public` — contains static resources (images, css) available to anyone on the web.
- `resources` — similar to `public`, but contains Blade templates, and files are adapted by the server before serving.
- `routes` — contains the server code to respond to URLs called by a browser.
- `storage` — cache folder managed by Laravel when running.
- `tests` — where you write your tests.
- `vendor` — contains all Composer packages.

## Authentication

Authentication in {frontmatter.technology} is managed by [Socialite](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/socialite). For this application, you need the [FusionAuth Socialite provider](https://github.com/SocialiteProviders/FusionAuth). To install it, run the following command, which uses the PHP inside your Docker container.

```shell
docker compose exec lara_app composer require socialiteproviders/fusionauth
```

Edit `your-application/.env` and insert the following lines.

```
FUSIONAUTH_CLIENT_ID="E9FDB985-9173-4E01-9D73-AC2D60D1DC8E"
FUSIONAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET="super-secret-secret-that-should-be-regenerated-for-production"
FUSIONAUTH_BASE_URL="http://fusionauth:9011"
FUSIONAUTH_REDIRECT_URL="http://localhost:5001/auth/callback"
# FUSIONAUTH_TENANT_ID=
```

This tells {frontmatter.technology} where to find and connect to FusionAuth.

In this file, also overwrite the values for the following keys as described here.

```
DB_HOST=mariadb
DB_USERNAME=bn_myapp
DB_DATABASE=bitnami_myapp
```

This enables {frontmatter.technology} to connect to the database running in the adjacent Docker container.

<Aside type="note">
  Note that {frontmatter.technology} will silently overwrite the `DB_HOST` value with `mariadb` in the file `InteractsWithDockerComposeServices.php`, so you can't change this value or the database service name in Docker. If you encounter database connection errors in your own apps running in Docker, check that this file isn't interfering with your connection strings.
</Aside>

In the file `your-application/config/services.php`, add one more item to the array being returned with the code below.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/laravel/config/services.php"}
  lang="php"
  tags="fusionauth" />

Now the configuration files have all the settings you need. Next, you'll change your provider to be aware of FusionAuth.

In the file `your-application/app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php`, replace the `$listen` array with the code below.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/laravel/app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php"}
  lang="php"
  tags="fusionauth" />

Finally, update your User model to have FusionAuth fields.

In the file `your-application/app/Models/User.php`, add the FusionAuth items to the `$fillable` and `$hidden` properties with the code below.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/laravel/app/Models/User.php"}
  lang="php"
  tags="fusionauth" />

Every model in {frontmatter.technology} uses the database, so you need to update the database table to match your new model.

Create a file named `your-application/database/migrations/2023_09_27_142009_add_fusionauth_fields_user_table.php` or run the command below to create it.

<Aside type="note">
  Running the command below will create the file with a slightly different name depending on the date you are running the command.
</Aside>

```shell
docker compose exec lara_app php artisan make:migration add_fusionauth_fields_user_table
```

The result is the same whether you create the database scripts manually or with this command, so you can use your preferred method.

Add the code below to the file.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/laravel/database/migrations/2023_09_27_142009_add_fusionauth_fields_user_table.php"}
  lang="php" />

Run the command below to update your MariaDB database with the new User definition.

```shell
docker compose exec lara_app php artisan migrate
```

## Customization

Now that authentication is done, the last task is to create example pages that a user can access only when logged in.

### CSS And HTML

Copy over some CSS and an image from the example app.

```shell
cp ./complete-application/laravel/public/changebank.css ./your-application/public/changebank.css
cp ./complete-application/laravel/public/money.jpg ./your-application/public/money.jpg
```

Next, create an `index.blade.php` file.

```shell
touch your-application/resources/views/index.blade.php
```

Paste the following code into the file.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/laravel/resources/views/index.blade.php"}
  lang="php" />

The index page contains nothing to note except a link to the login page `<a href="/login">`.

Next, create an `account.blade.php` file.

```shell
touch your-application/resources/views/account.blade.php
```

Paste the following code into the file.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/laravel/resources/views/account.blade.php"}
  lang="php" />

The account page displays the user's email from FusionAuth, as you'll see later when you create the route `<p class="header-email">{{$email}}</p>`.

Next, create a `change.blade.php` file.

```shell
touch your-application/resources/views/change.blade.php
```

Paste the following code into the file.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/laravel/resources/views/change.blade.php"}
  lang="php" />

The change page uses some Blade conditional statements to display different divs depending on the state returned by the form POST `@if ($state['error'] && $state['hasChange'])`.

The change page also includes a `@csrf` anti-forgery token in the form at the bottom to prevent {frontmatter.technology} throwing page expired errors.

### Route

In the file `your-application/routes/web.php`, overwrite everything with the code below.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/laravel/routes/web.php"}
  lang="php" />

The homepage route `/` checks whether you are logged in and redirects you to your account page if you are.

The login route replaces the Docker service name `fusionauth` with `localhost` in `$url = str_replace('fusionauth', 'localhost', $url);`. The former is used in the {frontmatter.technology} service to access FusionAuth, while the latter needs to be displayed in your browser URL bar, which doesn't know about Docker since it's on your physical machine. In future apps, if you aren't running in Docker, you can use the first commented line instead of this replacement.

After login, FusionAuth redirects you to the `/auth/callback` route. Use Socialite to update the user model in the database with `$user = User::updateOrCreate([`, then start a session for the user with `Auth::login($user);`.

Logout ends the session with `Auth::logout();`.

The account and change routes both include the user's email in the page template data, `return view('account', ['email' => Auth::user()->email]);`. Both routes use middleware to prevent users without a session from seeing the page, `})->middleware('auth');`.

Finally, the change route has both a GET and a POST version. Both versions return the same view, but the POST route does a calculation and includes more template data.

## Run The Application

Browse to [the app](http://localhost:5001). Log in using `richard@example.com` and `password`. The change page will allow you to enter a number. Log out and verify that you can't browse to the [account page](http://localhost:5001/account).

## Next Steps

This quickstart is a great way to get a proof of concept up and running quickly, but to run your application in production, there are some things you're going to want to do.

### FusionAuth Customization

FusionAuth gives you the ability to customize just about everything to do with the user's experience and the integration of your application. This includes:

* [Hosted pages](/docs/v1/tech/themes/) such as login, registration, email verification, and many more.
* [Email templates](/docs/v1/tech/email-templates/email-templates).
* [User data and custom claims in access token JWTs](/articles/tokens/jwt-components-explained).

### Security

* You may want to customize the [token expiration times and policies](/docs/v1/tech/oauth/#configure-application-oauth-settings) in FusionAuth.
* Choose [password rules](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/tenants#password) and a [hashing algorithm](/docs/v1/tech/reference/password-hashes) that meet your security needs.

### Tenant And Application Management

* Model your application topology using [Applications](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/applications), [Roles](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/roles), [Groups](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/groups), [Entities](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/groups), and more.
* Set up [MFA](/docs/v1/tech/guides/multi-factor-authentication), [Social login](/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers/), or [SAML](/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers/samlv2/) integrations.
* Integrate with external systems using [Webhooks](/docs/v1/tech/events-webhooks/), [SCIM](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/scim), and [Lambdas](/docs/v1/tech/lambdas/).

### {frontmatter.technology} Authentication

- [Laravel Socialite concepts](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/socialite)

## Troubleshooting

- I get "This site can’t be reached localhost refused to connect" when I click the Login button.

Ensure FusionAuth is running in the Docker container. You should be able to log in as the admin user `admin@example.com` with a password of `password` at [http://localhost:9011/admin](http://localhost:9011/admin).

- Docker complains that the container `lara_app` is already running.

Run the following command to stop and remove all existing Docker containers then start them again.

```shell
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rm lara_db
docker rm lara_app
```

- {frontmatter.technology} says there is an invalid state exception.

Browse to the homepage, log out, and try to log in again. If that still doesn't work, delete and restart all the containers.

- It still doesn't work.

You can always pull down a complete running application and compare what's different.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-php-laravel-web.git
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rm lara_db
docker rm lara_app
cd fusionauth-quickstart-php-laravel-web/complete-application
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec lara_app composer install
docker compose exec lara_app php artisan migrate
```
