## Prerequisites

For this Quickstart, you'll need:

* [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php) 8.1
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com), version 20 or later, which is the quickest way to start FusionAuth. (There are [other ways](/docs/get-started/download-and-install)).

## General Architecture

<LoginArchitectureWeb />

## Getting Started

Start with getting FusionAuth up and running and creating a new {frontmatter.technology} application.

### Clone The Code

First, grab the code from the repository and change into that folder.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-php-laravel-web.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-php-laravel-web
```

All shell commands in this guide can be entered in a terminal in this folder. On Windows, you need to replace forward slashes with backslashes in paths.

All the files you'll create in this guide already exist in the `complete-application` subfolder, if you prefer to copy them.

### Run FusionAuth Via Docker

<DockerSpinup kickstartUri={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"} />

### The Basic {frontmatter.technology} Application

While this guide builds a new {frontmatter.technology} project, you can use the same method to integrate your existing project with FusionAuth.

To create a new {frontmatter.technology} project run the following command. There are other ways of creating the project as suggested in the {frontmatter.technology} [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x#your-first-laravel-project).

```shell
composer create-project laravel/laravel your-application && cd your-application
```

Composer will initialize the project and add all the starter app files in `your-application` directory.

If you are not familiar with Laravel, here's a brief explanation of its structure:

- `app` — contains the lowest level code: models, controllers, and middleware.
- `bootstrap` — the starting point for execution.
- `config` — contains all settings.
- `database` — contains all database migration scripts.
- `public` — contains static resources (images, CSS) available to anyone on the web.
- `resources` — similar to `public`, but contains Blade templates, and files are adapted by the server before serving.
- `routes` — contains the server code to respond to URLs called by a browser.
- `storage` — cache folder managed by Laravel when running.
- `tests` — where you write your tests.
- `vendor` — contains all Composer packages.

## Authentication

Authentication in {frontmatter.technology} is managed by [Socialite](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/socialite). For this application, you need the [FusionAuth Socialite provider](https://github.com/SocialiteProviders/FusionAuth). To install it, run the following command.

```shell
composer require socialiteproviders/fusionauth
```

In `your-application/.env`, insert the following lines.

```
FUSIONAUTH_CLIENT_ID="E9FDB985-9173-4E01-9D73-AC2D60D1DC8E"
FUSIONAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET="super-secret-secret-that-should-be-regenerated-for-production"
FUSIONAUTH_BASE_URL="http://localhost:9011"
FUSIONAUTH_REDIRECT_URL="http://localhost:8000/auth/callback"
# FUSIONAUTH_TENANT_ID=
```

This tells {frontmatter.technology} where to find and connect to FusionAuth.

This quickstart will use a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database. SQLite is a small, fast, self-contained database engine, but you can use MySQL or Postgres if you have them installed on your machine.

Create a SQLite database by running the following command from `your-application` directory.

```shell
touch database/database.sqlite
```

In the `your-application/.env` file, comment out the values for the following keys as shown here.

```
# DB_CONNECTION=mysql
# DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
# DB_PORT=3306
# DB_DATABASE=laravel
# DB_USERNAME=root
# DB_PASSWORD=
```

Add the following key above the keys you just commented out.

```
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
```

This enables {frontmatter.technology} to connect to the SQLite database.

In the file `your-application/config/services.php`, add one more item to the array being returned with the code below.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/config/services.php"}
  lang="php"
  tags="fusionauth" />

Now the configuration files have all the settings you need. Next, you'll change your provider to be aware of FusionAuth.

In the file `your-application/app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php`, replace the `$listen` array with the code below.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php"}
  lang="php"
  tags="fusionauth" />

Finally, update your User model to have FusionAuth fields.

In the file `your-application/app/Models/User.php`, add the FusionAuth items to the `$fillable` and `$hidden` properties with the code below.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/app/Models/User.php"}
  lang="php"
  tags="fusionauth" />

Every model in {frontmatter.technology} uses the database, so you need to update the database table to match your new model.

Create a file named `your-application/database/migrations/2023_11_03_112258_add_fusionauth_fields_user_table.php` or run the command below to create it.

<Aside type="note">
  Running the command below will create the file with a slightly different name depending on the date you are running the command.
</Aside>

```shell
php artisan make:migration add_fusionauth_fields_user_table
```

The result is the same whether you create the database scripts manually or with this command, so you can use your preferred method.

Add the code below to the file.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/database/migrations/2023_11_03_112258_add_fusionauth_fields_user_table.php"}
  lang="php" />

Install the following package required to allow manipulation of columns.

```shell
composer require doctrine/dbal
```

Run the command below to update your database with the new User definition.

```shell
php artisan migrate
```

## Customization

Now that authentication is done, the last task is to create example pages that a user can access only when logged in.

### CSS And HTML

Copy over some CSS and images from the example app.

```shell
cp ../complete-application/public/changebank.css public/changebank.css
cp ../complete-application/public/money.jpg public/money.jpg
cp ../complete-application/public/changebank.svg public/changebank.svg
```

Next, create an `index.blade.php` file.

```shell
touch resources/views/index.blade.php
```

Paste the following code into the file.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/resources/views/index.blade.php"}
  lang="php" />

The index page contains nothing to note except a link to the login page `<a href="/login">`.

Next, create an `account.blade.php` file.

```shell
touch resources/views/account.blade.php
```

Paste the following code into the file.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/resources/views/account.blade.php"}
  lang="php" />

The account page displays the user's email from FusionAuth, as you'll see later when you create the route `<p class="header-email">{{$email}}</p>`.

Next, create a `change.blade.php` file.

```shell
touch resources/views/change.blade.php
```

Paste the following code into the file.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/resources/views/change.blade.php"}
  lang="php" />

The change page uses some Blade conditional statements to display different `div`s depending on the state returned by the form POST `@if ($state['error'] && $state['hasChange'])`.

The change page also includes a `@csrf` anti-forgery token in the form at the bottom to prevent {frontmatter.technology} throwing page expired errors.

### Route

In the file `your-application/routes/web.php`, overwrite everything with the code below.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/routes/web.php"}
  lang="php" />

The homepage route `/` checks whether you are logged in and redirects you to your account page if you are.

After login, FusionAuth redirects you to the `/auth/callback` route. Use Socialite to update the user model in the database with `$user = User::updateOrCreate([`, then start a session for the user with `Auth::login($user);`.

Logout ends the session with `Auth::logout();`.

The account and change routes both include the user's email in the page template data, `return view('account', ['email' => Auth::user()->email]);`. Both routes use middleware to prevent users without a session from seeing the page, `})->middleware('auth');`.

Finally, the change route has both a GET and a POST version. Both versions return the same view, but the POST route does a calculation and includes more template data.

## Run The Application

From the `your-application` directory, run the following command.

```shell
php artisan serve
```

Browse to [the app](http://localhost:8000) at http://localhost:8000. Log in using `richard@example.com` and `password`. The change page will allow you to enter a number. Log out and verify that you can't browse to the [account page](http://localhost:8000/account).

## Next Steps

<NextSteps />

### {frontmatter.technology} Authentication

- [Laravel Socialite concepts](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/socialite)

## Troubleshooting

- I get "This site can’t be reached localhost refused to connect" when I click the Login button.

Ensure FusionAuth is running in the Docker container. You should be able to log in as the admin user `admin@example.com` with a password of `password` at [http://localhost:9011/admin](http://localhost:9011/admin).


- {frontmatter.technology} says there is an invalid state exception.

Browse to the homepage, log out, and try to log in again. If that still doesn't work, delete and restart all the containers.

- It still doesn't work.

You can always pull down a complete running application and compare what's different.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-php-laravel-web.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-php-laravel-web
docker compose up -d
cd complete-application
composer install
touch database/database.sqlite
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve
```

Browse to the app at http://localhost:8000.
