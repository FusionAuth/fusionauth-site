In this quickstart, you will build an application with {frontmatter.technology} and integrate it with FusionAuth. The application is for [ChangeBank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkH-kD73QUM), a global leader in converting dollars into coins. It will have areas reserved for logged in users and public-facing sections.

Find the Docker Compose file and source code for the complete application at {frontmatter.url}.

## Prerequisites

For this Quickstart, you'll need:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com), version 20 or later, which is the quickest way to start FusionAuth. (There are [other ways](/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/)).

## General Architecture

While this sample application doesn't have login functionality without FusionAuth, a more typical integration will replace an existing login system with FusionAuth.

In that case, the system might look like this before FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginBefore alt={"Request flow during login before FusionAuth"}/>

The login flow will look like this after FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginAfter alt={"Request flow during login after FusionAuth"}/>

In general, you would introduce FusionAuth to normalize and consolidate user data, making it consistent and up-to-date and offloading your login security and functionality to FusionAuth.

## Getting Started

Start with getting FusionAuth up and running and creating a new {frontmatter.technology} application.

### Clone The Code

First, grab the code from the repository and change into that folder.

```
git clone https://github.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-php-laravel-web
cd fusionauth-quickstart-php-laravel-web
```

All shell commands in this guide can be entered in a terminal in this folder. On Windows, you need to replace forward slashes with backslashes in paths.

All the files you'll create in this guide already exist in the `complete-application` subfolder, if you prefer to copy them.

### Run FusionAuth and {frontmatter.technology} Via Docker

You'll find a Docker Compose file `docker-compose.yml` and an environment variables configuration file `.env` in the root folder of the repository.

Assuming you have Docker installed on your machine, you can start FusionAuth on your machine with the following.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start five containers, one each for FusionAuth, Postgres, Elasticsearch, MariaDB, and Laravel.

Here you are using a bootstrapping feature of FusionAuth, called [Kickstart](/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/kickstart). When FusionAuth starts for the first time, it will look at the `kickstart/kickstart.json` file and configure FusionAuth to your specified state.

<Aside type="note">
If you ever want to reset the FusionAuth system, delete the volumes created by `docker-compose` by executing `docker-compose down -v`, then rerun `docker-compose up -d`.
</Aside>

FusionAuth will be configured with these settings:

* Your client Id is `e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e`.
* Your client secret is `super-secret-secret-that-should-be-regenerated-for-production`.
* Your example username is `richard@example.com` and the password is `password`.
* Your admin username is `admin@example.com` and the password is `password`.
* The base URL of FusionAuth is `http://localhost:9011/`.

You can log in to the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin) and look around if you want to, but with Docker and Kickstart, everything will already be configured correctly.

<Aside type="caution">
  The `.env` and `kickstart.json` files contain passwords. In a real application, always add these files to your `.gitignore` file and never commit secrets to version control.
</Aside>

### The Basic {frontmatter.technology} Application

While this guide builds a new {frontmatter.technology} project, you can use the same method to integrate your existing project with FusionAuth.

The {frontmatter.technology} [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x#your-first-laravel-project) suggests many ways of creating a new project. In this guide, you've used the standard [Bitnami Laravel Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/laravel), which has created the project for you. If you browse to `http://localhost:3000`, you'll see the site is running.

All the files are available in the `your-application` folder for editing. Composer packages are already in the `vendor` folder — you don't need to download them. Normally you should not commit your vendor folder to git, but the Docker container won't start without all its Composer dependencies, so they have been included in this guide.

## Authentication

Authentication in Laravel is managed by [Socialite](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/socialite). For this application, you need the [FusionAuth provider](https://github.com/SocialiteProviders/FusionAuth). To install it, run the following command, which uses the PHP inside your Docker container.

```bash
docker compose exec lara_app      composer require socialiteproviders/fusionauth
```

Edit `your-application/.env` and insert the following lines.

```env
FUSIONAUTH_CLIENT_ID="E9FDB985-9173-4E01-9D73-AC2D60D1DC8E"
FUSIONAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET="super-secret-secret-that-should-be-regenerated-for-production"
FUSIONAUTH_BASE_URL="http://fusionauth:9011"
FUSIONAUTH_REDIRECT_URL="http://localhost:3000/auth/callback"
# FUSIONAUTH_TENANT_ID=
```

In this file, also overwrite the following database fields.

```env
DB_HOST=mariadb
DB_USERNAME=bn_myapp
DB_DATABASE=bitnami_myapp
```

Note that Laravel will overwrite the `DB_HOST` value with `mariadb`, in the file `InteractsWithDockerComposeServices.php`, so you can't change this value, or the database container name, in Docker. If you encounter database connection errors in your own app, check that this file isn't interfering with your connection strings.

In the file `your-application/app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php`, replace the `$listen` array with the code below.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/laravel/app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php"}
  lang="php"
  tags="fusionauth" />

In the file `your-application/config/services.php`, add one more item to the array being returned with the code below.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/laravel/config/services.php"}
  lang="php"
  tags="fusionauth" />

In the file `your-application/app/Models/User.php`, add the FusionAuth items to the `$fillable` and `$hidden` properties with the code below.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/app/Models/User.php"}
  lang="php"
  tags="fusionauth" />

Create a file named `your-application/database/migrations/2023_09_27_142009_add_fusionauth_fields_user_table.php`, or run the command below to create it.

```bash
docker compose exec lara_app        php artisan make:migration add_fusionauth_fields_user_table
```

There is no difference in result if you create the database scripts manually, or with this command. Choose the method you prefer.

Now add the code below to the file.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.coderoot + "your-application/database/migrations/2023_09_27_142009_add_fusionauth_fields_user_table.php"}
  lang="php" />

Run the command below to update your MariaDB database with the new User definition.

```bash
docker compose exec lara_app         php artisan migrate;
```

## Customization

Now that authentication is done, the last task is to create example pages that a user can access only when logged in.

Copy over some CSS and an image from the example app.

```bash
cp ./complete-application/laravel/public/changebank.css ./your-application/public/changebank.css
cp ./complete-application/laravel/public/money.jpg ./your-application/public/money.jpg
```

Create three pages from the complete-application.

```bash
cp ./complete-application/laravel/resources/views/index.blade.php ./your-application/resources/views/index.blade.php
cp ./complete-application/laravel/resources/views/account.blade.php ./your-application/resources/views/account.blade.php
cp ./complete-application/laravel/resources/views/change.blade.php ./your-application/resources/views/change.blade.php
```


In the file `your-application/routes/web.php`, overwrite everything with the code below.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.coderoot + "/complete-application/laravel/routes/web.php"}
  lang="php" />



Change the index page `mysite/views/index.ejs` with the following code.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-express-web/main/complete-application/views/index.ejs"
 lang="typescript" />

This page allows the user to log in by offering a link to the route you created in the previous section, `<a href="/login">`.

Next, add the `account.ejs` view.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-express-web/main/complete-application/views/account.ejs"
 lang="typescript" />

 You can see that email returned from FusionAuth is shown in the line `<%= email %>`.

 Finally, add the `change.ejs` view.

 <RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-express-web/main/complete-application/views/change.ejs"
 lang="typescript" />

This page has a form at the bottom that allows the user to call the POST version of the page when clicked. The server route calculates the change and renders it using the `state` variable. Depending on the result, different sections of the page are shown, by conditional code like `<% if (state.error && state.hasChange) { %>`

## Run The Application

Start the {frontmatter.technology} server.

```shell
npm run start
```

You can now browse to [the app](http://localhost:3000).

Log in using `richard@example.com` and `password`. The change page will allow you to enter a number. Log out and verify that you can't browse to the [account page](http://localhost:3000/account).

## Next Steps

This quickstart is a great way to get a proof of concept up and running quickly, but to run your application in production, there are some things you're going to want to do.

### FusionAuth Customization

FusionAuth gives you the ability to customize just about everything to do with the user's experience and the integration of your application. This includes:
* [Hosted pages](/docs/v1/tech/themes/) such as login, registration, email verification, and many more.
* [Email templates](/docs/v1/tech/email-templates/email-templates).
* [User data and custom claims in access token JWTs](/articles/tokens/jwt-components-explained).

### Security

* You may want to customize the [token expiration times and policies](/docs/v1/tech/oauth/#configure-application-oauth-settings) in FusionAuth.
* Choose [password rules](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/tenants#password) and a [hashing algorithm](/docs/v1/tech/reference/password-hashes) that meet your security needs.

### Tenant And Application Management

* Model your application topology using [Applications](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/applications), [Roles](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/roles), [Groups](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/groups), [Entities](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/groups), and more.
* Set up [MFA](/docs/v1/tech/guides/multi-factor-authentication), [Social login](/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers/), or [SAML](/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers/samlv2/) integrations.
* Integrate with external systems using [Webhooks](/docs/v1/tech/events-webhooks/), [SCIM](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/scim), and [Lambdas](/docs/v1/tech/lambdas/).

## Troubleshooting

### "This site can’t be reached localhost refused to connect" When I Click The Login Button
Ensure FusionAuth is running in the Docker container. You should be able to log in as the admin user `admin@example.com` with a password of `password` at [http://localhost:9011/admin](http://localhost:9011/admin).

### Docker Complains That The Container `lara_app` Is Already Running
Run the following command to stop and remove all existing Docker containers.

```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q) && docker rm $(docker ps -a -q);
```

### Laravel Says There Is An Invalid State Exception
Browse back to the homepage. Log out. Try log in again. If that still doesn't work, delete and restart all the containers.

### It Still Doesn't Work.
You can always pull down a complete running application and compare what's different.

```
git clone https://github.com/ritza-co/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-express-web.git
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q) && docker rm $(docker ps -a -q);
cd fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-express-web
docker-compose up -d
cd complete-application
npm install
npm run start
```
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q) && docker rm $(docker ps -a -q);
docker compose exec lara_app      composer install
