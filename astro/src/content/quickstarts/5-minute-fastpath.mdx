You've chosen to install FusionAuth via Fast Path, using a local database (PostgreSQL or MySQL). 

This is the best option if you have a local database already set up or you want to test FusionAuth with an external database.

If you've arrived here directly, start with the [5-Minute Setup Guide Overview](/docs/v1/tech/5-minute-setup-guide/).

## Overview

Here are steps to take to set up FusionAuth and configure it to provide login and logout functionality for your application.

Steps similar to these will be used for integrating with any identity provider. Let's get into the details of each step. 

## 1. Install FusionAuth

You are following the FastPath installation guide, so you'll use the FastPath method to install FusionAuth.

<FastPathInstall />

Once the Fast Path installer completes, you will see the below output.

```sh title="Fast Path Install Complete"

######################################################################## 100.0%

Install is complete. Time for tacos.

 1. To start FusionAuth run the following command
    /Users/bpontarelli/dev/example/fusionauth/bin/startup.sh

 2. To begin, access FusionAuth by opening a browser to http://localhost:9011

 3. If you're looking for documentation, open your browser and navigate to https://fusionauth.io/docs

Thank you have a nice day.

## 2. Start FusionAuth

The next step is to start FusionAuth using the command that the Fast Path installer created. This script is called `startup.sh` or `startup.ps1`. You can execute it from the installation directory.

```shell title="MacOS and Linux Startup Script"
fusionauth/bin/startup.sh
```

If you are on Windows, you'll need to use the `startup.ps1`. Prior to version `1.40.0` the file will be named `startup.bat` instead.

```shell title="Windows Startup Script"
.\fusionauth\bin\startup.ps1
```

This script will start both the `fusionauth-app` component as well as the `fusionauth-search` component if you downloaded the Elasticsearch option. (Here's [a document on how to choose whether to do so](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/users#user-search).) 

## 3. Complete Maintenance Mode 

After you have FusionAuth installed and running, open your browser to `http://localhost:9011`. This is the default address for FusionAuth when running locally. This will bring up the FusionAuth admin UI, which should be sitting in Maintenance Mode and ready to be configured. 

FusionAuth enters Maintenance Mode any time the database is not accessible or is not properly set up. In this case, FusionAuth was able to connect, but the system was not configured. Below is a screenshot of the Maintenance Mode screen.

Here you need to provide the super user credentials for the database along with the database hostname, if it isn't running locally. You can also select either MySQL or PostgreSQL and change the database port if needed. For this example, you will be using PostgreSQL on the standard port with a super username of `postgres` and a password of `password`. You can also change the username and password that will be created as the primary database account that FusionAuth will access. This is the `fusionauth` user above, but can be set to any username and password you desire.

The reason that FusionAuth uses a separate username and password to connect to the database during normal operation is that if the configuration is compromised and an attacker learns the database username and password, they will only have access to the FusionAuth database. This is helpful if you are using a single database server for multiple applications and databases. This is known as the principle of least privilege and FusionAuth generally follows this principle.

Once you click the **Submit** button, you will be taken to the next step of Maintenance Mode. If you have opted to install with Elasticsearch, this step is where the FusionAuth Search component is configured, otherwise you can skip ahead to step 4, the Setup Wizard.

Our Fast Path install and startup script automatically start the `fusionauth-search` component, which is a standard version of Elasticsearch. Since FusionAuth is able to connect to this search engine, all that is needed is to create the indexes inside it. This page looks like this.

<img src="/img/docs/quickstarts/maintenance-mode-search.png" alt="Maintenance Mode Search" width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

Clicking the **Submit** button here will cause FusionAuth to exit Maintenance Mode and begin starting up. You see an interstitial page.
