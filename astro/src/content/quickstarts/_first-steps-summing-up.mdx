To verify that your system is set up, navigate to http://localhost:9011 and be sure you can see the FusionAuth UI.  

You're done with step 1... congratulations!  You've got your own FusionAuth server running in docker.
Your system has been set up using a Kickstart to pre-populate the tutorial environment with an application and some users. 
Feel free to explore what's available before moving on to configuring your application's security using FusionAuth.

Next is step 2, where you can view a tutorial about configuring FusionAuth using the web UI, or interact directly with FusionAuth's APIs from the command line.
