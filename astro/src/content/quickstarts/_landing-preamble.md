Learn how you would use FusionAuth to add authentication and authorization to an application in the framework or language of your choice in 15 minutes or less.

Each quickstart includes a complete runnable application and a shell application you can build out by following the step-by-step integration instructions. Application examples include: [traditional web applications](#web-application), [single-page applications](#spa), [mobile applications](#mobile-app), and [APIs protected with access tokens](#api).

These quickstarts help you rapidly evaluate FusionAuth and see how an integration works, rather than serve as a blueprint for integrating FusionAuth into your current system. For that, see the [Getting Started](/docs/get-started/) documentation.

You'll need the following to work through any quickstarts.

- Git, for cloning the example repository
- Docker, to run FusionAuth and its dependencies
- An editor, to update files
- The language, platform or framework; for example, Xcode to run the iOS quickstart or Java for the Spring example
