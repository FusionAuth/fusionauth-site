In the last few days, I have taken a look back at what the FusionAuth team shipped in 2024, and I wanted to share some of the highlights.

{/* more */}

## Highlights

While many features were added and bugs squashed, I wanted to hit the highlights. Since FusionAuth is versioned software, most highlights correspond to product releases, but not all of them.

### January - March

Throughout the quarter, we released a lot of documentation, including:

* [a rust quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-rust-actix-web)
* [three migration guides](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/provider-specific/)
* [multiple articles about security and identity](/articles/)
* [a guide on using GitHub actions with FusionAuth](/docs/get-started/run-in-the-cloud/github-actions) and [a corresponding GitHub action](https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-github-action)
* [a guide on limiting the number of devices a user can log in on](/docs/extend/examples/device-limiting)

In March, we released a bugfix and security focused product release, with nearly 30 bugfixes and improvements. We all love features, but bugfixes are important too.

### April - June

In April, [we added in-app first time help](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/setup-wizard#complete-first-time-setup), to let assist folks new to FusionAuth with getting set up correctly.

We also added [support for OAuth scopes](/blog/custom-scopes-in-third-party-applications), which allows you to use FusionAuth as a foundation for an app ecosystem. Create custom scopes, associate them with applications, and allow your users to consent to sharing their data held by you. Anyone who has public APIs can use FusionAuth to share their APIs and user data with partners and outside developers, becoming a platform.

Finally, we added the ability to [customize the UserInfo response using a lambda](/docs/extend/code/lambdas/userinfo-populate). The UserInfo endpoint is part of the OIDC spec. It takes an access token and returns information about a user. The UserInfo response overlaps with the ID token claims, but with this lambda, you can now control and modify both of these spec-compliant sources of data about your users.

In May, we introduced [simple themes](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/simple-theme-editor). Our fully customizable look and feel is unique to FusionAuth, but thirty-plus templates full of FreeMarker can be daunting when starting out. Simple themes offers the ability to quickly build a custom look and feel to explore if FusionAuth meets your needs.

Perhaps more importantly, it offers easier forward compatibility. When you customize FusionAuth using advanced themes, you are responsible for propogating changes when a new version of FusionAuth lands. With simple themes, the FusionAuth team owns that responsibility.

### July - Sep

Q3 saw passkeys enter our community plan in August. Now anyone using FusionAuth can enable passkeys for their users.

In Septmber, [the webhook event log](/docs/extend/events-and-webhooks/webhook-event-log) landed. This feature was a long time coming, but lets you view review events sent by FusionAuth. It also includes timing and result information for each attempt. Since our webhooks are heavily used when integrating FusionAuth into other systems, having more visiblity into how they are behaving is helpful for troubleshooting and analysis.

The [login validation lambda](/docs/extend/code/lambdas/login-validation) was delivered in September as well. Like other lambdas, this lambda gives you fine grained control over part of the login process. This particular lambda lets you control whether or not a user's login succeeds. You can look at the user, the registration, the authentication type, and an identity provider. Because of all this context, this lambda allows you to offer fine grained control over whether a login succeeds.

Want to allow a user to log in on the third day of the month between 7pm and 10pm, but only if it is a Tuesday and they use Facebook to log in? It it were me, I'd double check with your product manager about the requirements, but with this lambda you can do it.

This lambda lets you add custom, localizable error messages, so when that user can't log in because it isn't Tuesday the 3rd, you can offer them an explanation. When combined with [Lambda HTTP Connect](/docs/extend/code/lambdas/lambda-remote-api-calls), you can reuse existing API logic as well. Maybe you want to add ['must be a waxing moon phase'](https://docs.astronomyapi.com/endpoints/studio/moon-phase) to the above requirements?

We also added docs over the quarter, including:

* [how to use FusionAuth with CloudFlare's API gateway](/docs/extend/examples/api-gateways/cloudflare-api-gateway)
* monitoring with [Amazon CloudWatch](/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/cloudwatch), [DataDog](/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/datadog), [Splunk](/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/splunk), and [ElasticSearch](/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/elastic)
* [one migration guide](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/provider-specific/)
* [extendeding the guide on SMTP configuration](/docs/customize/email-and-messages/configure-email) to support nine providers
* [a guide on session management](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/logout-session-management)
* a blog post about [deploying to Render](/blog/fusionauth-on-render)
* [a blog post about Hacktoberfest 2024](/blog/2024-hacktoberfest)

In August, we also released a new version of [our website](/), with a new design, an overhaul of our messaging, and a new information architecture.

### Oct - Dec

We released an express free trial in Nov, allowing folks to kick the tires on FusionAuth for a month without having to enter any credit card details. We get it, some devs don't want to install Docker to check out new software.

We also upgraded our cloud infrastructure, and these changes were generally released in Q4. This improves the FusionAuth Cloud performance and flexibility. But of course, you can always self-host and run the exact same code.

While this upgrade is largely invisible to our customers, as it should be, there were two enhancements worth calling out:

* everyone gets at least one custom domain, no matter which type of hosting you purchase
* our webhooks, Lambda HTTP Connect calls, messengers and connectors are coming from a set IP range, making firewall configuration easier if you have a firewall between FusionAuth Cloud and systems your deployment needs to communicate with

In December, we announced [AuthCon](/blog/authcon-press-release), the first Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) conference, with speakers from ARM, IDPro, GitLab, Alteryx and GitHub, among others. Learn more, submit a talk or register at [the AuthCon website](https://www.authcon.io/).

We also shipped more docs, including:

* [5k words on how building self-hostable software differs from SaaS](/blog/building-self-hostable-application)
* [technical use case documentation](/docs/get-started/use-cases/)
* [a case study with Vatix](/blog/vatix-fusionauth)

## Non-Functional Improvements

Developers know that you can't just ship features. You also need to improve non-functional requirements like security, performance and operations related tasks. Over 2024, we delivered performance improvements around application areas including:

* database access
* user bulk import
* user and entity search, allowing you to avoid requesting unneeded data

We also improved the security features, including:

* better default API key security
* upstream proxy trust
* new confirmation page to improve security and interoperability with corporate link checkers

Finally, software has to be operated. Some improvements in that area include:

* added a health check API for better kubernetes compatibility
* upgraded FusionAuth to use the latest Java LTS, Java 21

All the details are in the [release notes](/docs/release-notes/)
