You may think of an authentication server as always online. After all, web and mobile apps using an auth server are usually served over the internet.

But sometimes, sometimes you just want to keep all your data off the internet. Your applications can run in a network that is disconnected from it. This practice is known as air-gapping. In this blog post you'll learn what air-gapping is, why you might want to do this, how an authentication server figures in, and how you can use FusionAuth in an air-gapped scenario.

## What Is Air-gapping?

Air-gapping as a security practice where software systems are physically isolated from unsecured networks. As mentioned above, this includes the internet. This creates a completely disconnected environment for sensitive operations and data.

There's also a version of air-gapping where your software systems are logically isolated from unsecured networks. You can accomplish this using firewalls or software defined networking that prohibits traffic entering or leaving your network.

Finally, though far less typical, you can be air-gapped due to location and cost, such as on an cruise ship. This is atypical and won't be addressed below, but is included for completeness.

Air-gapping can be achieved in an on-premises data center, local servers, in a private cloud, or even in a public cloud.

## Why Would You Air-Gap Your System

There are a few reasons you might air-gap your software system.

Regulatory and compliance requirements drive many organizations to implement air-gapped systems. This is particularly true if you are responsible for systems in highly regulated industries like these:

* defense
* healthcare
* finance

Government agencies handling classified information also must comply with strict security frameworks that mandate physical network isolation to prevent data from being stolen. Similarly, financial institutions dealing with critical trading systems or customer financial data often air-gap these environments to meet regulatory standards like PCI DSS or SOX. Healthcare organizations in the USA may isolate systems containing protected health information (PHI) to ensure HIPAA compliance. Other countries may have their own compliance frameworks which require air-gapping's heightened levels of security.

If you have high-value assets, protecting them may motivate you to implement air-gapped systems containing sensitive intellectual property, trade secrets, or strategic data. Research and development environments, apps using proprietary algorithms, customer databases, and other business critical assets can be isolated to prevent corporate espionage or data theft. Even if these systems don't face regulatory requirements such as those listed above, you want to avoid possible business impacts of a breach such as

* competitive disadvantage
* reputation damage
* financial losses

Another reason to consider building a system which can be air-gapped is if you are writing software to be bought and deployed into any of the above environments and want to delegate to another source of user credential and profile data. You can learn more about this scenario in the Identity Broker use case](/docs/get-started/use-cases/identity-broker).

## How To Use An Auth Server In An Air-gapped System

Even though applications in air-gapped environments are disconnected from any outside networks, they can typically still be accessed over a normal network using standard protocols like TCP/IP, DNS and HTTP. You still have similar problems as with web apps which run on the internet. You still need to:

* provision users and otherwise manage them
* authenticate users and services
* ensure proper access using RBAC or other systems
* allow single sign-on between 

Auth servers are designed to solve these problems.

Just like a database, an auth server can be a component for applications running in an air-gapped environment. Any such components should be fully functional without network connectivity. If they have any dependencies on outside networks, such as downloading datasets, those should be clearly delineated or not affect functionality you need.

If you do include an auth server in your air-gapped application running on an internal network supporting standard protocols, integrate with it in the same manner you'd do if your application was on the internet. For example, if the auth server and application support the Authorization Code grant, set up redirects and handle the token exchange.

## Using Air-gapped FusionAuth 

FusionAuth, being [downloadable, self-hostable software](/blog/building-self-hostable-application), can be self-hosted. Per the [license](/license), air-gapped deployments require FusionAuth's [Enterprise plan](/pricing). The Enterprise plan offers the necessary features and support for disconnected environments, including offline license validation.

After discussing your needs with [our sales team](/contact), you'll get a license key and text that can be added to your FusionAuth instances. Just as with a normal license, you'll have production and non-production keys. The latter allow development, staging, and QA instances to access the same features as production.

You can learn more about air-gapping FusionAuth in [the documentation](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/air-gapping).

### Validating JWTs Without Auth Server Network Connectivity

You can even have have multiple disjoint network segments, where FusionAuth is on one and an API needing to validate an access token is on another. To validate the tokens were properly signed by FusionAuth without network connectivity, do the following:

* Generate many public/private keypairs in FusionAuth, perhaps 100 or 1000. You want to use [the API](/docs/apis/keys#generate-a-key) or [an SDK](/docs/sdks) to do this.
* Bundle the public keypairs into the API during the normal deployment process. The easiest way to do that is probably to download the jwks.json file from FusionAuth.
* When an access token is presented, look up the corresponding public key from the keypairs, and [validate it](/articles/tokens/building-a-secure-jwt#consuming-a-jwt), including the signature.

When you want to rotate the keys, just change the key that FusionAuth is using to sign the access tokens. Keep track of how many keys you have rotated through. If you run out of key pairs, you'll need to redeploy the API with a new bundle of public keys.

Of course, in this scenario, the client making the API request has to get the access token *somehow* and may be on both networks.


## Implementation Best Practices

When rolling out an auth server as part of your air-gapped application environment, you need to consider network segmentation, monitoring, and update procedures.

### Network Setup

Network segmentation and access controls are the foundation of your secure air-gapped environment. Depending on your needs, you may implement multiple layers of network isolation using VLANs, firewalls, and possibly physical separation to create distinct security zones within your air-gapped environment. 

The auth server should reside in its own network segment with strictly controlled access points, allowing only necessary communication from application servers and admin accounts.

Deploy jump boxes or bastion hosts for administrative access, ensuring that direct connections to each server are limited and logged.

Network access control lists (ACLs) or other network management software should follow the principle of least privilege. Limit specific ports and protocols required. For the auth server and clients in particular, limit the ports to those needed for OIDC communication, typically TLS.

You should also implement network monitoring tools to detect unusual traffic patterns or unauthorized connection attempts within the isolated environment. Doing so offers early warning of potential security incidents or bugs.

## Monitoring 

Monitoring require planning when traditional cloud-based security tools aren't available. 

You should plan to capture [FusionAuth application logs](/docs/operate/monitor/monitor), system logs, and network traffic data to SIEM systems in the air-gapped environment. Regularly review logs and set up automated alerting for suspicious activities such as failed authentication attempts, privilege escalations, or configuration changes.

Basically, do what you should do in any environment, but with the twin caveats:

* you can't use normal cloud based services
* elevated awareness to preserve the critical data or functionality in the environment

## Update Procedures 

For updates, create a formal change management process. You'll want to:

* [stay informed about new releases](/docs/operate/roadmap/releases#release-notifications)
* [reviewing the features](/docs/release-notes)
* and, if it makes sense, [download and new versions](/direct-download) on an internet-connected system

You can then performing security scans and file validation (check the sha256 checksums) on test networks that are isolated.

After you are comfortable with the new release transfer it using secure media transfer protocols. 

You should maintain an isolated staging environment that mirrors your production setup to test updates before deployment.

Document your update procedures, including rollback plans, and ensure that critical security patches can be expedited through your approval process when necessary.

Regular vulnerability assessments should be conducted using offline scanning tools, and configuration changes should be versioned and applied automatically to avoid configuration drift over time.

## Summing Up

Air-gapped environments offer a more secure place to host applications. These applications usually use standard protocols and have user authentication, authorization and management needs.

You can use FusionAuth as an air-gapped auth server and easily add all these features to your air-gapped applications.
