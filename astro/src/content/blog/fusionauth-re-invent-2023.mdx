AWS re:Invent is one of the largest technical conferences in the world. In the cloud space, it is the go-to event. This week there will be tens of thousands of attendees in Las Vegas, Nevada. The [FusionAuth team will be among them](/aws-reinvent23), and we'd love to see you there!

Embark on a quest to track down the enigmatic [Alex Patterson](https://twitter.com/codercatdev), the ingenious Developer Relations Engineer at FusionAuth. Rumor has it he's been pushing the boundaries of innovation so relentlessly that he's practically cloned himself into two distinct versions! Brace yourself for the mind-bending journey and witness the extraordinary in the video below! Oh yeah he might even throw a cat sticker at you just to grab your attention, so watch out.

## Why the team is attending

We're going to re:Invent for many reasons.

One is that FusionAuth and our clients often deploy on the AWS public cloud. Some clients use vanilla EC2 instances with RDS, others deploy on solutions like EKS and Fargate (yes, [FusionAuth supports Kubernetes](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/kubernetes/fusionauth-deployment)).

AWS re:Invent is an opportunity to meet developers where they are, both during talks and in the ever-present hallway track. We look forward to exchanging knowledge and ideas with folks building on the AWS platform.

We're also excited to chat with attendees about authentication. We like to hear from developers about what they are building on top of solutions like FusionAuth, Auth0 and Cognito.

In the past, developers have asked us how to [migrate from Auth0](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/bulk/auth0) to FusionAuth and of course we are happy to help. Migrating away from Cognito isn't as straightforward, but [there are ways](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/bulk/cognito).

We're also looking forward to some AWS re:Invent sessions. 

Exciting ones include:
- SEC209 | Modernize authorization: Lessons from cryptography and authentication
- DAT333 | Building highly resilient applications with Amazon DynamoDB
- SEC322 | Integrate apps with Amazon Cognito and Amazon Verified Permissions
- BOA209 | Build verifiable and effective application authorization in 40 minutes

Of course, it isn't all education. There's also fun to be had!

There are also numerous parties. If you are attending AWS, chances are at least one vendor has emailed you with an invite. This Twitter account, [@reInventParties](https://twitter.com/reInventParties/), is a great way to discover additional opportunities for fun. 
Speaking of events our [Afterparty for Rockstars](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/afterparty-for-rockstars-tickets-749371669837), will let you party like a rockstar, where the music is loud, the drinks are flowing, and the energy is off the charts!

Finally, if nature is your thing, we've heard [Red Rock Canyon](https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/nevada/red-rock-canyon) has good hiking and climbing.

## Person On The Street

Have you ever wanted to be one of those people in Vegas that they walk up to and ask questions to win prizes? Well, you are in luck because from the moment my shoes hit the ground at re:Invent this year I will be recording all the action. I will be asking some hard-to-answer questions about Authentication, but when you get the answer right you will win swag at our booth [#152](https://meetings.hubspot.com/mvan-oppen/fusionauth-).
