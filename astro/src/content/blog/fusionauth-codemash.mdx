CodeMash is a tech stack agnostic technical conference and has been around since 2014. This year there will be hundreds of attendees in Sandusky, OH, learning about topics ranging from creating Alexa skills to mob programming to accessibility to testing. All the fun happens next week, starting Tuesday, January 11.

The FusionAuth team will be among them, and we'd love to see you.

## Why the team is attending

We're going to CodeMash because we love to connect with developers. FusionAuth is built devs, for devs, and we always want to learn what people are working on and excited about. We enjoy chatting with conference attendees and learn something from every conversation.

We're also looking forward to the sessions as well. A selection of interesting sessions include "Enterprise Observability with OpenTelemetry", "Tribal Knowledge in Agile Teams" and "ChatOps and DevOps: How to Use Comms as Incident Response". If you are interested, you can see the [entire session list here](https://www.codemash.org/session-list/).

There are also some longer "Pre-Compiler" workshops on Tuesday and Wednesday. These are four hour, or more, hands-on sessions where attendees will be building something; learn more about [prerequisites for these workshops here](https://prereqs.codemash.org/). 

Of course, it isn't all education. There's also fun to be had! This includes a [Capture the Flag secure coding challenge](https://www.codemash.org/announcing-the-codemash-2022-ctf-capture-the-flag-competition/). There's also the more typical social events, such as a welcome reception on Wednesday night to kick off the conference and a party Thursday night with karaoke and games. This is all in addition to the hallway track, always one of the best parts of an in-person conference.

It's worth mentioning that the conference organizers are well aware of current Covid-19 concerns and they have been updating [their policies and procedures](https://www.codemash.org/covid/) regularly.

## Meet up with FusionAuth

If you want to meet up with the FusionAuth team at CodeMash, we're around and ready to chat. 

You can find us in a couple of places:

* We are sponsoring the conference and have a booth. The booth will be set up Thursday and Friday. Come say hi for a demo, to chat about the intricacies of the Authorization Code grant, or to sign up for giveaways. Both an Oculus Quest and Millennium Falcon LEGO set will be raffled off.
* Team member Dan Moore is giving two talks on Thursday: ["Protecting your API with OAuth"](https://www.codemash.org/session-details/?id=282464) and a sponsored session [`create table user` Considered Harmful: Reasons You Should Outsource Your Auth](https://www.codemash.org/session-details/?id=307201). He'd love to see you.
* Finally, we'll be out and about as well. Send us a note via our [contact form](/contact/) or tweet/DM [Dan](https://twitter.com/mooreds) if you'd like to chat.

Happy CodeMashing!
