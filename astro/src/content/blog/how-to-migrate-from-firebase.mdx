Firebase is a serverless offering from Google which includes customer identity and access management (CIAM) as well as other typical functionality needed for an application. As such, it offers authentication and authorization, a database, metrics and more.

At FusionAuth, we talk to potential customers who are interested in migrating away from Firebase because of limitations, typically of standards or data control.

## Weaknesses of Firebase

**Replace existing list with:**

While Firebase offers serverless convenience and ease of setup, organizations often encounter limitations as they scale:

- **Single deployment model:** Firebase's SaaS-only approach prevents on-premises or private cloud deployments required for data sovereignty and compliance.
- **Geographic restrictions:** Firebase availability is limited to specific regions, potentially impacting global applications and data locality requirements.
- **OAuth limitations:** Missing support for device grants and other advanced OAuth flows can restrict application architecture and user experience options.
- **Usage throttling:** Firebase's rate limits may impact high-volume applications, while FusionAuth provides unlimited authentication requests.
- **Testing challenges:** Firebase's serverless model can complicate local development and testing workflows compared to FusionAuth's flexible deployment options.
- **Limited observability:** Troubleshooting and logging capabilities are constrained compared to self-hosted solutions like FusionAuth.

These limitations may be acceptable initially, but eventually you may need a feature not provided by Firebase, such as a unique login provider or the OAuth device grant.
Or perhaps you want more control over the location of your data, or a more typical testing and deployment setup.

For whatever reason, you may decide you need to move your customer and user data from Firebase. Let's take a look at how you might do so.

## When you shouldn't migrate

Firebase has strengths as well as weaknesses, and if your application depends on unique features or the upsides outweigh the downsides, continue to run on Firebase.

For example, if the customization is acceptable and you are using lots of Firebase features, migration doesn't make sense. The fact that Firebase is serverless makes it easy to "set and forget" and allows you to focus on other aspects of your application. You know, the features your users want.

If you need Firebase's messaging, analytics or the Cloud Firestore NoSQL database and are not willing to look at alternatives, migration also won't make sense. A standalone auth provider won't provide the breadth of functionality, and you may not want to piece together replacements for everything Firebase offers.

## How to migrate

If, however, you have decided to migrate from Firebase, the first decision you'll need to make is: "With what will I replace the other Firebase functionality I depend on?"

One option is to leave parts of your application running on Firebase.

Another is to migrate it all to an environment where you have more control. What makes sense here depends on what other Firebase functionality you use.

Such guidance is beyond the scope of this article, though there is plenty of discussion on the internet. Here's an [article about moving from Firebase to AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/startups/migrating-your-startup-from-firebase-to-aws/) and here's a [GitHub issue thread discussing alternatives](https://github.com/WelcometoMyGarden/welcometomygarden/issues/106).

<Aside nodark="true" type="note">
This blog post gives general guidance on migration off of Firebase to any other auth provider. If you are looking for step by step instructions on how to migrate from Firebase to FusionAuth, please review our [Firebase migration guide](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/bulk/firebase).
</Aside>

One of the critical pieces of any application infrastructure is, of course, authentication and authorization. This post will therefore focus on how to move your users' data. In this scenario, decide if you want to migrate your users in a bulk or drip migration.

## Bulk migration from Firebase

The basic steps of a bulk migration are:

* Set up the new auth system. Make sure you map user functionality and data from Firebase to the new system. Ensure the new system supports the [modified scrypt hashing algorithm](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/admin/java/reference/com/google/firebase/auth/hash/Scrypt) used by Firebase.
* Export your user data from Firebase. You can do this with the Firebase CLI: `firebase auth:export users.json --format=JSON --project your_project_id`.
* Massage the exported user data into a format acceptable to your new provider, using whatever data transformation tools you are comfortable with.
* Upload the user data to the new provider.
* Create configuration in the new auth system corresponding to the applications previously set up in Firebase. You should also customize the user interface, messages, MFA methods and any other specific relevant settings.
* Update your custom, COTS or OSS applications to point to the new auth system.
* Disable the sign-in methods in your Firebase application to ensure that all of your users are authenticating against the new system.

Here's the login flow before the bulk migration:

<BulkBeforeDiagram alt="Bulk migration login request flow before the migration." />

Here's the login flow after the bulk migration, when Firebase no longer is involved in the login process:

<BulkAfterDiagram alt="Bulk migration login request flow after the migration." />

The benefits of a bulk migration include:

* You can move all your users at one time. Having a single source of truth for customer data is typically beneficial.
* You can test the process repeatedly before going live.
* You no longer have a dependency on Firebase for authentication; the transition is quick.

The downsides of a bulk import are:

* You'll have to build a script to retrieve the data from Firebase, modify it, and push it to the new system. Here's an example of such a [script for a FusionAuth import](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-import-scripts/tree/main/firebase).
* There may be some downtime in the migration process where users cannot log in.
* If the new system can't support the scrypt algorithm, you can still load the users, but you will have to reset their passwords. This can be disruptive to the user experience.

Since Firebase uses scrypt to rehash user passwords at login, if a user has been imported with a different hash and never logged in, [the `passwordHash` field will be empty](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/auth). In that case, set the user's password to a random string and force them to reset their password.

## A drip migration from Firebase

With a drip, or slow, migration, users log in to the new system, provide their username and password, which is then forwarded to Firebase. This connection must be secure and should be augmented with IP restrictions, custom headers or client certificates; you don't want anyone to be able to submit credentials and probe your list of users. If the credentials are correct, the user is logged in and their data is migrated. The new system can rehash and store the password along with other user data.

Here's a diagram of an initial user login during a slow migration:

<SlowMigrationDiagram alt="Slow migration initial login request flow." />

After the initial login, Firebase is no longer the system of record for that user. Any changes to this user, whether made by themselves, automated processes or customer service team members, will need to be made in the new system. In subsequent logins, Firebase is never consulted.

<SlowSubsequentDiagram alt="Slow migration subsequent login request flow." />

The basic steps of a slow migration are:

* Set up the new auth system. Make sure you map all user functionality and data from Firebase to the new system.
* Determine what constitutes "done" for this migration, since it is unlikely that every single user will log in and be migrated, no matter how long you run these two systems in parallel. You can see [more details on how to calculate that](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users#migration-timeline).
* Set up a way for the new system to present user credentials to Firebase during an authentication event. The exact method will depend on new system features, with FusionAuth you use [Connectors](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/connectors/). On the Firebase side, it can be done with an API call; see [this Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest/auth#section-sign-in-email-password) for more.
* Create configuration in the new auth system corresponding to the applications previously set up in Firebase. You should also customize the user interface, messages, MFA methods and any other settings that are relevant.
* Update your custom, COTS or OSS applications to point to the new auth system.
* Wait for your users to log in and be migrated, running reports periodically to determine if you've migrated enough users to shut down the slow migration.
* Decide what to do with unmigrated users. Options include abandoning them, a bulk migration, or contacting them to encourage them to log in.
* Disable the sign-in methods in your Firebase application to ensure that all of your users are authenticating against the new system.

Slow migrations have less impact on your users, but more impact on your systems and employees and take more time.

For instance, if a customer service representative needs to reset a password, they will have to determine if the user has been migrated to the new system or not before they can process the request.

## Conclusion

This overview of a Firebase migration covers considerations for migrating user data. No matter what the new target system is, you'll need to decide between a bulk or slow migration, as well take specific steps to move your data and settings. You'll also want to consider if and how to migrate any other functionality you use in Firebase.
