We're excited to share some major news from the FusionAuth team. It's the right time for evolution as FusionAuth continues to grow our developer-first CIAM platform faster than ever.

{/* more */}
 
With that in mind, we're thrilled that [Brian Bell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-bell-b54105/) has accepted the role as our new Chief Executive Officer, succeeding founder Brian Pontarelli. Brian Pontarelli has always been a developer first and foremost. So we're happy to say that he'll be staying with the company and transitioning to the role of Chief Technology Officer.

## Why Brian Bell and Why Now?

For Brian Bell, FusionAuth represents the perfect storm of market opportunity and product-market fit. He's spent over two decades building companies at the intersection of identity, security, and developer tools. Most recently as CEO of Split Software, he scaled a developer-focused platform through rapid growth and a successful exit to Harness. Before that, he helped build identity solutions at Ping Identity and scaled developer-centric products at Zuora.

What excites Brian most about FusionAuth? The same thing that excites our customers: we've built something that just works, scales beautifully, and doesn't get in developers' way.

> "This market is booming as companies race to deliver seamless, secure digital experiences across web, mobile, and AI-powered platforms. CIAM has become a critical component in handling complex identity needs in human-AI-machine ecosystems, making it essential for modern application architectures. FusionAuth is uniquely positioned to lead this next era – and the market momentum we're seeing is just the beginning."

For our founder Brian Pontarelli, this transition feels natural. After building FusionAuth from the ground up with a relentless focus on developer experience, he's ready to dive deeper into what he loves most: the technology itself.

"Building FusionAuth has been incredible," Brian reflects. "What I'm most proud of is how we've stayed true to our developer-first roots while growing faster than the competition with minimal outside capital. Brian Bell gets what we've built here – and he has the experience to take us to the next level while keeping the product and developers at the center of everything we do."

## Customer Success Stories: Scale That Speaks

Our customers continue to achieve remarkable results with FusionAuth. Here are just a few highlights from recent case studies:

### Bilt: Fintech-Grade Authentication

[Bilt](/blog/bilt-fusionauth) chose FusionAuth for their financial technology platform, requiring the highest levels of security and compliance for their rewards and payments ecosystem.

> "FusionAuth has been an excellent partner, delivers the necessary functionality and performance, and maintains active development cycles.” - Bilt CTO Kosta Krauth

### Betty Blocks: 10,000+ Applications at Scale

[Betty Blocks](/blog/betty-blocks-fusionauth), a leading low-code development platform, has scaled to **over 10,000 applications** using FusionAuth. Each application serves between 100 to 10,000 users, demonstrating our ability to handle massive scale while maintaining performance.

> "If you're a bigger company, you might have 10-20 applications using FusionAuth, but with us, it goes into the multiple thousands of applications running on a very small amount of FusionAuth servers. You can use it at a really big scale and continue to be performant as well." - Betty Blocks Co-Founder Chris Obdam

### WeRoad: From Homegrown to Professional Authentication

[WeRoad](/blog/weroad-fusionauth) replaced their homegrown authentication system with FusionAuth to support their rapid international expansion. The migration enabled them to focus on core business features while ensuring security across multiple markets.

> “We like the customization. Our designers created a custom theme with animated clouds in the background. It’s fully customizable because we were able to make a nice login form.” - WeRoad DevOps Lead Roberto Dedoro

### Powerful Medical: Enterprise-Grade Security for Healthcare

[Powerful Medical](/blog/powerful-medical) leveraged FusionAuth's enterprise features to meet strict healthcare compliance requirements while maintaining the flexibility needed for their medical software platform.

> “The combination of these requirements eliminated all the competition and only FusionAuth was left standing. Auth0 came in second, but it did not provide On-Premise deployability.” - Powerful Medical CTO Simon Rovder

The opportunity ahead of us is enormous and Brian Bell is the right person to take FusionAuth to the next phase of our growth."
