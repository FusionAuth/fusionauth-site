It seems like we see a new customer identification and authentication (CIAM) provider every few weeks. It makes sense! Every application needs user login, so it seems like a solid bet. After [Okta acquired Auth0](/blog/congrats-auth0-okta-acquisition) back in 2021, the market got a serious boost. From that point forward, it seemed like comparing Auth0 to the competition was par for the course.

We get a lot of people who come to FusionAuth who are either considering Auth0, or they're already on Auth0 and they're unhappy. What's important to us is that the larger developer community recognizes the need for secure registration, login, and user management. Data security is vital for every company. Hacks and breaches are more common than ever before, so secure identity should be top of mind for any developer.

The fact is, Auth0 and FusionAuth are similar in a lot of ways. We both have the basic features that you'd expect from any CIAM provider:

*   Authentication for web and mobile apps
*   Unlimited users and groups
*   OAuth token and API key management

We even share some more advanced features that make a difference in the usability and security of an identity platform. User login is only part of the story. That's why Auth0 and FusionAuth both provide:

*   Multi-factor authentication
*   Private cloud deployments
*   Full support for Authentication as a Service (AaaS)
*   User search and User management interfaces

As you can see, FusionAuth and Auth0 provide many essential elements of a customer identity management platform. But that's where the similarities end.

## How FusionAuth and Auth0 are Different

Now that we've discussed the similarities, let's look at what sets FusionAuth apart from Auth0 and the rest of the market.

### **Free for Unlimited Users**

One of the biggest differences between Auth0 and FusionAuth is cost. FusionAuth is free for unlimited users. No strings, gimmicks, or tricks. No cost increases when you hit a certain Monthly Active User threshold. Much like a database or a web server, secure authentication is so essential that developers should be able to implement it quickly and easily without cost concerns. And unlike the free options from other vendors, we don’t user-limit FusionAuth. You get a full unrestricted platform.

FusionAuth does offer advanced features and support for a price, but we have many users running their business self hosting the Community plan.

### **Single-Tenant Security**

We mentioned above that Auth0 and FusionAuth both have on-premise and cloud options. Our difference is both our local and cloud options deliver true data isolation as _single-tenant solutions_. This eliminates the possibility of data leakage between unrelated companies, whether accidentally or through hacker activity. For additional security, customers can implement a firewall at any layer, further protecting their data from unauthorized access. With the substantial increase in the number and sophistication of hacking, phishing and spoofing attacks, we felt it was the best choice.

Additionally, FusionAuth’s single-tenant architecture also allows for easier compliance with complex regulatory restrictions in many industries and countries. Germany’s Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, Australia’s Privacy Principles, Canada’s PIPEDA, and the European Union’s GDPR all place different restrictions on how a user’s personal data can be used and transmitted. FusionAuth provides the expanded control that companies require to comply with laws and regulations in their specific region. For more details on the benefits and pitfalls of single- and multi-tenant solutions [read this whitepaper](/articles/identity-basics/multi-tenancy-vs-single-tenant-idaas-solutions "Single- vs. Multi-Tenant Paper").

### On-Premises or Air-gapped Deployments

Auth0 used to offer on-premises hosting, but stopped around 2021\. It seems that there were too many challenges in maintaining parity between their cloud-hosted and self-hosted options. That's not the case with FusionAuth. In fact, self-hosting gives you even more options, like the choice to opt out of usage stats, and you can run FusionAuth on any gear you have sitting around. Got an old Mac Mini sitting in a closet? Put it to use as your FusionAuth host.

### **Localization**

Every company doing business through the internet today has a storefront open to customers from around the globe. While having a vast pool of potential customers is a benefit, many companies struggle to deliver their products and services to the wide range of languages they encounter. FusionAuth was designed to allow you to easily communicate with your customers in the language they prefer. You can create customized HTML and text email templates for the languages you support, and easily add additional options as your community grows.

### **Configurable Password Encryption**

Every application has different security requirements. Some need to be HIPAA compliant, while others can be less stringent. FusionAuth lets you pick the level of security you need, and adjust it as quickly as your needs or threats evolve. We also allow you to use different password schemas for different groups of users, making it possible to consolidate multiple identity management systems into one efficient platform. This can be a completely transparent process without any downtime or customer friction.

### **Reporting and Analytics**

User reports have been in every slide presentation and corporate board meeting since the first bit of software hit the internet. From day one we give you the most viewed reports like daily and monthly active users, logins and registrations without any additional configuration or setup.

### **Custom Feature Development**

Another difference between Auth0 and FusionAuth is our size and flexibility. Auth0 is a huge corporation with hundreds of employees and tens-of-millions in investor funding. They are beholden to an extensive range of investors and board influencers who are all chasing “the best product-market fit.” Smaller companies with unique or specific needs are often overlooked or ignored.

FusionAuth is dedicated to our customers. We have successfully provided our core solutions with unique customizations and one-on-one support for our clients. We have eliminated the overhead, complex approval pipelines, and corporate red-tape that cripples large firms so we can deliver exceptional solutions for clients like DataStax, StrategyCorp, Deutsche Bank and IBM.
