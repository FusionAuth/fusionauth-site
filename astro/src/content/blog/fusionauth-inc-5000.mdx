FusionAuth is proud to share that we’ve made the Inc. 5000 list in the first year we applied, ranking as the #1597 fastest-growing company in the U.S. and 213th among software companies. The Inc. 5000 list features some of the fastest-growing, private independent businesses in the US, and its rankings are calculated on the previous 3 years' revenue growth percentage.

## Sustained growth
A fact that most of you reading this probably don’t know is that FusionAuth is 100% bootstrapped. So far, we’ve taken no venture capital money or outside funding unlike many in our industry. 

Auth0 raised $300+ million before getting acquired by Okta. In turn, other auth providers have taken massive Seed, Series A, and Series B rounds just to try to reach where we are today: a product that delivers what it promises - Auth, Built for Devs, by Devs - and one that is [winning the customer identity](/blog/winning-customer-auth-market) market. 

Sustained growth is harder to maintain than temporary growth, and we couldn’t be more grateful to our team and customers for getting us to this point. Winning awards like a spot in the Inc. 5000 validates our approach to building on our own terms.

_Stay tuned, as we’ll share more about our bootstrapping story later this week – and it starts with curse words._ 

## What a year

We wouldn’t be here without the loads of developers who trust their authentication to FusionAuth. In fact, a lot of what we [release](/docs/release-notes/) are enhancements and improvements they’ve requested. So thank you to our customers and users who have supported us and continue to help us build the best damn auth platform in the market. 

In the past year alone we’ve: 

* Hit over 13 million downloads of our Docker package all-time. 
* Launched [Webauthn](/articles/authentication/webauthn-explained) passkey support, brand new [SDKs](/docs/sdks/) and [quickstarts](/docs/quickstarts/), launched in the [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-65uhkzzoaqnwa) and [DigitalOcean](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/fusionauth) marketplaces, and made huge UX improvements to our documentation and technical content (with more to come – really soon).
* Helped hundreds of scaling startups and established businesses migrate from other auth providers (homegrown, OSS and commercial) to FusionAuth where they can benefit from flexible deployment options, better support and transparent pricing. 
* Awarded as a 2023 [Colorado Company to Watch](/blog/fusionauth-colorado-company-to-watch), 2023 [Best Place to Work](/blog/best-places-to-work), and a [G2 High Performer](/blog/fusionauth-g2-high-performer) in multiple categories.
