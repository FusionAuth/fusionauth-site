Here at FusionAuth, we spend our days talking to engineering leaders who are building the next generation of digital products. They’re running modern, scalable architectures and, increasingly, they’re hitting a wall. That wall isn't Authentication—they have FusionAuth for that. The wall is **Authorization**.

We've heard you, and today, with the acquisition of Permify, we're tearing that wall down.

## Authorization is Not Isolated: It’s the Natural Next Step for Identity

For years, developers have been focused on **CIAM (Customer Identity and Access Management)** to answer the question: **Who are you?** FusionAuth has proudly led the way in delivering that answer, offering a **dedicated, high-performance, and locally deployable** identity platform that gives you total control.

But in modern software, **identity is not a complete solution without authorization.** Authorization is not a separate, isolated problem you solve with a third-party tool; it is a **natural and necessary extension** of our best-in-class identity provider, FusionAuth.

In our sales conversations over the last 18 months, the requirements for access control have gone from simple Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to highly complex, contextual demands. By unifying **AuthN (who you are)** and **AuthZ (what you can do)**, we are addressing a **wider surface area of need** for our customers.

## The Anecdote that Sealed the Deal

I recently spoke with the VP of Engineering at a rapidly growing FinTech platform. They had successfully implemented FusionAuth for registration and login, but their application requirements were evolving daily. They needed:

- “A regional manager can view customer accounts **only** in their assigned geographic territory.” (Attribute-Based Access Control - ABAC)
- “A user can edit a document **only** if they are an explicit member of the document’s sharing list **or** if they are an administrator of the parent organization.” (Relationship-Based Access Control - ReBAC)

They told me they were spending **more engineering cycles** building and maintaining their complex, homegrown permissions engine than they were on their core product features. Their homegrown system was becoming a scaling bottleneck—a point of friction that introduced performance risk and constant security audit worry.

This story is just one of many. We realized that our responsibility to the developer community had expanded. We needed to simplify the entire journey from **Identity to Fine-Grained Permissioning**. That's why we acquired Permify.

## The Better Together Story: Outsized Value and Industry Leadership

The combination of FusionAuth and Permify is not a simple bolt-on; it’s a strategic unification that delivers **outsized value** and positions us to **lead the industry forward** by solving the AuthN/AuthZ problem with a single, elegant solution:

| Feature               | FusionAuth Alone                                     | FusionAuth + Permify                                                         | Outsized Value for You                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Identity Core (AuthN) | World-class, deployable CIAM.                        | Same world-class CIAM.                                                       | Cohesion: Your identity data is now immediately leveraged to drive authorization decisions.                                              |
| Permissions (AuthZ)   | Basic Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).              | Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA), including ABAC and ReBAC.                  | Flexibility: Build complex B2B features like secure collaboration and delegation, natively and securely.                                 |
| Scalability           | Horizontally & vertically scalable identity service. | Authorization powered by a high-performance, Zanzibar-inspired architecture. | Performance: Get sub-10ms latency on permission checks, even with billions of users and resources.                                       |
| Control               | Full control over user data and deployment.          | Full control over your authorization logic and policies.                     | Unification: One platform for all your identity and permission controls, simplifying compliance and audits and accelerating development. |

For our customers, this integration means you can **accelerate your product roadmap** by offloading the security and complexity of permissions to a solution built specifically to handle it. You can finally stop worrying about the performance cost of permission checks and start building the nuanced, highly collaborative features your users are demanding.

## The Path Forward

We are laser-focused on integrating Permify’s technology seamlessly into the FusionAuth platform in the coming months. We are hiring two Permify team members as contractors and investing heavily to ensure the open-source community continues to thrive.

The next step in the evolution of CIAM is the **unified control of Identity and Authorization**. By combining FusionAuth’s best-in-class identity provider with Permify’s cutting-edge authorization engine, we are uniquely positioned to lead that charge and deliver the comprehensive, developer-first platform you need to scale securely.

Look for a formal announcement of the fully integrated offering and streamlined pricing model in January 2026. Until then, we encourage you to check out the power of Permify’s technology and see why we believe this is the most powerful combination in the identity space today.
