Every day, my team and I talk to engineering leaders building the next generation of digital products. Those applications are increasingly complex, multi-tenant, collaborative and AI-enhanced. They’re running modern, scalable architectures – and, increasingly, they’re hitting a wall. That wall isn't authentication. They have FusionAuth for that. **The wall is authorization.**

And with our [acquisition](/blog/fusionauth-permify-pr) of [Permify](https://permify.co/), we're tearing that wall down.

## Authorization is Not Isolated: It’s a Natural Extension of Identity

Let’s keep it simple:

**Authentication** answers who a user is.

**Authorization** determines what they can do.

Modern CIAM must do both. But historically, developers have been forced to bolt together separate systems – one for AuthN, another for AuthZ – creating fragmentation, duplication, latency and audit complexity.

In our sales conversations over the last 18 months, the requirements for access control have gone from simple Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to highly complex, contextual demands.

By unifying **AuthN (who you are)** and **AuthZ (what you can do)** into a single platform, FusionAuth expands the value we deliver while removing the complexity from your team.

## What We Heard from Customers: AuthZ is a Bottleneck Now

Our team recently spoke with the VP of Engineering at a rapidly growing FinTech platform. They had successfully implemented FusionAuth for registration and login. That part ran beautifully. But their application permissioning needs were evolving daily.

- ABAC **(Attribute-Based Access Control)**:  Regional managers can view customer accounts only in their assigned geographic territory.
- ReBAC **(Relationship-Based Access Control):** A user can edit a document only if they were explicitly a member of the document’s sharing list or were an administrator of the parent organization.

The homegrown system designed to manage complex permissioning was quickly becoming a bottleneck and source of extensive maintenance. Far from the internal team’s core competency, the custom tool was a scaling bottleneck, and a point of friction that introduced performance risk and audit liability.

“FusionAuth solved login,” they told us. “Permissions are what’s killing us.”

## Beyond FinTech: AuthZ Spans Industries

This story is just one of many. Across different industries, engineering teams are encountering similar complex authorization requirements that standard RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) or simple, local checks cannot handle. These are the conversations that made it clear our responsibility to the developer community has expanded:

### 1. The Healthcare Challenge (Contextual/ABAC)

**The Need:** "A nurse can only view a patient's medical history **after** the patient has checked into their exam room, and **only** if that nurse is assigned to the current shift."

**The Problem:** Simply checking the user's role ("Nurse") isn't enough. The system needs to check the **patient's status** (an attribute) and the **nurse's current context** (another attribute, like shift assignment). This level of contextual authorization is almost impossible to maintain within an AuthN system like an ID token.

### 2. The Multi-Tenant SaaS Challenge (ReBAC & Hierarchy)

**The Need:** "A user can create a new project, but only if their current organization's subscription tier allows for more than 10 active projects, and only within the specific 'folder' they have been granted **creator** access to."

**The Problem:** The permission is dependent on a **hierarchy** (User→Folder→Project) and an **attribute of the tenant** (Subscription Tier Limit). When dealing with thousands of tenants, building and querying this organizational and policy graph becomes the primary performance bottleneck.

### 3. The Collaboration Platform Challenge (Delegated/Policy)

**The Need:** "A customer administrator must be able to delegate the 'Billing' permission to a specific internal finance team member **without** granting them all other administrator rights."

**The Problem:** Simple RBAC forces permissions to be bundled into broad roles. Modern systems require **fine-grained permissions** where access is granted not just by a fixed role, but by a flexible policy (e.g., Allow user X to Action Y on Resource Z) that can be easily updated or delegated via an API.

We realized that developers don't just need to know who is logging in; they need a high-performance, auditable, and scalable way to determine what that person can do across every microservice and resource. We needed to simplify the entire journey from Identity to Fine-Grained Authorization. **That's why we acquired Permify.**

## Authorization Becomes Mission-Critical in the AI Era

AI agents move faster than humans and behave non-deterministically.  That means:

- They access more data
- They take more actions
- They operate at machine speed

Without fine-grained authorization as a control plane, AI systems can overstep quickly – exceed permissions, expose data, or perform unintended operations. Fine grained authorization (FGA) allows safe AI enabled workflows. FGA is important for human/CIAM authorization, but becomes even more important when you introduce non-deterministic behavior at software speed. Agentic behavior further underlines the critical nature of authorization in the era of AI.

## The Better Together Story: Outsized Value and Industry Leadership

The combination of FusionAuth and Permify is not a simple bolt-on. When the technologies are fully integrated the combined product is a strategic unification that delivers **outsized value** and positions FusionAuth to **lead the industry forward** by solving the AuthN/AuthZ problem with a single platform:
