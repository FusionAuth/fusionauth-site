## SOC2 - Inside the Matrix


FusionAuth has had our SOC2 Type 2 for a few years now. Yes, we took the red pill early and dove head first into what has mostly become a requirement in the industry.

We began our SOC2 journey in 2021 - right around the time when software vendors were starting to provide tools to help automate the necessary data collection. Being an engineering company, automation is one of our love languages, so we were excited to dig in and use these great tools.

We started out using Vanta, but they had a number of fundamental architecture issues that caused high levels of pain at the time. To be fair, they’ve since fixed a lot of these issues and are now worth a look. Specifically, they only allowed employees to come from Google G-Suite and it was challenging to control. Given this was at a time where service accounts were heavily used, and we manage multiple email domains, this approach caused major headaches. Due to the way they managed employees back then, it also made it challenging to manage other features of their platform.

From Vanta we switched over to A-LIGN’s ASCEND, but this only lasted a few months. In 2021 (and to be honest, we haven’t re-evaluated them to see if anything has changed), ASCEND was a glorified spreadsheet with no automation at all. It simply wasn’t the shiny SOC2 automation and management tool we needed.
