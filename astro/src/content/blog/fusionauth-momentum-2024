FusionAuth, the leading Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) solution provider, today announced record-breaking revenue growth, extensive product updates, and an expanding global footprint in 2024. The company’s achievements underscore the rising demand for authentication solutions that can be locally tested and deployed anywhere. Unlike CIAM limited to SaaS-only, FusionAuth’s success comes from a hybrid model built for diverse pipelines, helping engineering deliver features faster.

“2024 has been a transformational year for us,” said Brian Pontarelli, CEO of FusionAuth. “Authentication needs to work better for technical teams, especially in today’s test-ship-repeat reality. Solutions that are multi-tenant SaaS only let users down when it comes to local testing and development, and most importantly, security. That’s why we make auth more accessible and secure than ever, with a single-tenant, hybrid deployment model that is also feature-rich, flexible, and customizable.”

Just as the CIAM landscape has changed, so too have engineering practices been fundamentally altered. Containerization and microservices are now the status quo. Application engineers are now at the forefront of revenue generation and elevating the importance around authentication decisions. [Nearly half](https://www.gartner.com/peer-community/oneminuteinsights/omi-2024-software-engineering-priorities-challenges-top-mind-hfe) of all teams prioritize developer productivity, and more than half of all engineering teams face skills gaps and budget constraints. FusionAuth’s downloadable, developer-first approach provides the flexibility and control that modern engineering teams need to navigate this intersection of security, user experience, and development efficiency.

2024 saw FusionAuth’s biggest year of financial growth yet, more than doubling its revenue numbers from 2023 while signing four of its five largest customers to date. The team expects to more than double again in 2025, as the number of high-scale customers tripled in 2024. With a continued influx of engineering teams tired of the limits imposed by SaaS-only, legacy CIAM vendors, FusionAuth is well positioned to continue its exponential growth.

Market success is also supported by employee growth of nearly 80 percent year over year, with continued hiring as the new year begins. FusionAuth is expanding its developer, product, marketing, and sales teams with expected headcount to top 100 employees before the end of 2025.
