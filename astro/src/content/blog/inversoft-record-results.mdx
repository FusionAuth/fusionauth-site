Inversoft, Inc., the parent company of software products FusionAuth and CleanSpeak, reported record results for the year ending December 2021, posting 168% growth in annual recurring revenue (ARR) at year end across both product lines, with FusionAuth adding a record 314% growth alone. GAAP revenue rose 73% year-over-year, with the significant difference reflecting the rapid rise in sales during 2021 to be recognized in 2022. Results were driven by increased awareness, product leadership, and rising demand in core markets of gaming, fintech, SaaS providers, and software based consumer services.

FusionAuth is the leading independent Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) platform built specifically for software developers to integrate authentication into customer facing applications. CleanSpeak is the intelligent profanity filtering and moderation platform protecting millions of online gaming and consumer users from offensive and inappropriate content. 

“Our B2B software-as-a-service and self-hosted products serve some of the fastest-growing consumer and technology segments. Every application needs advanced authentication, but it’s not something most developers want to build,” said Don Bergal, Inversoft CEO. “As well, in today’s environment, any application with user-generated content needs a content filter and our mature, industry-leading CleanSpeak platform hits the spot with both sophisticated language analysis and rapid implementation”.  

In response to growth, privately held Inversoft continues to add team members in software engineering, support, architecture, sales, and marketing at its Denver location and for remote work across the country. 

In 2021, the company exceeded company goals across all categories including total customers added, recognized revenue, recurring revenue, and revenue per customer. Inversoft is privately held and profitable.
