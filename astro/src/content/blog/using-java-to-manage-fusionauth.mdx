In this tutorial, we’re going to illustrate how to use Java to accomplish various tasks with FusionAuth, programmatically. In order to speed up our development time, we’ll use the FusionAuth Java client library, which comes with already-built methods that we’ll use instead of building things from scratch. 

{/* more */}

FusionAuth allows developers to simplify authentication, authorization, and user management tasks in their applications. One of the greatest benefits of this innovative identity solution is that it can be integrated with any programming language, platform, or anything else.

So, if your preferred language is [Python](/blog/2019/10/01/implementing-fusionauth-python), [Node.js](/blog/2019/02/19/easy-integration-fusionauth-nodejs), [PHP](/blog/2020/03/26/how-to-integrate-fusionauth-with-php), or anything else, you can use FusionAuth to take your authentication capabilities to the next level.

## What we'll cover

* Setting up FusionAuth
* Setting up Maven dependency
* Creating an application
* Creating a user
* Retrieving a user’s profile details
* Logging in a user
* Changing a user’s password

* Java development environment
* A web browser

Ready? 

Let's get going...

## Setting up FusionAuth

FusionAuth can be deployed on nearly any platform. Depending on the platform you're using, you can get the installation instructions [from here](/download). 

Once FusionAuth is installed on your platform, you can follow this [simple 5-minute guide](/docs/quickstarts/5-minute-setup-guide) to set it up and ensure it's running properly. That guide uses Node for the integration, but you can skip that part if you prefer to use Java.

Then, go to the FusionAuth UI and [create an API key](/docs/apis/authentication). We’ll use this key to access the FusionAuth application programmatically. Make sure you scope it to only allow access to the application, user, and user/change-password APIs to follow the principle of least privilege.

After completing the FusionAuth setup, and grabbing the API key, we can move to the next step. 

Shall we?

## Setting up the Maven dependency

To set up the dependencies needed for this project, let's create a Maven utility project and add the FusionAuth Java client library to the pom.xml file. We'll use [version 1.15.4](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.fusionauth/fusionauth-java-client/1.15.4) of the FusionAuth Maven dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.fusionauth</groupId>
  <artifactId>fusionauth-java-client</artifactId>
  <version>1.15.4</version>
</dependency>
```

You can also download all the code from [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-java)--note that if you do that you'll need to update some of the ids.

## Setup

The API key and location of the FusionAuth server are stored in a properties file called [`application.properties`](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-java/blob/main/src/main/resources/application.properties). Many Java application environments provide secrets management, but for this tutorial, we'll just load the properties file into a class. Make sure you update your `application.properties` file with the correct values.

```java
package io.fusionauth.example;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.util.Properties;

public class ApplicationProperties {
  private static String apiKey;
  private static String fusionAuthURL;

  public static String getApiKey() {
    return apiKey;
  }

  public static String getFusionAuthURL() {
    return fusionAuthURL;
  }

  public static void setupProperties() {
    try (InputStream input = ApplicationProperties.class.getResourceAsStream("/application.properties")) {
      Properties prop = new Properties();

      // load a properties file
      prop.load(input);
      fusionAuthURL = prop.getProperty("fusionAuthURL");
      apiKey = prop.getProperty("apiKey");
    } catch (IOException ex) {
      ex.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}
```


## Creating an application 

In FusionAuth, an [application](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/applications) refers to a place where a user can log into. Before you begin integrating authentication capabilities with FusionAuth, you’ll need to create at least one application. 

For example, if you want to manage the activities of users accessing your Todo application, you can create an application in FusionAuth and use it to register users, manage users' roles, monitor users' activities, and more. 

So, we’ll start by using the FusionAuth Java client to create an application. As earlier mentioned, the Java library comes with already-built methods that allow for easy integration of the FusionAuth REST API in Java environments.

If you go to [this GitHub page](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-java-client/blob/main/src/main/java/io/fusionauth/client/FusionAuthClient.java), you can see the various methods alongside their definitions. For example, to create an application, we’ll use the `createApplication` method. If you check the method definition, you’ll find that it only requires two parameters: the ID of the application and the request object that contains all the information used for creating the application. 

That’s a simple way of consuming the FusionAuth REST API. Isn't it?


Here is the code for using the createApplication method to create an application in FusionAuth:

```java
package io.fusionauth.example;

import com.inversoft.error.Errors;
import com.inversoft.rest.ClientResponse;
import io.fusionauth.client.FusionAuthClient;
import io.fusionauth.domain.Application;
import io.fusionauth.domain.api.ApplicationRequest;
import io.fusionauth.domain.api.ApplicationResponse;

public class CreateApplication {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApplicationProperties.setupProperties();

    // Instantiate the client
    FusionAuthClient client = new FusionAuthClient(ApplicationProperties.getApiKey(),
        ApplicationProperties.getFusionAuthURL());

    // Instantiate the application with a name (using the FusionAuth builder pattern)
    Application app = new Application().with(a -> a.name = "Todo");

    // Creating the request object
    ApplicationRequest request = new ApplicationRequest(app, null);

    // Use the returned ClientResponse object
    ClientResponse<ApplicationResponse, Errors> response = client.createApplication(null, request);

    if (response.wasSuccessful()) {
      System.out.println("Application creation successful");
    } else {
      // Handle errors
      System.out.println(response.exception);
    }
  }
}
```

As you can see from the code above, when instantiating the FusionAuth client, we specified the API key and the web address that points to our running FusionAuth server. You will need to provide your own unique values for these parameters.

Then, we created an variable named `app` that is an instance of the `Application` class and set the name of the application. We then passed this object to the constructor of the `ApplicationRequest` class. 

Notice that the Java client returns a `ClientResponse` object that contains everything that happened while communicating with the FusionAuth server.

Also, we passed the value of the first parameter of the `createApplication` method as `null`. This will allow FusionAuth to generate a secure random UUID for the newly created application. 

Finally, we handle any errors experienced when creating the application on FusionAuth. 

If we run the above code, and go to the FusionAuth UI, we see that the todo application has been created successfully:

![The new application has been created..](/img/blogs/java-client-example/create-application.png)

Notice from the image above that the application’s ID has been created for us. We’ll use this ID in the subsequent sections of this tutorial. 

Also, if we run the code again, we get the following error, indicating that the application has already been created:

```json
{
  "fieldErrors" : {
	"application.name" : [ {
  	"code" : "[duplicate]application.name",
  	"message" : "An Application with name = [Todo] already exists."
	} ]
  },
  "generalErrors" : [ ]
}
```

## Creating a user

Applications are no good without users. In FusionAuth, a [user](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/users) refers to someone that has been granted the right to use your FusionAuth application -- such as an employee, client, or an end-user. So, let’s see how you can create a user and also carry out various user management tasks for the Todo app.

We’ll do what is called [Full Registration](/docs/apis/registrations#create-a-user-and-registration-combined). In this case, we’ll create a user and register them for the application we’d created previously. These two actions will take place simultaneously in a single transaction. If you'd rather not do that, you can create a user and then add them to an application -- the choice is yours. 

To do this, we’ll use the `register` method, which comes with the Java client library. This method requires two parameters: the `userId`, which should be supplied as a UUID string, and the `UserRegistration` request object.

Here is the code for creating a user:

```java
package io.fusionauth.example;

import java.util.UUID;
import com.inversoft.error.Errors;
import io.fusionauth.client.FusionAuthClient;
import io.fusionauth.domain.User;
import io.fusionauth.domain.UserRegistration;
import io.fusionauth.domain.api.user.RegistrationRequest;
import io.fusionauth.domain.api.user.RegistrationResponse;
import com.inversoft.rest.ClientResponse;

public class CreateUser {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApplicationProperties.setupProperties();

    // Instantiate the client
    FusionAuthClient client = new FusionAuthClient(ApplicationProperties.getApiKey(),
        ApplicationProperties.getFusionAuthURL());

    // Instantiate the user and provide login details
    User user = new User().with(u -> u.email = "fusionjava@example.com")
                          .with(u -> u.password = "mypassword101");

    // Instantiate the user registration and request object
    UserRegistration registration = new UserRegistration();
    registration.applicationId = UUID.fromString("1aae68ac-d4d3-4e96-b24c-c9478a309673");

    RegistrationRequest request = new RegistrationRequest(user, registration);

    // Use the returned ClientResponse object
    ClientResponse<RegistrationResponse, Errors> response = client.register(null, request);

    if (response.wasSuccessful()) {
      System.out.println("Registration successful");

    } else {
      // Handle errors
      System.out.println(response.errorResponse);
    }
  }
}
```

Notice that we specified the ID of the application we created earlier. This is one way to register the user to the application. 

Also, we did not specify the ID of the user. This lets FusionAuth to create one for us automatically. 

If we run the above code, and go to the FusionAuth UI, we see that the user has been created successfully:

![The new user has been created..](/img/blogs/java-client-example/user-created.png)

Notice from the image above that the user’s ID has been created for us. We’ll use this ID in the subsequent sections of this tutorial. Also, the user has been registered to the Todo application we created earlier. 

## Retrieving a user's profile details

Now, let’s see how to retrieve the profile details of the user we created previously. To do this, we’ll use the `retrieveUser` method. 

If you check the method definition, you’ll find that it only requires the `userId` parameter, which should be supplied as a `java.util.UUID`. We just need to provide the `userId` and we’ll get the specified user’s profile details. Here is the code for using the `retrieveUser` method to retrieve a user’s registered information:

```java
package io.fusionauth.example;

import java.util.UUID;
import com.inversoft.error.Errors;
import io.fusionauth.client.FusionAuthClient;
import io.fusionauth.domain.api.UserResponse;
import com.inversoft.rest.ClientResponse;

public class RetrieveUserInfo {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApplicationProperties.setupProperties();

    // Instantiate the client
    FusionAuthClient client = new FusionAuthClient(ApplicationProperties.getApiKey(),
        ApplicationProperties.getFusionAuthURL());

    UUID userId = UUID.fromString("5eb46e47-927c-41ac-ae60-ed88e3840edd");

    // Use the returned ClientResponse object
    ClientResponse<UserResponse, Errors> response = client.retrieveUser(userId);

    if (response.wasSuccessful()) {
      // Output the user's profile details
      System.out.println(response.successResponse.user);

    } else {
      // Handle errors
      System.out.println(response.errorResponse);
    }
  }
}
```

If you run the above code, here's the result you should see on the console:

```json
{
  "encryptionScheme" : null,
  "factor" : null,
  "id" : "812478d4-c99d-4e55-9606-9e58e83938d3",
  "password" : null,
  "passwordChangeRequired" : false,
  "passwordLastUpdateInstant" : 1587287741465,
  "salt" : null,
  "verified" : true,
  "preferredLanguages" : [ ],
  "memberships" : [ ],
  "registrations" : [ {
    "data" : { },
    "preferredLanguages" : [ ],
    "tokens" : { },
    "applicationId" : "3c219e58-ed0e-4b18-ad48-f4f92793ae32",
    "authenticationToken" : null,
    "cleanSpeakId" : null,
    "id" : "7c105c78-c49d-40c1-a5a1-fcff013fd4eb",
    "insertInstant" : 1587299377006,
    "lastLoginInstant" : null,
    "roles" : [ "admin" ],
    "timezone" : null,
    "username" : null,
    "usernameStatus" : "ACTIVE",
    "verified" : true
  } ],
  "active" : true,
  "birthDate" : null,
  "cleanSpeakId" : null,
  "data" : { },
  "email" : "fusionjava@gmail.com",
  "expiry" : null,
  "firstName" : null,
  "fullName" : null,
  "imageUrl" : null,
  "insertInstant" : 1587287741325,
  "lastLoginInstant" : null,
  "lastName" : null,
  "middleName" : null,
  "mobilePhone" : null,
  "parentEmail" : null,
  "tenantId" : "31626538-3731-3762-3664-303931343339",
  "timezone" : null,
  "twoFactorDelivery" : "None",
  "twoFactorEnabled" : false,
  "twoFactorSecret" : null,
  "username" : "fusionjava",
  "usernameStatus" : "ACTIVE"
}
```

This would be useful for displaying on their profile page in the Todo application, for example.

## Log in a user

Let’s say we want to use the FusionAuth Java client to log in the user we created. We'd do this if we wanted to log a user in from our own application, rather than using [FusionAuth's OAuth capabilities](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/) and the Authorization Code grant. You might do this if you were building a command line tool to add Todos or a mobile application.

We can do this by using the `login` method. This method allows us to log in a user programmatically using their stored credentials. We’ll also provide the ID of our Todo application. 

To log the user in, we’ll use the `LoginRequest` class. It’s this object which we’ll pass as an argument to the `login` method.  The `LoginRequest` class requires three string parameters: the ID of the application (as UUID), the user’s email/username, and their password. We’ll use the credentials we created earlier in this tutorial along with the ID of our Todo application. 

Here is the code:

```java
package io.fusionauth.example;

import java.util.UUID;
import com.inversoft.error.Errors;
import io.fusionauth.client.FusionAuthClient;
import io.fusionauth.domain.api.LoginRequest;
import io.fusionauth.domain.api.LoginResponse;
import com.inversoft.rest.ClientResponse;

public class UserLogin {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApplicationProperties.setupProperties();

    // Instantiate the client
    FusionAuthClient client = new FusionAuthClient(ApplicationProperties.getApiKey(),
        ApplicationProperties.getFusionAuthURL());

    UUID appId = UUID.fromString("1aae68ac-d4d3-4e96-b24c-c9478a309673");

    // Create the request object
    LoginRequest request = new LoginRequest(appId, "fusionjava@example.com", "mypassword101");

    // Use the returned ClientResponse object
    ClientResponse<LoginResponse, Errors> response = client.login(request);

    if (response.wasSuccessful()) {
      System.out.println("Login successful");

    } else {
      // Handle errors
      System.out.println(response.errorResponse);
    }
  }

}
```

## Changing a user's password

To change a user's password, we'll use the `changePasswordByIdentity` method. This method allows us to change a user's password using their identity -- login ID and current password. This means we can let our users change their password in our Todo application. Note that doing this will change their password across all FusionAuth applications running within [this tenant](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/tenants).

We'll use the `ChangePasswordRequest` class, which we'll pass as an argument to the `changePasswordByIdentity` method. `ChangePasswordRequest` requires three string parameters -- the login ID, the current password, and the new password. 

Here is the code:

```java
package io.fusionauth.example;

import com.inversoft.error.Errors;
import io.fusionauth.client.FusionAuthClient;
import io.fusionauth.domain.api.user.ChangePasswordRequest;

import com.inversoft.rest.ClientResponse;

public class ChangePassword {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApplicationProperties.setupProperties();

    // Instantiate the client
    FusionAuthClient client = new FusionAuthClient(ApplicationProperties.getApiKey(),
        ApplicationProperties.getFusionAuthURL());

    // Creating the request object
    ChangePasswordRequest request = new ChangePasswordRequest("fusionjava@gmail.com", "oldpassword", "newpassword");

    // Use the returned ClientResponse object
    ClientResponse<Void, Errors> response = client.changePasswordByIdentity(request);

    if (response.wasSuccessful()) {
      System.out.println("Password change successful");

    } else {
      // Handle errors
      System.out.println(response.errorResponse);
    }
  }
}
```

## Deactivating a user

To deactivate a user, we'll use the `deactivateUser` method. We'll provide the ID of the user we are deactivating to this method. Deactivation means they cannot log in, which might happen if the credit card they used to sign up for the Todo app was declined.

Here is the code:

```java
package io.fusionauth.example;

import java.util.UUID;
import com.inversoft.error.Errors;
import io.fusionauth.client.FusionAuthClient;
import com.inversoft.rest.ClientResponse;

public class DeactivateUser {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApplicationProperties.setupProperties();

    // Instantiate the client
    FusionAuthClient client = new FusionAuthClient(ApplicationProperties.getApiKey(),
        ApplicationProperties.getFusionAuthURL());

    UUID userId = UUID.fromString("5eb46e47-927c-41ac-ae60-ed88e3840edd");

    // Use the returned ClientResponse object
    ClientResponse<Void, Errors> response = client.deactivateUser(userId);

    if (response.wasSuccessful()) {
      System.out.println("User deactivated successfully");

    } else {
      // Handle errors
      System.out.println(response.errorResponse);
    }
  }
}
```

Here's how the user will look in the admin interface when they've been deactivated:

![The new user has been deactivated..](/img/blogs/java-client-example/user-deactivated.png)

## Reactivating a user

Next, to reactivate the user we just deactivated (perhaps they paid their bill and are now itching to add some todos), let's use the `reactivateUser` method and provide the ID of the user as its parameter.

Here is the code:

```java
package io.fusionauth.example;

import java.util.UUID;
import com.inversoft.error.Errors;
import io.fusionauth.client.FusionAuthClient;
import io.fusionauth.domain.api.UserResponse;

import com.inversoft.rest.ClientResponse;

public class ReactivateUser {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApplicationProperties.setupProperties();

    // Instantiate the client
    FusionAuthClient client = new FusionAuthClient(ApplicationProperties.getApiKey(),
        ApplicationProperties.getFusionAuthURL());

    UUID userId = UUID.fromString("5eb46e47-927c-41ac-ae60-ed88e3840edd");

    // Use the returned ClientResponse object
    ClientResponse<UserResponse, Errors> response = client.reactivateUser(userId);

    if (response.wasSuccessful()) {
      // Outputting the user's profile details
      System.out.println(response.successResponse.user);

    } else {
      // Handle errors
      System.out.println(response.errorResponse);
    }
  }
}
```

If you run the above code, and the request is successful, it'll reactivate the user and output their profile information on the console. 

## Deleting a user

Finally, let's see how to delete a user from the FusionAuth server. To do this, we'll use the `deleteUser` method and provide the ID of the user as its parameter. You might do this if a user cancels their Todo app membership.

Remember that this method *permanently* deletes all the user information from your application. So, use it cautiously. 

Here is the code:

```java
package io.fusionauth.example;

import java.util.UUID;
import com.inversoft.error.Errors;
import io.fusionauth.client.FusionAuthClient;
import com.inversoft.rest.ClientResponse;

public class DeleteUser {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApplicationProperties.setupProperties();

    // Instantiate the client
    FusionAuthClient client = new FusionAuthClient(ApplicationProperties.getApiKey(),
        ApplicationProperties.getFusionAuthURL());

    UUID userId = UUID.fromString("5eb46e47-927c-41ac-ae60-ed88e3840edd");

    // Use the returned ClientResponse object
    ClientResponse<Void, Errors> response = client.deleteUser(userId);

    if (response.wasSuccessful()) {
      System.out.println("Deleted!");

    } else {
      // Handle errors
      System.out.println(response.errorResponse);
    }
  }
}
```

If you run the above code, and the request is successful, you'll get a response of `Deleted!`, indicating that the user has been deleted from FusionAuth.

## Deactivating an application

To deactivate an application, we'll use the `deactivateApplication` method and provide the ID of the application as its parameter. This disables the application but does not delete all the data. You might do this if you need to disable logins for all users due for system maintenance.

Here is the code:

```java
package io.fusionauth.example;

import java.util.UUID;
import io.fusionauth.client.FusionAuthClient;
import com.inversoft.error.Errors;
import com.inversoft.rest.ClientResponse;

public class DeactivateApplication {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApplicationProperties.setupProperties();

    // Instantiate the client
    FusionAuthClient client = new FusionAuthClient(ApplicationProperties.getApiKey(),
        ApplicationProperties.getFusionAuthURL());

    UUID appId = UUID.fromString("991001b4-d196-4204-b483-a0ed5dbf7666");

    // Use the returned ClientResponse object
    ClientResponse<Void, Errors> response = client.deactivateApplication(appId);

    if (response.wasSuccessful()) {
      System.out.println("Application deactivated successfully");

    } else {
      // Handle errors
      System.out.println(response.errorResponse);
    }
  }
}
```

## Reactivating an application

To reactivate the application we just deactivated, because the system maintenance is done, let's use the `reactivateApplication` method and provide the ID of the application as its parameter. 

Here is the code:

```java
package io.fusionauth.example;

import java.util.UUID;
import io.fusionauth.client.FusionAuthClient;
import io.fusionauth.domain.api.ApplicationResponse;

import com.inversoft.error.Errors;
import com.inversoft.rest.ClientResponse;

public class ReactivateApplication {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApplicationProperties.setupProperties();

    // Instantiate the client
    FusionAuthClient client = new FusionAuthClient(ApplicationProperties.getApiKey(),
        ApplicationProperties.getFusionAuthURL());

    UUID appId = UUID.fromString("991001b4-d196-4204-b483-a0ed5dbf7666");

    // Use the returned ClientResponse object
    ClientResponse<ApplicationResponse, Errors> response = client.reactivateApplication(appId);

    if (response.wasSuccessful()) {
      // Output the application's details
      System.out.println(response.successResponse.application);

    } else {
      // Handle errors
      System.out.println(response.errorResponse);
    }
  }
}
```

If you run the above code, and the request is successful, it'll reactivate the application. You'll also get the bonus of printing out the application's details on the console. 

## Deleting an application

Lastly, let's see how to delete an application from FusionAuth. To do this, we'll use the `deleteApplication` method and provide the ID of the application as its parameter. 

Remember, this method permanently deletes the application from FusionAuth. So, you need to use it cautiously. Most of the time the better choice is to deactivate the application. But maybe you are no longer in the Todo app business and want to remove it from your servers.

Here is the code:

```java
package io.fusionauth.example;

import java.util.UUID;
import io.fusionauth.client.FusionAuthClient;

import com.inversoft.error.Errors;
import com.inversoft.rest.ClientResponse;

public class DeleteApplication {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApplicationProperties.setupProperties();

    // Instantiate the client
    FusionAuthClient client = new FusionAuthClient(ApplicationProperties.getApiKey(),
        ApplicationProperties.getFusionAuthURL());

    UUID appId = UUID.fromString("991001b4-d196-4204-b483-a0ed5dbf7666");

    // Use the returned ClientResponse object
    ClientResponse<Void, Errors> response = client.deleteApplication(appId);

    if (response.wasSuccessful()) {
      // Output the application's details
      System.out.println("Deleted!");

    } else {
      // Handle errors
      System.out.println(response.errorResponse);
    }
  }
}
```
