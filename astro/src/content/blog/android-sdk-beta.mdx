FusionAuth's new beta SDK streamlines mobile development for iOS and Android, offering powerful backend capabilities and seamless integration with your preferred frameworks.

Recently, the team released a software development kit (SDK) Beta for [Android](/docs/sdks/android-sdk) which eliminates boilerplate code, leading to cleaner and more efficient applications.

## The Android SDK

The FusionAuth Android SDK aims to provide a simple and trustworthy interface to authenticate mobile users with FusionAuth.

### Difference to AppAuth

For OAuth 2.0 authentication, the Authentication Manager uses [AppAuth](https://appauth.io/) to handle the authentication flow. AppAuth is an open-source library that provides a simple interface for authenticating users with OAuth 2.0. It's available for [Android](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android) and [iOS](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS).

Using AppAuth directly might seem a good idea because it grants more control over the implementation, but there are compelling reasons to use the FusionAuth Android SDK instead.

1. **Simplified Authentication Flow**: The SDK simplifies the process of authenticating users with FusionAuth by providing a simple interface.

2. **Standardized Usage**: The SDK introduces standardized usage with the introduction of the Authorization Manager.

3. **Security**: The SDK handles best practice defaults in the Authorization Configuration.

4. **Time-Saving**: The SDK handles all dependencies and best practice defaults for you.

5. **Maintainability**: The SDK gives us the flexibility to add additional functionality without having to feature creep the AppAuth library, or implement features early until they get added to AppAuth.

### Getting Started

To simplify the experience, our primary goal was to introduce a minimum effort from the start. With a single import and a simple as possible configuration, which handles all dependencies and best practice defaults for you through the [Authorization Configuration](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-android-sdk/blob/main/library/docs/library/io.fusionauth.mobilesdk/-authorization-configuration/index.md).

    tags="forDocSiteGettingStarted" />

### Usage

Our secondary goal with the SDK was the standardization of the usage with, for example, the introduction of the [Authorization Manager](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-android-sdk/blob/main/library/docs/library/io.fusionauth.mobilesdk/-authorization-manager/index.md).

### Security

With the simplified start in the [Authorization Configuration](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-android-sdk/blob/main/library/docs/library/io.fusionauth.mobilesdk/-authorization-configuration/index.md) and standardized usage in the [Authorization Manager](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-android-sdk/blob/main/library/docs/library/io.fusionauth.mobilesdk/-authorization-manager/index.md) we now took care of best practice defaults. as well as handling token storage, refresh, and retrieval in the [Token Manager](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-android-sdk/blob/main/library/docs/library/io.fusionauth.mobilesdk/-token-manager/index.md).

What we didn't want to change is the AppAuth authentication flow through a browser redirect. When using a browser redirect to the SSO URL, the only application that sees or holds sensitive user credentials is FusionAuth. Your application code never has access to these, which decreases the attack surface area.

In addition, FusionAuth has built-in security features such as:

* the ability to lock user accounts
* password rules
* webhook notifications when a user has failed to login
* breached password notification (with a paid license)
* rate limiting of sensitive security-related actions (with an Enterprise license)
* and more

[FusionAuth takes security seriously](/platform/security); it's our full-time job. By redirecting to FusionAuth, you don't have to worry about any other part of your application getting access to sensitive information or credentials.

### Look and Feel

Do you typically want your login pages to look like your Mobile App? Doesn't a browser redirect make that difficult?

No, FusionAuth allows complete control over the look and feel of the hosted login pages. Learn more about this functionality, which we call [themes](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/), including an [example using Tailwind CSS](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/tailwind).

Being able to make the look and feel the same as your mobile app if your users use the same SSO page design for other use cases, e.g., your online store or portal. It will create more trust because the experience (including design, SSO URL, and authentication process) will be the same on mobile as anywhere else.

### Example

We've built an App for [ChangeBank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXDxNCzUspM), a global leader in converting dollars into coins.

## In Conclusion

With the introduction of the FusionAuth Android SDK Beta, we're eager to finalize the development into a final release and are looking forward to doing this with your feedback.

Especially as the SDK is set to standardize and secure your authorization processes in your mobile application development. We're interested to see if it helps your development, whether you're getting started or looking for a way to standardize and secure your authorization processes in your Android App.

## More details on the SDK and collaboration

We created detailed documentation of the SDK and made it available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-android-sdk/) of the SDK.
