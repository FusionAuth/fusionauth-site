INTRO TBD

{/* more */}

OVERVIEW TBD

Recently, the team built software development kits (SDKs) to make it even easier for Android developers which is now available in beta:

* [Android](/docs/sdks/android-sdk)

## The Android SDK

The goals of this Mobile SDK are to provide a simple and trustworthy interface to authenticate the mobile users with FusionAuth. The FusionAuth Android SDK allows you to add different OAuth2 and OpenID Connect functionalities to your Android application.

It's intended to be a highly standardized and simplified starting point for developers to easily integrate FusionAuth their own custom mobile apps by taking care of all the dependencies. And deliver a set of end-to-end integrated and tested sets of libraries.

### Example

TBD

Here's a example from the [Android quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-android-java-native-fusionauth-sdk).

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-javascript-angular-web/main/complete-application/src/app/app.component.ts" lang="typescript"/>

### Functionality

TBD, maybe RemoteCode from README?

### Difference to AppAuth

TBD

Usage ..

Additional functionality ..

### Security

TBD

Explain redirection to mobile default browser for SSO.

When using a redirect, the only application that sees or holes sensitive user credentials is FusionAuth. Your application code never has access to these, which decreases the attack surface area.

In addition, FusionAuth has built-in security features such as:

* the ability to lock user accounts
* password rules
* webhook notifications when a user has failed to login
* breached password notification (with a paid license)
* rate limiting of sensitive security related actions (with an Enterprise license)
* and more

[FusionAuth takes security seriously](/security); it's our full-time job. By redirecting to FusionAuth, you don't have to worry about any other part in your application getting access to sensitive information or credentials.

### Look and Feel

TBD

Additional functionality and security are great, but you typically want your login pages to look like your Mobile App. Doesn't a browser redirect make that difficult?

Well, no. FusionAuth allows complete control over the look and feel of the hosted login pages, including adding or removing HTML, CSS, images, and JavaScript to the pages. Learn more about this functionality, which we call [themes](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/), including an [example using Tailwind CSS](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/tailwind).

By side the look and feel being the same as your mobile app, if your users use the same SSO page design for other use cases e.g. your online store or portal it will create more trust because the experiencing (including design, SSO URL, and authentication process) will be the same on mobile as anywhere else.

### The Server Side Component

TBD? do we need to add any example on how to securely talk to backend/data APIs? Or explain the difference between the client side implementation in e.g. Angular?

## In Conclusion

TBD
