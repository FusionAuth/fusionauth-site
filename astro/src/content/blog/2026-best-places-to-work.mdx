We're proud to share that FusionAuth has been recognized by Built In as a 2026 Best Place to Work winner in both Seattle and Denver.

Now in its eighth year, Built In's Best Places to Work program honors companies whose compensation, benefits, and culture set the standard for today's workforce. The program uses a data-driven methodology that assesses compensation, benefits, and company-wide culture programs—recognizing organizations that prioritize both performance and people.

“We don’t believe great work comes from micromanagement, performative perks, or burnout culture,” said Brian Bell, CEO of FusionAuth. “We’ve built FusionAuth to be a place where smart, kind people are empowered and trusted to do meaningful work—where craft, ownership, and accountability are expected, not micromanaged. This recognition reflects that intention.”

## What Makes FusionAuth Different

We apply the same philosophy to our workplace that we bring to our software: flexibility without chaos, autonomy without isolation, and ownership without politics. Teams are trusted to make decisions that drive impact and take real responsibility for outcomes.

Here's what that looks like in practice:

**Real flexibility, not lip service.** Our product runs anywhere: cloud, on-prem, hybrid, and air-gapped. Our team works the same way. We've built a remote-friendly, hybrid environment across Denver, Seattle, and beyond because great talent isn't confined to a single zip code.

**Low-ego, high-craft culture.** Authentication is a trust-based industry. We value technical depth, clear thinking, and kindness over titles and noise. That means thoughtful code reviews, comprehensive documentation, and taking the time to understand the security implications of every decision.

**Benefits that support real life.** Unlimited PTO, comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, 401k match, and generous parental leave—benefits focused on long-term wellbeing, not flashy perks.

**Direct access to expertise.** There are no escalation mazes here. When customers need help, they talk to engineers who built the product. That same accessibility extends internally—everyone has a voice and is empowered to use it.

## Building for What's Next

This recognition comes at a pivotal moment. Our recent [acquisition of Permify](/blog/fusionauth-acquires-permify), the open-source fine-grained authorization service, reflects where we see identity heading.

In our customer conversations over the last 18 months, the requirements for access control have gone from simple role-based access control (RBAC) to highly complex, contextual demands. AI agents move faster than humans and behave non-deterministically. They access more data, take more actions, and operate at machine speed. Without fine-grained authorization as a control plane, these systems can overstep quickly.

We're a team that solves these problems—and we're expanding across engineering, sales, and marketing as we work toward unifying authentication and authorization into a single platform.
