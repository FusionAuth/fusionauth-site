In our previous post, [Announcing FusionAuth 1.59.0 - The Identity Ibex](/blog/announcing-fusionauth-1-59), we explored the shift towards separate Email and Phone Identities. This was a foundational change that treated phone numbers as first-class identities, but the user journey still largely followed the traditional "Register first, Verify later" pattern.

While that works for many, it leaves a gap where unverified data can clutter your systems and bots can skew your metrics. With the release of FusionAuth 1.62.0, we've introduced a powerful new capability to bridge that gap: **Identity Pre-Verification**. This allows you to verify a User's Identity *before* they are ever created in your database.

## Why Implement Identity Pre-Verification?

Identity Pre-Verification is a game-changer for maintaining a clean, secure, and high-integrity user database. Here is why it belongs in your registration strategy:

- **Eliminate "Zombie" accounts**: In traditional flows, a User record is created immediately upon form submission. If the Email or Phone number is never verified, you end up with "zombie" accounts pending registrations that never complete. This clutters your database, skews your analytics, and creates unnecessary overhead. Pre-Verification ensures a User record is only created *after* proof of ownership is established.
- **Stop Registration Spam at the Source**: Bots and malicious actors often use fake or stolen identities to create accounts. By requiring Identity Pre-Verification as an atomic part of the registration flow, you prevent these accounts from ever being provisioned. This reduces the attack surface and keeps your user base authentic.
- **Improved User Experience and Recovery**: Have you ever tried to sign up for a service, only to be told your Email is already in use because of a typo or a forgotten, unfinished registration from months ago? Identity Pre-Verification keeps the Identity "unclaimed" until successful verification, preventing these collisions and making the signup process smoother for genuine users.
- **Better Data Privacy and Compliance**: By not storing unverified PII (Personally Identifiable Information) in your primary user table, you simplify your data governance and minimize the amount of data you need to manage for users who may never actually become customers.

## What Is Required For Identity Pre-Verification?

To get started with built-in Identity Pre-Verification in FusionAuth, you'll need the following:

- **FusionAuth 1.62.0**: Ensure you are running the latest version to access these features.
- **A Licensed Paid Plan**: While basic verification is available to all, enforcing Pre-Verification via Advanced Registration Forms is a premium feature.
- **Messaging Configuration**: You must have a configured SMTP server for Email or a Messenger (like Twilio) for SMS Verification.
- **Tenant Identities Enabled**: In your Tenant settings under the <Breadcrumb>Identities</Breadcrumb> tab, you must enable <InlineField>Verify identity</InlineField> for either Email or Phone.
- **Advanced Registration Form**: You'll need to create a Form that includes a **Verification** step between the identity collection step (e.g., Email) and the final account creation step (e.g., Password).

## What Does Identity Pre-Verification Not Solve?

While Identity Pre-Verification is a robust tool for data integrity, it's important to understand its boundaries:

- **Ownership vs. Identity**: It confirms the user has access to the Email or Phone number (ownership). It does not verify their real-world identity (e.g., government ID, background check, or credit score).
- **Bot Mitigation**: While it stops bots from creating *accounts*, it doesn't stop them from triggering verification messages (SMS/Email pumping). You should always use [CAPTCHA](/docs/operate/secure/advanced-threat-detection#captcha) and [Rate Limiting](/docs/operate/secure/advanced-threat-detection#customizable-rate-limiting) to protect your messaging costs and reputation.

## Setting Up Identity Pre-Verification

To enable Pre-Verification, you will need to configure your messaging, update your Tenant settings, and create an Advanced Registration Form.

### 1. Configure Messaging

Identity Verification requires a way to send codes or links to your Users.

* **Email**: Navigate to <Breadcrumb>Tenants -> Your Tenant -> Email</Breadcrumb> and configure your SMTP settings. Ensure a test email is delivered successfully.
* **Phone**: Navigate to <Breadcrumb>Settings -> Messengers</Breadcrumb> and add a Messenger (such as Twilio). Then, go to <Breadcrumb>Tenants -> Your Tenant -> Identities</Breadcrumb> and select your Messenger in the "Messaging settings" section.

### 2. Enable Tenant Identity Verification

Once messaging is configured, you must enable Verification for the Identity types you wish to use.

1. Navigate to <Breadcrumb>Tenants -> Edit Tenant -> Identities</Breadcrumb>.
2. In the "Identity verification settings" section for either **Email** or **Phone**:
    * Enable <InlineField>Verify identity</InlineField>.
    * Select the appropriate template (`Email Verification` or `Phone Verification`).
    * Set <InlineField>Unverified behavior</InlineField> to `Gated`.

### 3. Create An Advanced Registration Form

Verification is enforced through an [Advanced Registration Form](/docs/lifecycle/register-users/advanced-registration-forms).

First, ensure that the Identity field is mandatory. Navigate to <Breadcrumb>Customizations -> Form Fields</Breadcrumb> and verify that <InlineField>user.email</InlineField> or <InlineField>user.phoneNumber</InlineField> has <InlineField>Required</InlineField> set to `true`.

<Aside type="caution" nodark="true">
    Identity Verification only works with the <InlineField>user.email</InlineField> and <InlineField>user.phoneNumber</InlineField> Form Fields. Do not use custom fields as they are not Identity types.
</Aside>

Next, create the Form by navigating to <Breadcrumb>Customizations -> Forms</Breadcrumb>:

* **Step 1**: Add the Identity field (<InlineField>Email address</InlineField> or <InlineField>Phone number</InlineField>).
* **Step 2**: Add a **Verification** step, selecting the corresponding Verification type.
* **Step 3**: Add any other required fields, such as <InlineField>First Name</InlineField>.
* **Step 4**: Always add the <InlineField>Password</InlineField> field as the final step.

### 4. Enable Self-Service Registration

Finally, link the Form to your Application. Navigate to <Breadcrumb>Applications -> Your Application -> Registration</Breadcrumb>:

1. Enable <InlineField>Self-service registration</InlineField>.
2. Set the <InlineField>Registration type</InlineField> to `Advanced`.
3. Select your new Form in the <InlineField>Advanced Registration Form</InlineField> dropdown.

<Aside type="note" nodark="true">
    Application Registration Verification is deprecated. When using Identity Pre-Verification, do not enable Registration Verification on the Application. Use Advanced Registration Forms with a Verification step instead.
</Aside>

## A Kickstart Example

Setting up Identity Verification can be done entirely via [Kickstart](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/kickstart), making it easy to replicate across environments. FusionAuth Kickstart is a declarative tool that allows you to automate the setup of your FusionAuth instance.

You can find a collection of examples in the [FusionAuth Kickstart Example repository](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-kickstart). In particular, the [Identity Pre-Verification example](https://github.com/sonderformat-llc/fusionauth-example-kickstart/tree/feat/identity-pre-verification/identity-pre-verification) provides a reference implementation. This example is not a complete project, but rather a way to provide you with an easy start to understanding the feature and what is required for it.

Make sure when using this example to replace `"licenseId": "REPLACE_LICENSE_KEY"` with your Enterprise Non-production key.

The example `kickstart.json` template does more than just enable Verification; it bootstraps a complete working environment. At a high level, it:

1. **Creates Email Templates**: Provisions all necessary system templates, including `Email Verification`.
2. **Creates Message Templates**: Sets up SMS templates like `Phone Verification`.
3. **Configures The Tenant**:
- Enables SMTP with Mailcatcher as a receiver
- Sets the <InlineUIElement>Identity verification settings</InlineUIElement> like:
  - <InlineField>Email Verify identity</InlineField> to `true`.
  - <InlineField>Email Verification template</InlineField> to the provisioned `Email Verification`.
  - <InlineField>Unverified behavior</InlineField> to `Gated`.
4. **Defines Form Fields**: Creates mandatory <InlineField>user.email</InlineField> and <InlineField>user.password</InlineField> fields.
5. **Creates An Advanced Registration Form**: Builds a custom Registration Form with a `verifyEmail` step.
6. **Configures The Application**: 
  - Enables Self-Service Registration with the `Advanced` type.
  - Associates the custom Form.
7. **Provisions Users**: Creates both an administrative User and a test User (Richard Hendricks), pre-registering them to their respective Applications.
