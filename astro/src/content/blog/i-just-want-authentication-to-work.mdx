Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity. It is a fundamental security measure that is used in a wide variety of applications, including web applications, mobile apps, and APIs. The thing is I just don't care about figuring it out! I just want it to work!!

{/* more */}

There are many different ways to implement authentication, but the most common approach is to use a username and password. Yep, just like back in 1960 when [The Everly Brothers](https://youtu.be/KtY3L5tDN_E?si=BATB3BzJJFpWsHmB) had one of the top songs out there, this method is still most popular today. In my opinion, just like I have never heard this song before, I don't want to hear about passwords any more either!

Another common authentication method is to use a single sign-on (SSO) solution. SSO solutions allow users to log in to multiple applications using a single set of credentials. This can be convenient for users, as they do not have to remember multiple usernames and passwords. This method came about around the same time Eminem hit the [billboard top 100](https://youtu.be/6mPCy9LMxTI?si=5A2I-N1neb_8rGOl) so at least this is in my wheelhouse.

My point is that Authentication is an important security measure, but it can also be complex to implement. This is why we have been hanging on to these old methods so long! When you are creating a new application (unless it is one for Authentication) the last thing you care about is trying to roll your own. There are many different authentication methods to choose from, and each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, authentication needs to be implemented in a secure way to prevent attackers from gaining unauthorized access to applications. When all I care about creating is the next [Napster](https://youtu.be/CKrdsGdLVQ8?si=bTp4DHKS4tlpQzfW) so everyone can share their 1990's music with me again!

## The benefits of using an authentication service

There are many benefits to using an authentication service. Authentication services can help you to:

* Save time and money: Implementing and maintaining authentication can be time-consuming and expensive. Authentication services can save you the hassle of having to implement and maintain your own authentication system.
* Improve security: Authentication services can help you to improve the security of your applications by using best practices and the latest security technologies.
* Reduce the risk of compliance violations: Authentication services can help you to meet compliance requirements by providing features such as two-factor authentication and user provisioning.

The last thing that I want is a call on Saturday night that someone hacked our password database that we built in house and didn't secure!

## Choosing an authentication service

When choosing an authentication service, there are a few factors to consider:

* Features: Consider the features that are important to you, such as two-factor authentication, user provisioning, and support for different authentication methods.
* Pricing: Authentication services can vary in price. Compare the pricing of different services to find the best deal for your needs.
* Ease of use: Consider how easy the authentication service is to use. You want a service that is easy to set up and manage.
* Hosting: Do you need flexibility to host your own instance of an Authentication Provider or have them Host.

## For developers who don't care about implementing authentication

If you are a developer who doesn't care about implementing authentication, there are a few things that you can do to make your life easier:

* Use an authentication service. There are many different authentication services available, both free and paid. Authentication services can save you the hassle of having to implement and maintain your own authentication system.
* Use a framework or library that provides authentication functionality. There are many different frameworks and libraries available that provide authentication functionality. Using a framework or library can save you the time and effort of having to implement authentication yourself. If you are ready to get started checkout our [quickstarts](/docs/quickstarts/).
* Consider when that Napster, wait I mean your app starts to grow and now you need authentication for mobile, desktop and web. You will want an Authentication provider that can handle each form of Authentication.
