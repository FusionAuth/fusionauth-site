Many blogs on authentication and authorization are often very technical in nature. Recently, at an event dedicated to real world ID, I was pondering the connection between the authorization flows and the real world. After talking with someone who was not technical but well versed in real world applications of identity, I tried to explain the authorization flow in a real world example he may be able to more easily understand. I think I came up with a pretty good analogy. (In all honesty, the one I came up with initially was pretty terrible. After thinking about it a bit, I came up with this one that I think is good.) Hopefully if you're not technical or into authentication, this will give you a basic understanding of the flow. If you are technical, this can give you a way to explain what you do to your family and friends at the next holiday gathering.

Let's start off by saying that it is understood that analogies are a double edge sword. They can simplify things tremendously if there is a connection with your target but can also backfire if your target has a different concept or experience with the object of the analogy. That being said, I hope for this post to inspire some interaction. I would love to hear your thoughts on how to better refine the analogy or extend it. If at any point in this read you find yourself saying “That doesn't make sense!” or “I think this would work better if….” please jump in the FusionAuth [forum post on the subject](../community/forum/) and chime in.

Geek stuff ahead. This section contains some technical information about the Authorization Code flow for those with a technical background. It is not necessary to understand the analogy if you want to skip it.

The typical authorization flow typically involves a few entities: A User, A Client Application, An Authorization Server, and a Resource Server. The flow generally involves:
- The user initiates a request. The user attempts to access a protected resource.
- The client application redirects to the authorization server.
- User authenticates. The authorization server verifies the user's identity.
- Authorization server issues a token called a [JWT](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/tokens).
- Client uses the token to access the resource.
- The Resource server validates the token and the user is granted access.

## Airport Analogy For Authorization Code Flow

- The user is represented by you (a traveler).
- The client application is the airport.
- The Authorization Server is the TSA (Transportation Security Administration). If you are from outside of the United States, you can just think of this as airport security. The airline is also considered part of the authorization server here because they are the ones that issue the boarding pass.
- The Access Token is the boarding pass.
- The resource server is the gate your plane leaves from.

So let's walk through this analogy together, from check-in to takeoff.

You (the user) wake up early, caffeinate appropriately, and head to the airport. You've got a destination in mind, let's say maybe beautiful Colorado. You can't just show up and expect to walk straight onto a plane. First, you interact with the airport, our stand-in for the client application. The airport is the one coordinating the trip on your behalf. They know which flight you're taking, what time you need to check in, and where to direct you. They manage the process of getting you to your destination.

When it's time to go through security, the airport directs you to the TSA, which represents the authorization server in our metaphor. This is the critical gatekeeper responsible for verifying your identity. Behind the scenes, the airport has agreed to trust the TSA. You hand over your credentials, usually a government-issued ID and your boarding pass. You can think of the boarding pass as your requested scopes for access to the gates. The TSA doesn't care which airline you flew with last week, they just want to validate that you are you, and that you're permitted to travel.

Once you pass that check, TSA has verified that you are you and you can proceed to the restricted resource. In this case the gates. The analogy breaks down a bit here as the boarding pass now becomes our metaphorical access token and was issued by the airlines and not the TSA. For the purpose of this analogy, We'll lump the TSA and the airline check-in counter into one metaphorical group we'll call 'security & validation.' Together, they handle verifying your identity, issuing your pass, and ensuring you're legit to board. The combination could even be considered multi-factor authentication. In the real authentication flow the authentication server would issue a JWT, which is the actual token used in the authentication flow. This token contains information about who you are, where you're going, and what you're allowed to access. Maybe you're seated in economy or maybe you've got gold status and access to all the snacks and reclining chairs. That's encoded in the token. It's signed, tamper-proof, and TSA doesn't need to follow you around anymore. They trust the pass to do the job.

Now that you're armed with your access token, you head into the gates. This is the resource server and the protected parts of the system. When you present your boarding pass at the gate, the airline staff use your boarding pass to validate that you have access to the resource. They scan the token (the boarding pass), validate it, and if it checks out you're granted access to board the plane.

If your boarding pass says Gate B42 and you're trying to slide into the first-class lounge at A18, guess what? You're getting turned away. The resource server is enforcing authorization rules based on your token. You may be authenticated, but you're not authorized for that resource. That's a crucial distinction in auth land.

Also worth mentioning: that boarding pass has an expiration time. Just like a token, it's only valid for a certain period. You can't use yesterday's pass to board today's flight.

And there you have it.

From the moment you booked you arrive at the airport to the moment you buckle in at 30,000 feet, your journey through the airport is surprisingly similar to how modern authorization systems work. You, the traveler, initiate the process. The airport (client app) facilitates it. TSA (auth server) validates your identity and issues a token (in conjunction with the airlines). The gate (resource server) checks that token and enforces what you can and can't do. Everyone plays a role. Everyone follows the rules. And hopefully, no one gets pulled into a random pat-down.

Happy flying.
