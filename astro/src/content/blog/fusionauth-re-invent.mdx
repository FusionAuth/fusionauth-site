AWS re:Invent is one of the largest technical conferences in the world. In the cloud space, it is the go-to event. This week there will be tens of thousands of attendees in Las Vegas, Nevada. The [FusionAuth team will be among them](/aws-reinvent22), and we'd love to see you.

## Why the team is attending

We're going to re:Invent for many reasons.

One is that FusionAuth and our clients often deploy on the AWS public cloud. Some clients use vanilla EC2 instances with RDS, others deploy on solutions like EKS and Fargate (yes, [FusionAuth supports Kubernetes](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/kubernetes/fusionauth-deployment)).

AWS re:Invent is an opportunity to meet developers where they are at, both during talks and in the ever-present hallway track. We look forward to exchanging knowledge and ideas with folks building on the AWS platform.

We're also excited to chat with attendees about auth. We like to hear from developers about what they are building on top of solutions like FusionAuth, Auth0 and Cognito.

You can migrate from [Auth0](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/bulk/auth0) to FusionAuth and we're of course happy to help. Migrating away from Cognito isn't as straightforward, but [there are ways](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/bulk/cognito).

We're also looking forward to some AWS re:Invent sessions. Exciting ones include "Machine-to-machine authentication on AWS", "Security best practices for Amazon Cognito applications" and "Build resilient applications using Amazon RDS and Aurora PostgreSQL". While many sessions' videos are published to the Amazon Web Services YouTube Channel (here's a perennial fav: [Becoming an AWS Policy Ninja using AWS IAM and AWS Organizations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hETtXCqX_Zc)), you can't beat the in-person experience for spontaneous connection and q&a.

Of course, it isn't all education. There's also fun to be had!

One fun thing to do is join [Corey Quinn's annual nature walk](https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/aws-re-invent-what-you-actually-need-to-know-before-you-go/) where he skewers Expo vendors. This is happening on Wednesday at 1pm.

There are also numerous parties. If you are attending AWS, chances are at least one vendor has emailed you with an invite. This Twitter account, [@reInventParties](https://twitter.com/reInventParties/), is a great way to discover additional opportunities for fun.

Finally, if nature is your thing, we've heard [Red Rock Canyon](https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/nevada/red-rock-canyon) has good hiking and climbing.
