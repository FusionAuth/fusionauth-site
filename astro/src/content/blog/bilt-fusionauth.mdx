### Definitions

- **Single-tenant architecture:** A deployment model where each customer has their own dedicated instance of the authentication system, eliminating the security and performance risks associated with shared infrastructure while providing complete control over data residency and customization.
- **Identity Provider (IdP) tax:** Hidden costs in authentication solutions that scale unpredictably with user growth, often making successful businesses pay disproportionately more for the same core functionality, which FusionAuth's transparent pricing model specifically avoids.
- **CIAM (Customer Identity and Access Management):** Specialized identity management systems designed for customer-facing applications that require scalability, user experience optimization, and integration flexibility, distinct from employee-focused IAM solutions.
- **API-first design:** An architectural approach where all functionality is exposed through comprehensive APIs before building user interfaces, enabling seamless automation, custom integrations, and programmatic management of authentication workflows.
- **Deployment sovereignty:** The ability to maintain complete control over where and how your authentication infrastructure runs, including data residency, version control, and integration with existing CI/CD pipelines, which is critical for regulated industries like fintech.

## The Problem

[Bilt](https://www.biltrewards.com/) is a housing and neighborhood commerce network founded by Ankur Jain, and operated by a team of large-scale software and infrastructure veterans. The company allows renters to earn rewards through paying their rent. With millions of users logging in from around the country (particularly when rent is due), scaling and compliance were of the utmost importance.

The company had some technical needs that were non-negotiable:

- Serve millions of users
- Deploy to GCE
- Must integrate with their CI/CD pipeline
- All data had to stay within the [Google Cloud](/partners/google-cloud) environment

As Bilt evaluated the options in the market, they found roadblocks. Many of the pure [multi-tenant SaaS CIAM](/blog/multi-tenant-hijack) options looked appealing at first, but fell short on closer inspection. Some lacked the robust features that Bilt needed, or they didn't meet the security posture required for a financial platform of Bilt's scale. Still, others were too rigid in their deployment options, forcing user data outside of Bilt's direct control–which was a non-starter.

Cost predictability was another sticking point. Most solutions used billing models that seemed reasonable as long as your business stayed small. But if you grew, those costs turned unpredictable and almost punitive. This was especially true with Bilt's cyclical bursts of usage patterns (Rent Day, limited time experience drops, and more). In the end, other tools couldn't deliver the right mix of features, flexibility, and price transparency.

## The Solution

Bilt proceeded with FusionAuth for two main reasons:

- First, it's a downloadable piece of software where they're completely in charge of version control.
- Second, as a Google Cloud partner, deploying FusionAuth into GCE-managed instance groups was simple. This allowed Bilt's engineers to keep full control over the authentication system, integrating it tightly with the existing CI/CD workflows. It also meant that all user data remained within the Google Cloud infrastructure.

> “Our need was ultimately simple; authentication infrastructure that could handle complex user experiences. FusionAuth has been an excellent partner, delivers the necessary functionality and performance, and maintains active development cycles.” - Kosta Krauth, CTO, Bilt

FusionAuth's dedicated architecture meant that Bilt could scale on-demand and run instances for each environment. This helped the company eliminate the risks of being limited to multi-tenant SaaS only, while also giving them straightforward scalability as their user base grew. The platform's [API-first design](/feature/api-first) made it easy for Bilt's team to automate deployments and manage authentication across multiple environments.

FusionAuth's transparent pricing model (that doesn’t include an [Identity Provider tax](/blog/idp-tax)) was an added bonus, too. This helped the company maintain predictable costs, even as user numbers surged at the start of each month. Procurement happened via the Google Cloud Marketplace, and FusionAuth's engineer-led support gave Bilt confidence that they'd see issues resolved quickly in partnership with authentication experts.

## The Results

With FusionAuth in their authentication stack, Bilt continues to scale its rewards program. The platform handles millions of users and absorbs predictable surges in traffic without missing a beat. By keeping authentication infrastructure within its Google Cloud environment, Bilt is able to maintain operational sovereignty. The engineering team was able to integrate FusionAuth into their CI/CD pipeline, helping to accelerate development and deployment cycles. And with direct access to FusionAuth’s expert support, Bilt’s engineers could focus on building new features rather than firefighting authentication issues.

FusionAuth was a classic “built by devs, for devs” success story – a secure, scalable, and flexible CIAM platform that fit seamlessly into their cloud-native infrastructure and delivered exactly what they needed to power their business at scale.
