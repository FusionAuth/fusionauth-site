"Don understands that developers are running really important parts of today's world and fully embraces our commitment to make auth tools that better protect users while making developer's lives easier," said Pontarelli. "His background and expertise as a growth leader driving exponential revenue and profitability will be a great asset to FusionAuth as we continue to break the mold in terms of how we secure identities and serve developers."

Mr. Bergal comes to FusionAuth with more than 30 years of B2B tech experience with demonstrable growth expertise.  He drove marketing, sales development and sales operations at Avoka while achieving 10x revenue and 50x valuation increases, and was instrumental in the company's acquisition by Temenos. Similarly, he helped to drive Confio Software to 70% annual revenue growth before playing a critical part in the company's acquisition by SolarWinds. 

"I'm thrilled to lead FusionAuth because I recognize the tremendous opportunity the company has in front of it. Customer authentication is a required capability for any app or service, and we have a proven product that has seen tremendous growth over the past 24 months," said Bergal. "The unique approach that FusionAuth takes to identity and access management – creating it for developers – takes a massive security priority and makes it easier, faster, and more scalable. I'm very excited to be on board as we round the next corner."
