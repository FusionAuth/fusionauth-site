In this blog post we’ll cover the most common grant types used in OAuth 2.0 to ensure security for your applications.

## What is OAuth 2.0?

[OAuth 2.0](/articles/oauth/modern-guide-to-oauth) is a widely-used framework that enables secure, delegated access to resources without exposing user credentials. It allows applications to request access on behalf of users through different authorization flows known as **grant types**.

## Key Attributes of OAuth 2.0 Grants

Each grant type includes core components that ensure security and standardization:

- **Client ID & Client Secret**: Identifies the requesting application. Confidential clients use a secret for authentication.
- **Authorization Endpoint**: Redirects users for authentication and consent.
- **Token Endpoint**: Issues access tokens upon authorization.
- **Redirect URI**: Pre-registered URL to prevent redirection attacks.
- **Scopes**: Defines permissions granted (e.g., openid, email, read:messages).
- **Access Token**: A temporary credential allowing access to protected resources.

## Exploring OAuth 2.0 Grant Types

### Authorization Code Grant (Recommended for Most Apps)

Ideal for web and mobile applications with backend servers. The client receives a temporary authorization code, exchanges it for an access token, and secures the communication channel.

### Implicit Grant (Deprecated in OAuth 2.1)

Once used for single-page applications, this flow skips the token exchange step. However, due to security concerns, it is now discouraged in favor of **Authorization Code + PKCE**.

### Client Credentials Grant (Machine-to-Machine Communication)

Used for [server-to-server](/feature/machine-to-machine) communication where no user is involved. APIs use this to securely exchange credentials and obtain access tokens.

## Other Grant Types

- **Resource Owner Password Grant**: Direct authentication using a username/password (not recommended for modern applications).
- **Device Code Grant**: Designed for input-limited devices like smart TVs, allowing users to authenticate via a separate device.

## Choosing the Right Grant Type

To select the best grant type, consider these factors:

1. **Client Type**: Confidential clients (backend apps) vs. public clients (mobile, SPA).
2. **Security Needs**: Use **PKCE** for public clients and **client credentials** for machine-to-machine authentication.
3. **User Experience**: Opt for **device code flow** for limited-input devices and **authorization code flow** for web apps.
4. **Use Case Mapping**: Web apps favor **authorization code**, while backend services use **client credentials**.

## Best Practices for Secure OAuth 2.0 Implementation

- Always use **HTTPS** to encrypt data in transit.
- Set appropriate **token expiration times** to minimize risk.
- Never store tokens insecurely.

## Example: OAuth 2.0 in Action

When you sign in using the Authorization Code Grant in FusionAuth, here’s what happens:

1. The user visits a page to login to your system
2. The user is redirected to FusionAuth’s auth servers to login, and the redirect URL is called with a code.
3. The application exchanges the code for an access token—now it can securely access your data!

## Conclusion

OAuth 2.0 is a powerful framework that, when properly implemented, ensures secure authentication and authorization for web apps, APIs, and devices. Choosing the right **grant type** depends on your application’s security and usability needs.
