We're excited to release FusionAuth 1.61, delivering flexibility where you need it most: managing multiple identity providers, maintaining user trust through password changes, and controlling authentication timing with precision.

We call this release Flexibile Fox because it gives you the agility to adapt authentication to your exact needs. Foxes are known for their intelligence and ability to thrive in diverse environments. So our Flexible Fox knows exactly what you need when managing authentication across multiple tenants, testing new configurations, or balancing security with user experience.

## Multiple Identity Providers, One Instance

You can now configure multiple Google identity providers in a single FusionAuth instance. Each provider runs its own reconcile lambda, giving you the flexibility to handle user data differently across tenants and applications.

This matters when you're running multiple environments. Testing new reconciliation logic no longer means spinning up separate instances or creating custom OIDC providers for platforms that FusionAuth natively supports.

### What this means for your applications

**Test without risk**
Your staging environment can test new user attribute mapping while production continues with its proven configuration. No migration, no disruption, no compromise.

**Deploy with confidence**
When your new reconcile logic proves solid in testing, roll it to production without touching infrastructure or moving users. The transition is seamless because you're already running on the same FusionAuth instance.

**Scale your way**
Different tenants can handle Google authentication differently. Each gets the reconciliation logic that makes sense for its use case.

## SAML ForceAuthN Support

FusionAuth now supports SAML ForceAuthN in both identity provider and service provider configurations. This gives you control over when users must re-authenticate, even when they have an active session.

### Real-world use cases

**Financial transactions**
Force re-authentication when users initiate wire transfers or change payment methods. Active sessions are convenient, but high-value operations demand fresh proof of identity.

**Compliance requirements**
Meet regulatory standards that mandate authentication within specific timeframes. ForceAuthN lets you enforce these policies without building custom workflows.

**Admin operations**
Require fresh authentication before users access sensitive admin panels or modify critical configurations, adding an extra layer of verification where it matters most.

## Seamless MFA Trust Through Password Changes

Users shouldn't have to prove themselves twice for a single task.

We fixed an issue where MFA device trust broke during password changes. Previously, users would complete an MFA challenge during the forgot password flow, check "trust this device," set their new password, and then face another MFA prompt at the next login. The trust they explicitly granted disappeared.

Now when users trust a device during the password change workflow, that trust persists. They complete MFA once, reset their password, and log in smoothly without redundant challenges. Security stays strong, but the experience feels seamless instead of frustrating.

Whether you're managing authentication across multiple environments or ensuring users get secure, frictionless experiences, FusionAuth 1.61 gives you the flexibility and control to handle both.
