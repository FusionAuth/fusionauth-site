The FusionAuth team is proud to announce that we have completed the rigorous audit process and have now earned SOC2 Type II certification for our entire organization, including the FusionAuth product.

For those who have been patiently awaiting this milestone, or those who have been looking for details on FusionAuth security and compliance, this represents the strongest external validation of our company and process. 

<Aside type="note" nodark="true">
FusionAuth has achieved SOC2 Type II certification.
</Aside>

This certification is the result of demonstrating strict security and process controls over the past months and demonstrating compliance to a skilled third party auditor through an extensive examination of our operations. For many organizations, SOC2 is a leading indicator of the maturity and security expertise of their software partners. FusionAuth has worked hard to demonstrate this level of readiness. 

For contracted FusionAuth customers we will confidentially provide a full and detailed audit report upon request.  Please reach out to your FusionAuth support contact or to your account representative for more information. 

The FusionAuth community can rest assured in the fact that SOC2 Type II certification indicates FusionAuth's high level of security commitment, awareness and preparation.
