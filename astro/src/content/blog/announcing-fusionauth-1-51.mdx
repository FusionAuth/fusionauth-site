## The Classic Way of Theming

Before the introduction of the visual, no-code theme editor, customizing the look and feel of your FusionAuth login forms required a more traditional approach. This involved editing HTML, CSS, and occasionally JavaScript directly. While powerful, this method required a certain level of technical expertise and familiarity with web development.

### Overview of Classic Theming

Classic theming in FusionAuth involves the following key components:

- **HTML Templates**: The structure and layout of your authentication pages are defined using HTML templates.
- **CSS Stylesheets**: Custom CSS is used to style these pages according to your branding guidelines.
- **JavaScript**: Optional JavaScript can be included for additional interactivity and functionality.

The classic theming process provides complete control over every aspect of your authentication pages, allowing for highly customized and complex designs. However, it can be time-consuming and challenging, especially for those without a web development background.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Classic Theming

To help you understand the classic theming process, let's walk through a basic example of customizing a login form.

#### Step 1: Access the Theme Management Interface

1. Log in to your FusionAuth administrative dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Customizations** > **Themes**.

#### Step 2: Create a New Theme

1. Click the **Add** button to create a new theme.
2. Enter a name and description for your theme.

#### Step 3: Edit HTML Templates

1. Select the newly created theme from the list.
2. Click the **Edit** button to modify the HTML templates.
3. Customize the HTML code to define the structure and content of your login form. You can use placeholders for dynamic content such as user information and error messages.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Login</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="login-container">
        <h1>Login</h1>
        <form action="/login" method="post">
            <label for="username">Username</label>
            <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required>
            <label for="password">Password</label>
            <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required>
            <button type="submit">Login</button>
        </form>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Step 4: Customize CSS Styles

1. In the theme editor, navigate to the **CSS** tab.
2. Add or modify the CSS to match your brand's styles.

```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

.login-container {
    max-width: 400px;
    margin: 50px auto;
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: #ffffff;
    box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    border-radius: 8px;
}

h1 {
    text-align: center;
    color: #333333;
}

label {
    display: block;
    margin: 10px 0 5px;
    color: #555555;
}

input {
    width: 100%;
    padding: 8px;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    border: 1px solid #dddddd;
    border-radius: 4px;
}

button {
    width: 100%;
    padding: 10px;
    background-color: #007bff;
    border: none;
    color: #ffffff;
    border-radius: 4px;
    cursor: pointer;
}

button:hover {
    background-color: #0056b3;
}
```

#### Step 5: Apply JavaScript (Optional)

1. If you need additional interactivity, navigate to the **JavaScript** tab.
2. Add custom JavaScript code to enhance the functionality of your login form.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    // Example: Add client-side validation
    var form = document.querySelector('form');
    form.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
        var username = document.getElementById('username').value;
        var password = document.getElementById('password').value;
        if (!username || !password) {
            alert('Please fill out all fields.');
            event.preventDefault();
        }
    });
});
```

#### Step 6: Save and Activate the Theme

1. After customizing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, click the **Save** button.
2. Activate the theme by selecting it from the list and clicking the **Activate** button.

Congratulations! You've successfully created a custom theme for your FusionAuth login form using the classic method.

## Comparing Classic and No-Code Theming

With the introduction of the visual theme editor, FusionAuth now offers two distinct approaches to theming: the classic method and the no-code method. Let's compare these two approaches to help you decide which one is right for you.

### Classic Theming

**Pros:**

- Complete control over every aspect of your authentication pages.
- Ability to create highly customized and complex designs.
- Flexibility to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Cons:**

- Requires technical expertise in web development.
- Time-consuming, especially for complex themes.
- Limited to those with coding skills.

### No-Code Theming

**Pros:**

- User-friendly interface accessible to everyone.
- Quick and easy customization with drag-and-drop functionality.
- Real-time previews to see changes instantly.
- No coding required.

**Cons:**

- Limited to the capabilities of the visual editor.
- May not offer the same level of customization as coding.

Ultimately, the choice between classic and no-code theming depends on your specific needs and technical proficiency. If you require complete control and have the necessary coding skills, the classic method may be the best choice. On the other hand, if you want a quick and easy way to customize your authentication pages without writing code, the no-code theme editor is an excellent option.

## Benefits of the Visual Theme Editor

The introduction of the visual, no-code theme editor in the Theming Toucan release brings several benefits to FusionAuth users:

1. **Accessibility**: The no-code theme editor makes it possible for anyone to customize their authentication pages, regardless of their technical expertise. This democratizes the theming process and empowers a broader range of users to create beautiful, branded experiences.

2. **Efficiency**: With the drag-and-drop interface and real-time preview, you can make and see changes instantly. This significantly speeds up the theming process, allowing you to create and deploy custom themes in a fraction of the time it would take using the classic method.

3. **Consistency**: Pre-built templates and style customization options ensure that your themes are consistent and professional-looking. This helps maintain a cohesive brand identity across all your authentication pages.

4. **Flexibility**: While the no-code theme editor is designed to be user-friendly, it still offers a high degree of customization. You can fine-tune styles, adjust element properties, and arrange the layout to meet your specific needs.

5. **Responsive Design**: The theme editor's responsive design features ensure that your authentication pages look great on all devices, from desktops to smartphones. This is crucial in today's mobile-first world.

6. **User Experience**: By simplifying the theming process, the visual theme editor allows you to focus on creating a seamless and enjoyable user experience. This can lead to higher user satisfaction and improved conversion rates.

## Real-World Use Cases

To illustrate the power and versatility of the visual, no-code theme editor, let's explore a few real-world use cases.

### 1. E-Commerce Platform

An e-commerce platform wants to create a branded login page that matches the rest of its website. Using the visual theme editor, the platform's marketing team can quickly customize the login form with the company's colors, logo, and fonts. They can add promotional banners and special offers to the login page, enhancing the user experience and driving sales.

### 3. Educational Institution

An educational institution wants to create a custom login page for its student portal. The IT department can use the visual theme editor to match the login page to the school's branding. They can include important announcements, links to support resources, and a calendar of upcoming events, making the login page a valuable hub of information for students.

### 4. Healthcare Provider

A healthcare provider needs to ensure its patient portal login page is accessible and easy to use. The design team can use the visual theme editor to create a clean and intuitive login form.

## Tips and Tricks for Effective Theming

To help you make the most of the visual, no-code theme editor, here are some tips and tricks for effective theming:

### 4. Test on Multiple Devices

Use the theme editor's responsive design features to test your themes on different devices. Ensure your pages look great and function well on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

### 5. Pay Attention to Accessibility

Make your authentication pages accessible to all users. Use high-contrast colors, large fonts, and keyboard navigation to accommodate users with disabilities.

### 6. Preview Changes in Real-Time

Take advantage of the real-time preview feature to see how your changes will look on the live site. This helps you catch any issues early and make adjustments as needed.
