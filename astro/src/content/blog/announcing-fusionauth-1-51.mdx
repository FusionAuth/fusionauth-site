With the release of FusionAuth 1.51, the platform takes a significant leap forward by introducing a visual, Simple Theme editor, making it easier than ever to customize the look and feel of your authentication pages.

## Overview of the Theming Toucan Release

The FusionAuth 1.51 release, dubbed the "Theming Toucan" release, marks a pivotal moment in the platform's evolution. This update introduces a visual, Simple Theme editor designed to simplify the process of customizing your login forms and other authentication-related pages.

Key highlights of the Theming Toucan release include:

- **Simple Theme Editor**: A user-friendly interface that allows you to customize themes without writing a single line of code.
- **Pre-Built Templates**: Access to a variety of professionally designed templates to get you started quickly.
- **Real-Time Preview**: See your changes in real-time as you edit your themes.

- **Localization**: Ensure your authentication pages are accessible to all users.

This release aims to empower developers and non-developers alike by providing an intuitive way to create beautiful, functional, and branded authentication experiences.

## The Advanced Way of Theming using FusionAuth's Advanced Theme

Before the introduction of the visual, Simple Theme editor, customizing the look and feel of your FusionAuth login forms required a more traditional approach. This involved editing HTML, CSS, and occasionally JavaScript directly. While our advanced themes are powerful, this method required a certain level of technical expertise and familiarity with web development. If you have not seen this check out our [Themes Overview](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/) page to dive a little deeper.

You could use our [Themes API](/docs/apis/themes), [FusionAuth CLI](/docs/customize/cli), or by using the Admin UI like below.

![FusionAuth Admin UI showing Advanced themes](/img/blogs/release-1-51/240530-135039.png)

Advanced Theming in FusionAuth involves the following key components:

- **HTML Templates**: The structure and layout of your authentication pages are defined using HTML templates.
- **CSS Stylesheets**: Custom CSS is used to style these pages according to your branding guidelines.
- **JavaScript**: Optional JavaScript can be included for additional interactivity and functionality.

The Advanced Theming process provides complete control over every aspect of your authentication pages, allowing for highly customized and complex designs. However, it can be time-consuming and challenging, especially for those without a web development background.

You can still edit the Advanced Theme editor from a dropdown within <Breadcrumb>Home / Customizations / Themes </Breadcrumb> like below.

## Comparing Advanced and Simple Theming

With the introduction of the Simple Theme editor, FusionAuth now offers two distinct approaches to theming: the Advanced method and the no-code method. Let's compare these two approaches to help you decide which one is right for you.

### Advanced Theming

**Pros:**

- Complete control over every aspect of your authentication pages.
- Ability to create highly customized and complex designs.
- Flexibility to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Cons:**

- Requires technical expertise in web development.
- Time-consuming, especially for complex themes.
- Limited to those with coding skills.

### Simple Theming

**Pros:**

- User-friendly interface accessible to everyone.
- Quick and easy customization with drag-and-drop functionality.
- Real-time previews to see changes instantly.
- No coding required.

**Cons:**

- Limited to the capabilities of the visual editor.
- May not offer the same level of customization as coding.

Ultimately, the choice between Advanced and no-code theming depends on your specific needs and technical proficiency. If you require complete control and have the necessary coding skills, the Advanced method may be the best choice. On the other hand, if you want a quick and easy way to customize your authentication pages without writing code, the Simple Theme editor is an excellent option.


## Conclusion

The Theming Toucan release of FusionAuth 1.51 introduces a powerful new tool that revolutionizes the theming process: the visual, Simple Theme editor. This user-friendly interface makes it easier than ever to customize your authentication pages, enabling you to create beautiful, branded experiences without writing any code.

Whether you're an experienced developer or a non-technical user, the Simple Theme editor provides the flexibility and efficiency you need to create professional-looking themes quickly and easily. With features like real-time previews and pre-built templates, the Simple Theme editor empowers you to deliver a seamless and enjoyable user experience.
