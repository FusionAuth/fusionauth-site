## Introduction

This post discusses the token-mediating backend (TMB) authentication architecture for OAuth 2 apps: how secure it is, when to use it, and how to implement it.

<Aside type="tip">
This is part two of a three part series on OAuth architectures. Please read [part one](/TODO), if you haven't already, so you understand how the BFF architecture works, since TMB is a variation of BFF.
</Aside>

## What is a Token-Mediating Backend?

The TMB is identical to the BFF pattern, except for one big difference: access tokens are stored in the frontend (desktop app, mobile app, or web app) instead of in the backend. (Refresh tokens are still stored on the backend). Since the access token is now available in the browser, the browser can call a resource server directly, instead of having to call the backend and get the backend to call the resource server with the token.

TMB is described in the IETF document on [best practices for OAuth apps](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-browser-based-apps#name-token-mediating-backend).

## How secure is a TMB?

TMB is massively less secure than BFF (since access tokens in the browser are vulnerable to malicious JavaScript packages and cross-site scripting (XSS)), but slightly more secure than serverless web apps (browser-based OAuth clients (BBOC)), which have no secure backend at all.

You can think of the security advantages as: BFF ≫ TMB > BBOC.

TMB has two of the security advantages of BFF:
- Same-site HTTP-only session cookies, as well as PKCE checks and OIDC nonces, prevent CSRF attacks.
- Refresh tokens stay on the server, hidden from attackers.

But TMB has a significant disadvantage. The access token in the browser can't be kept in an HTTP-only cookie, because JavaScript needs to access it to send it in calls to resource servers (which have different URL domains to the authorization server domain).

Since the access token has to be stored in the browser's local storage, it's vulnerable in all the ways discussed in part 1:
- Malicious npm JavaScript packages can access the token.
- Cross-site scripts (e.g. unsanitized HTML from forum posts on your site) can access the token.

A TMB is slightly more secure than a BBOC because of the server-side refresh token — if you follow best practices.

You can set the expiry period of your access tokens to be very short (ten minutes), so that if an attacker does gain access to the token, they can't use it for long. The frontend can silently ask the server for a new access token generated from the server-side refresh token every ten minutes, so the user does not need to log in again. Or, for security-critical apps like banking, you can require the user to log in again every time their access token expires. If you detect unauthorized use of an access token, you can revoke the refresh token and force a user to log in again.

Of course, if an attacker has managed to insert malicious JS into your frontend, they can steal the access tokens again and again, so access token timeouts won't protect you. Mobile and desktop apps are generally much safer than web apps because they are less likely to use JavaScript.

For a list of best practices to mitigate the danger of client-side token storage, read the recommendations by the the IETF in the [OAuth 2.1 draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9700/), or this [summary](https://maida.kim/oauth2-best-practices-for-developers) by a FusionAuth developer.

### Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP)

There is one relatively new technology (2023) that makes client-side tokens a lot safer — DPoP, standing for Demonstrating Proof of Possession, and available as IETF [RFC 9449](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9449).

DPoP is complicated enough to warrant an entire article, and the [official site](https://dpop.info) has a great visual walkthrough of the protocol, but the concept is simple enough to explain briefly.

If an OAuth access token is like a door key, which can be stolen, using DPoP is like a door that can be unlocked only with the key and having you sign your signature when trying to enter. An attacker with only the key can't open the door because they can't fake your signature.

How it actually works is the access token is cryptographically bound to the DPoP key at creation, and must both be sent to in calls to a resource server. An access token request that isn't signed by the DPoP key will be rejected.

If the attacker can steal the access token in JavaScript, why can't they steal the DPoP key too? The DPoP key is stored using the browser's web cryptography API with [`extractable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CryptoKey/extractable) set to `false`. This means a request to a resource server can be signed with the DPoP key in the browser, but the key can never leave the browser or be seen by JS.

An attacker that manages to insert malicious JS into your browser could make calls using both the DPoP key and access code, but if the attacker exfiltrates the access code to their own machine, it's useless without the DPoP key. So DPoP still doesn't make storing tokens in the browser as secure as using a BFF, but completely eliminates one attack type. Once the user closes their browser, all fraudulent requests must pause.

DPoP is not yet supported by FusionAuth, but [requested](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1679).

## When to use a TMB?
- Only if you cannot, or may not, call a resource server through a proxy (backend) server and must call it through the frontend directly. (Can't think of an example of this, I must go find or LLM one)

The spec only says this:

> When considering a token-mediating backend architecture, it is strongly recommended to evaluate if adopting a full BFF as discussed in Section 6.1 is a viable alternative. Only when the use cases or system requirements would prevent the use of a proxying BFF should the token-mediating backend be considered over a full BFF.

Performance and latency costs could be a reason not to, such as in use cases like game or video streaming and realtime stuff (like collaboration tools like Figma).

Infrastructure can also impact this... like PaaS that are meant to deploy static sites.

But honestly, the one that would probably affect the most people is that, if you're using a third party auth server, many of them use TMB out of the box.


- Aside, FA uses BFF by default, with easy to use hosted backend; perhaps with link to first article’s section on BFF-HB benefits
- Even if your auth provider SDK doesn't provide a hosted backend it's still trivial to create a BFF in a tiny page of JS (see my article here https://fusionauth.io/blog/backend-for-frontend#how-to-create-a-bff-for-a-serverless-app and code here https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-hostedbackend/blob/main/nodeApp/app.js)

## Getting technical: how the TMB flow works
- This section explains the TMB oauth flow
- You can skip it and proceed to the demo in the next section if you don't need to implement or understand the details yourself
- First review the BFF flow in part 1
- Explanation the differences with an example login and resource call, include a diagram
- Potential attacks noted

## Code demonstration
- The section will allow you to run a simple but functional TMB web app and server with FA to see how it works
### Prerequisites
- Docker, Node/Bun/Deno
### Run the app
- Download, configure, run, login, usernames and passwords, screenshots
### How it works
- Briefly describe what's in each file

## Summary
- Brief repeat of the 'when to use section' because of the 'how secure' section.
- Link to FA hosted backend

## Read part 3
- Brief description of what's in that article
