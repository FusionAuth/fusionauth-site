The Game Developers Conference brings the game development community together. This year there will be thousands of attendees in San Francisco, CA the week of March 21st.

The FusionAuth team will be among them, and we'd love to see you.

{/* more */}

## Why the team is attending

While you can use FusionAuth to provide authentication, authorization and user management across many sectors (and our [customers do run the gamut](/customers-partners)), FusionAuth has specific features useful for game developers, including:

* integration with [username and chat profanity filtering](https://cleanspeak.com)
* [Identity Providers](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/identity-providers/) offering out of the box single sign-on with major gaming platforms such as Xbox, Steam, and PS5
* the ability to scale to millions of user profiles and thousands of logins per second

We also have a number of customers in the gaming space. While it's nice to hop on a video chat with them any time to support their implementations, it'll be great to meet in person, share a beverage, and chat face to face.

We're also looking forward to some [sessions](https://schedule.gdconf.com/). Exciting options include "The Art of the Big Con", "Storytelling is Design" and "'Age of Empires IV': Machine Learning Trials and Tribulations". This isn't everything that is interesting to us; there are a lot of great talks and events happening!

And let's not forget the hallway track. You can't beat the in-person experience for spontaneous connection and conversation.

## Meet up with FusionAuth

If you want to meet up with the FusionAuth team at GDC, we're around and ready to chat.

Find us in a couple of places:

* We have a booth in the Expo hall, which will be open Wednesday to Friday. We're between the Arcade Play and the Connect Lounge areas. If you are using the [online GDC map](https://www.expocad.com/host/fx/ubm/22gdc/exfx.html), our booth number is "P1857". Brave the madness and come say hi for a demo, to chat about the intricacies of the Authorization Code grant, or to sign up to win a Lego set, an Oculus Quest, or a PS5.
* The FusionAuth founder and CTO, Brian Pontarelli is talking on Wednesday about [how to handle logins and registrations at scale](https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/growing-to-millions-of-users-how-to-handle-logins-and-registrations-at-scale-presented-by-fusionauth/886274). He'll cover how to prepare with load testing tips, different scaling techniques, and a dive into the typical causes of request latency. 
* We'll be out and about as well. Send us a note via our [contact form](/contact) or tweet/DM [Brian](https://twitter.com/bpontarelli).

Happy GDCing!
