On December 17th we had the first of what will be many Open Office Hours here at FusionAuth and we are damn happy with how it went.{/* more */} The first time out of the gate for anything always brings risks of glitches but everything went down as smooth as a fine whiskey. Check out the video and summary below to see and hear for yourself.

If you missed the this first one, **FusionAuth's Open Office Hours** are free sessions where you can ask us anything you want about identity, authentication and authorization. Of course we can talk about FusionAuth, but we're ready to answer anything about OAuth, OpenID Connect, SAML, RBAC, ABAC, ACLs, security, JWTs, whatever.
