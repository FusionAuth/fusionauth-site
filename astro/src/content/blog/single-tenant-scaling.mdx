## Introduction

This short article will explain exactly what multi-tenancy is, its benefits, and why you should still choose a single-tenant solution in most cases as it scales far better.

## What Is Scaling In Web Applications?

Once you've created an application and released it to the public, you want to be sure that it will still perform well as your number of users increases. The app needs to be able to handle more HTTP and database requests per minute, with higher volumes of data transferred across the Internet, and more transactions of complex business logic. Not only do you need to serve more requests, but do so quickly (latency) and while using as few resources (CPU, RAM, disk, network) as possible to keep costs low. How well your app handles large numbers of users is called its ability to scale.

If you're already using efficient code and technology stack choices to build your app, there're only two ways to scale:
- Vertical scaling (scaling up): Adding more power to existing servers (CPU, RAM, storage).
- Horizontal scaling (scaling out): Adding more servers to distribute load.

## What Is Multi-Tenant Architecture?

The accepted definition of **multi-tenancy** is when **a single instance of software runs on a server and serves multiple tenants**. Think of a project management software website, like Trello or Redmine. The website is multi-tenant if it can serve multiple customers (companies running projects) from one URL. A designer might even work on two different projects at two different companies, both using the same project management software. She would be seen as completely different users under each company (tenant), even though she logs into both companies with the same email address.

But what exactly is a **single instance of software**? What if there is one web server process but multiple databases? Is that still multi-tenant? What about multiple WordPress sites that all store their data in the same database? Or a load balancer that evenly distributes customer requests to multiple, but identical, instances of a web application running on the same server that access the same database?

As you can see, the difference between a multi-tenant and a single-tenant system is continuous, not discrete. An **instance of software** can involve multiple URLs, processes, databases, files, virtual machines, containers, and servers. But for the purposes of this discussion, we can at least define the two clear ends of the spectrum:

- Single-tenant application:
  - Serves one customer, using a single database or file system.
  - To serve another customer it needs a new URL, server (or virtual machine or container), web application, and database.
- Multi-tenant application:
  - Serves many customers, using a single database or shared file system.
  - Can serve many customers from the same URL, server (or virtual machine or container), web application, and database.

The important differences are:
- The number of customers served.
- Data isolation, for security and privacy, in databases or files.
- Server isolation, for the resource load on CPU, RAM, and disk. (With virtual machines and containers, the distinction between virtual and physical servers can get blurry too.)
