## What Is Scaling In Web Applications?

Once you've created an application and released it to the public, you want to be sure that it will still perform well as your number of users increases. The app needs to be able to handle more HTTP and database requests per minute, with higher volumes of data transferred across the Internet, and more transactions of complex business logic. Not only do you need to serve more requests, but do so quickly (latency) and while using as few resources (CPU, RAM, disk, network) as possible to keep costs low. How well your app handles large numbers of users is called its ability to scale.

If you're already using efficient code and technology stack choices to build your app, there're only two ways to scale:
- Vertical scaling (scaling up): Adding more power to existing servers (CPU, RAM, storage).
- Horizontal scaling (scaling out): Adding more servers to distribute load.

## What's the Worst That Could Happen?

If your user base grows slowly and consistently, you might feel comfortable gradually adding RAM and CPU to the cloud server that hosts your app. But there are two dangers:
- Spikes in temporary use, such as when ticket purchase sites crash as bookings for a concert open, or trying to send a chat message on new year's eve.
- Spikes in growth, such as when a competitor changes their terms of service, and thousands of customers register on your site as the alternative.

In both cases if you aren't prepared to scale, you could lose huge amounts of revenue and reputation. You need to be able to rapidly scale up and down for spikes in use, and permanently scale up for spikes in growth.

## Apps That Failed To Scale

Popular online games are notorious for failing to handle large numbers of users. For games that are purchased, such as Diablo with its `Error 37` inability to log in, users will grudgingly wait to play and business won't be much affected. For free-to-play games or monthly subscriptions, the inability to log in, or hour-long queue times, often means players won't give the company a second chance. The launch of Pok√©mon GO in 2016 was a disaster, with millions of players review-bombing the augmented reality mobile game when they couldn't log in, download the game, or even find game locations that weren't empty.

Recent examples include ChatGPT, an AI LLM that is extremely RAM and CPU intensive, which throttles its use in peak times. Even its vastly more efficient Chinese competitor, DeepSeek, which was the most downloaded free app on the Apple mobile store in 2025, had outages with logins and chat responses soon after launch.

Scaling concerns affect even programming languages. PHP's single-process-per-HTTP-request design is one of the reasons programmers flocked to Node.js when it released. With Node's non-blocking IO requests, it was trivial for a junior programmer to write an asynchronous web server to handle thousands of simultaneous requests with no extra work and very little RAM.

## What Is Multi-Tenant Architecture?

One important decision you need to make when choosing infrastructure that can scale is single-tenant architecture versus multi-tenant architecture.

The accepted definition of **multi-tenancy** is when **a single instance of software runs on a server and serves multiple tenants**. Think of a project management software website, like Trello or Redmine. The website is multi-tenant if it can serve multiple customers (companies running projects) from one URL. A designer might even work on two different projects at two different companies, both using the same project management software. She would be seen as completely different users under each company (tenant), even though she logs into both companies with the same email address.

But what exactly is a **single instance of software**? What if there is one web server process but multiple databases? Is that still multi-tenant? What about multiple WordPress sites that all store their data in the same database? Or a load balancer that evenly distributes customer requests to multiple, but identical, instances of a web application running on the same server that access the same database?

As you can see, the difference between a multi-tenant and a single-tenant system is continuous, not discrete. An **instance of software** can involve multiple URLs, processes, databases, files, virtual machines, containers, and servers. But for the purposes of this discussion, we can at least define the two clear ends of the spectrum:

- Single-tenant application:
  - Serves one customer, using a single database or file system.
  - To serve another customer it needs a new URL, server (or virtual machine or container), web application, and database.
- Multi-tenant application:
  - Serves many customers, using a single database or shared file system.
  - Can serve many customers from the same URL, server (or virtual machine or container), web application, and database.

The important differences are:
- The number of customers served.
- Data isolation, for security and privacy, in databases or files.
- Server isolation, for the resource load on CPU, RAM, and disk. (With virtual machines and containers, the distinction between virtual and physical servers can get blurry too.)

## Scaling And Tenancy


Peak-time throttling highlighted the limitations of shared-resource architectures in handling unpredictable demand surges.
