## What Is Scaling In Web Applications?

Once you've created an application and released it to the public, you want to be sure that it will still perform well as your number of users increases. The app needs to be able to handle more HTTP and database requests per minute, with higher volumes of data transferred across the Internet, and more transactions of complex business logic. Not only do you need to serve more requests, but do so quickly (latency) and while using as few resources (CPU, RAM, disk, network) as possible to keep costs low. How well your app handles large numbers of users is called its ability to scale.

If you're already using efficient code and technology stack choices to build your app, there're only two ways to scale:
- Vertical scaling (scaling up): Adding more power to existing servers (CPU, RAM, storage).
- Horizontal scaling (scaling out): Adding more servers to distribute load.

## What's the Worst That Could Happen?

If your user base grows slowly and consistently, you might feel comfortable gradually adding RAM and CPU to the cloud server that hosts your app. But there are two dangers:
- Spikes in temporary use, such as when ticket purchase sites crash as bookings for a concert open, or trying to send a chat message on new year's eve.
- Spikes in growth, such as when a competitor changes their terms of service, and thousands of customers register on your site as the alternative.

In both cases if you aren't prepared to scale, you could lose huge amounts of revenue and reputation. You need to be able to rapidly scale up and down for spikes in use, and permanently scale up for spikes in growth.

## Apps That Failed To Scale

Popular online games are notorious for failing to handle large numbers of users. For games that are purchased, such as Diablo with its `Error 37` inability to log in, users will grudgingly wait to play and business won't be much affected. For free-to-play games or monthly subscriptions, the inability to log in, or hour-long queue times, often means players won't give the company a second chance. The launch of Pokémon GO in 2016 was a disaster, with millions of players review-bombing the augmented reality mobile game when they couldn't log in, download the game, or even find game locations that weren't empty.

Recent examples include ChatGPT, an AI LLM that is extremely RAM and CPU intensive, which throttles its use in peak times. Even its vastly more efficient Chinese competitor, DeepSeek, which was the most downloaded free app on the Apple mobile store in 2025, had outages with logins and chat responses soon after launch.

Scaling concerns affect even programming languages. PHP's single-process-per-HTTP-request design is one of the reasons programmers flocked to Node.js when it released. With Node's non-blocking IO requests, it was trivial for a junior programmer to write an asynchronous web server to handle thousands of simultaneous requests with no extra work and very little RAM.

## What Is Multi-Tenant Architecture?

One important decision you need to make when choosing infrastructure that can scale is single-tenant architecture versus multi-tenant architecture.

The accepted definition of **multi-tenancy** is when **a single instance of software runs on a server and serves multiple tenants**. Think of a project management software website, like Trello or Redmine. The website is multi-tenant if it can serve multiple customers (companies running projects) from one URL. A designer might even work on two different projects at two different companies, both using the same project management software. She would be seen as completely different users under each company (tenant), even though she logs into both companies with the same email address.

But what exactly is a **single instance of software**? What if there is one web server process but multiple databases? Is that still multi-tenant? What about multiple WordPress sites that all store their data in the same database? Or a load balancer that evenly distributes customer requests to multiple, but identical, instances of a web application running on the same server that access the same database?

As you can see, the difference between a multi-tenant and a single-tenant system is continuous, not discrete. An **instance of software** can involve multiple URLs, processes, databases, files, virtual machines, containers, and servers. But for the purposes of this discussion, we can at least define the two clear ends of the spectrum:

- Single-tenant application:
  - Serves one customer, using a single database or file system.
  - To serve another customer it needs a new URL, server (or virtual machine or container), web application, and database.
- Multi-tenant application:
  - Serves many customers, using a single database or shared file system.
  - Can serve many customers from the same URL, server (or virtual machine or container), web application, and database.

The important differences are:
- The number of customers served.
- Data isolation, for security and privacy, in databases or files.
- Server isolation, for the resource load on CPU, RAM, and disk. (With virtual machines and containers, the distinction between virtual and physical servers can get blurry too.)

## Advantages And Risks Of Multi-Tenancy

Multi-tenancy has a lot of advantages. It's simple to server multiple customers with one set of infrastructure. Application and database version upgrades need to be done only in one place.

Shared infrastructure is much cheaper than a dedicated physical server. At the time of writing a dedicated Hetzner server is ten times the price of a shared one. Since shared infrastructure is generally hosted inside Docker, or a shared file system in the case of WordPress servers, it's simple to scale up or down by increasing your share of the physical machine's resources.

The danger of multi-tenant systems is exposing customer data. If you use a single database, every SQL query you write has to be careful to not expose another customer's data. An attacker who gains access to your database, gain access to **all** customers' data. If you're using a shared web server, a single website with a malicious plugin could threaten the data and performance of all other sites on the server.

## Scaling And Tenancy

Multi-tenant systems are especially problematic when it comes to scaling. While these systems are quick to scale up and down in general, there are other dangers.

Not only do you have to worry about load spikes in your application, but also those of noisy neighbours on the shared server. If another app on the same server experiences a sudden spike in HTTP requests or needs to run several CPU-intensive calculations, your app might become unusable. If your app uses the same range of IP addresses for sending email as someone else that sends spam, your emails might be flagged as spam too. These problems are difficult for hosts to manage — generally they warn customers in the short term and require them to upgrade their resource tier, or leave, in the long term.
