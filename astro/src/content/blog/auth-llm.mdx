Nobody knows you better than the internet. And nobody knows the internet better than FusionAuth. Now FusionAuth knows you better than you know yourself.

## Why AuthLLM?

### The curse of success

FusionAuth has been having a great year. In fact, FusionAuth has experienced _hyper-exponential_ growth. So much hiring has been taking place that we were struggling to keep track of our employees.

> "We suddenly had so many 'Dans' that when I screamed for one of them to come to my office, no fewer than four Dans would come running. And I work from home." - Brian Pontarelli, Founder and Occasional CEO

Our old authentication system, while robust, relied on outdated technology like _remembering things_. With the average human attention span now shorter than a goldfish's, and with so many new faces, it was easy to make mistakes.

> "At one point we had a dog writing product requirements. He honestly had some pretty good ideas." - Andy Pai, VP of Product Delivery

### Ex Machina

Something had to be done. Thankfully, with the help of our [expertise in quantum computing](/blog/quantum-computing) and years of [experience with AI](/blog/fusionauth-colorado-company-to-watch), FusionAuth was able to combine reverse deontological behavior embeddings with actual fingerprinting to create a new authentication system that can identify you entirely based on stuff it knows about you from the internet.

## How Does AuthLLM Work?

Using a proprietary blend of data scraped from social media, forum posts, public records, bank statements, healthcare histories, and government surveillance databases, AuthLLM is able to know who you are simply by asking you questions nobody else could possibly answer.

We call this the first true _**Universal Authentication**_ system. This is because you are authenticated against the fundamental properties of the universe itself.

## What Makes AuthLLM Different?

Passwords? Passkeys? Past-tense. Our revolutionary model combines LLM features like thinking, memory, and [Deep Impact](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120647/) research to create a system that is so secure, only your deepest, darkest secrets can unlock it. By answering a series of seemingly random and personal prompts, the AI can determine that only _you_ could have possibly provided the exact responses at the exact time that you did.

The model can predict the next thing you will say, the next thing you will do, and the next thought that will enter your mind. Yes, even _that one_.
