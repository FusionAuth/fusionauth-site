User verification (proof of email address or phone number ownership) is done by the user by entering a code or clicking a link sent to the address they registered with.

The FusionAuth field `user.verified` stores whether the user has completed email verification yet. But as of [FA version 1.59](https://fusionauth.io/docs/release-notes/#version-1-59-0) (August 2025), this field is deprecated. FA now handles verification for each type of identity separately (email and phone).

This article discusses exactly what's changed with verification and how the new features work.

## ⛔ The Old Way Of Verification

Let's summarize the obsolete email verification system from before version 1.59. Even if you're a new user working on the latest version of FA, read this section first, to understandthe verification process of sending and clicking links, which hasn't changed in the new version.

### The Object Model

If you're unfamiliar with FA types, like Tenants, Applications, Users, and Registrations, please review the [documentation](https://fusionauth.io/docs/get-started/core-concepts/types-and-relationships). The relationship diagram below summarizes the types.

Notice that users are members of applications through an object called a registration (because a user "registers", or signs up, to use an application).

![FA type diagram](../../../public/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/core-concepts-relationships-tenants.png)

If you open your FA database, you'll see the user object is split in two tables: `users` and `identities`. The user table holds biographical information like name, birth date, and timezone. The identities table holds multiple records for a user, which might include a username, email address, and phone number. To update users, you should use the FA web interface or the [users API](https://fusionauth.io/docs/apis/users) and mustn't access the database directly, but the user object in the API has the same structure as the database tables so the diagram below should help your understanding.

![Old database](../../../public/img/blogs/how-user-verification-works/oldDatabase.webp)

Verification in FA prior to 1.59 is only for email addresses (and not phone numbers or other identifiers).

Each user identity (email address) has the fields `verified` and `verified_instant`. `verified` is false until the user clicks the verification link, when it becomes true. `verified_instant` is the time at which the user verified.

A registration also has the fields `verified` and `verified_instant`. If the user identity already has a verified field, why does the registration need another verification field? The [application registration tutorial](https://fusionauth.io/docs/lifecycle/manage-users/verification/registration-gate-accounts-until-verified) explains this:
>  However, PiedPiper requires separate registration verification to allow access to both Not-Hotdog and PiperChat through the same email account. This registration verification is a concrete, separate step that the user must engage in by clicking a link or entering a code (sent via email). Without this verification step, **users may find it alarming their logins (jared@piedpiper.com) work for both Not-Hotdog and PiperChat (without their express consent, especially if they did not know about the parent company relationship)**.

This quote explains that a user verifying that they signed up to use an application has a different purpose to a user verifying their email or phone when creating an account in FA, though both procedures are named verification and both send a link the user must click.

### The Verification Process

To see how email verification works, you first need an SMTP server. The simplest way to test is using a fake SMTP service, like [SMTPBucket](https://www.smtpbucket.com).

---

Tenants -> Default -> Select -> Edit -> Email tab
Host: mail.smtpbucket.com
Port: 8025

Enable Verify registrations
Verification template `Registration Verification`


Enable Verify email
Verification template - Choose `Email Verification` template


Save

![Email settings](../../../public/img/blogs/how-user-verification-works/email.webp)

---

Applications -> New (+ button)
Name it `EmailTestApp`
OAuth tab - Authorized redirect URLs - add `http://localhost:9011/registration-complete`, select the value as a dropdown and click it
Registration tab -> Enable self service
Save

Applications -> EmailTestApp -> Select -> View
Copy value from Registration URL field

Paste into browser private tab:

http://localhost:9011/oauth2/register?client_id=ff69a179-d0ff-4265-8584-1cb1b723f73d&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A9011%2Fregistration-complete

Enter

## ✅ The New Way Of Verification

### The Object Model

To understand the new FA verification model, look at the new Identities tab in a Tenant. In the image below you can see the old version of FA on the left and the new version on the right.

The SMTP settings remain in the new version of the Email tab, but the verification settings and email templates have moved to the new Identities tab.

![New Identities tab](../../../public/img/blogs/how-user-verification-works/newIdentities.svg)

However, the Identities tab isn't just for email. FA now supports phone numbers as a unique identifier for users in addition to email addresses. You can see the Identities tab has two columns, with email on the left and identical settings for phone on the right.

As well as identity verification changing, FA has also changed registration verification. **Registration verification has been removed**. FA no longer believes that users "find it alarming their logins" work for two different applications without explicit confirmation.

You can see in the new database diagram below that user identities now hold all verification information, and the fields related to verification in other tables have been deprecated.

![New database](../../../public/img/blogs/how-user-verification-works/newDatabase.webp)

Each identity has a `type`, which might be email, phone, or username. The `value` field contains the actual email address or phone number.

There's also a new field, `verified_reason`. The way a verification is used can be more nuanced than merely true or false. `verified_reason` provides more possibilities.

If the verified reason is one of the values below, then the identity does not require verification (the user is treated as verified), whether or nor `verified` is true or false:

- `Disabled` — Tenant policy did not require verification.
- `Import` — User was imported from an external provider, so verification was not performed by FusionAuth.
- `Skipped` — Tenant policy does not apply any verification gating requirements.
- `Trusted` — Identity was created via an external identity provider or a connector, so verification was not performed by FusionAuth..
- `Unverifiable` — FusionAuth doesn’t know how to verify this identity type. Usernames are an example.

If the verified reason is one of the values below and `verified` is false, then the user does require verification:

- `Completed` — Verification was performed by FusionAuth.
- `Implicit` — Verification was implicitly performed by sending a set password or passwordless message.
- `Pending` — Tenant policy requires verification but no verification has been performed yet.

`verified_instant` will be set only if real verification was done, not when it was skipped.

### The Verification Process

The verification process for email remains the same in the latest versions as the old versions. Phone verification is very similar. In an identical way to email, the user will receive a link to click to confirm registration, or a code they can type into FusionAuth.

To send an SMS message from FusionAuth you need to configure an SMS provider. Whereas SMTP providers for email are configured per tenant, SMS is configured for the whole FA instance in the <Breadcrumb>Settings -> Messengers</Breadcrumb> tab. To separate SMS fees for different clients, you can create multiple Messengers and link each Tenant to their own Messenger.

![SMS settings](../../../public/img/blogs/how-user-verification-works/addMessenger.webp).

You can use the SMS service Twilio, for which FA has an available messenger type (shown above). For another service, you need to use the generic messenger type, and write your own little web service to receive the message, format it for you SMS provider, and forward it on the provider.

### Changes to the user API

If you use the FA users API to programmatically create or manage users, you need to be aware of some changes in the latest version.

In `/api/user GET`: `user.verified` is deprecated field that indicates only whether the user’s primary email identity has been verified. Don't use it. Use `user.identities[].verified` and `user.identities[].verifiedReason` instead.

In `/api/user POST`: `sendSetPasswordEmail` is deprecated. Use `sendSetPasswordIdentityType` instead. (The same applies to the user registration API too.)

In `/api/user/forgot-password POST`: `sendForgotPasswordEmail` is deprecated. Use `sendForgotPasswordMessage` instead.

## Summary

The table below summarizes the differences between the old and new versions of FA verification.

|   | Old version (<1.59) | New version
|---|---                   |---
| Users can confirm their registration for each application | Yes | No, that's deprecated
| User's email and phone numbers are kept in | the user object | multiple separate `user.identity` objects
| The possible user identity types are | email and username | email, username, and phone
| Email verification configuration is done in | the email tab of the tenant | the identities tab of the tenant
| User verification field is found in | `user.verified` | the combined values of `user.identitie[].verified` and `user.identities[].verifiedReason`

From a user perspective, the experience of receiving a link or code to verify identities hasn't changed. To configure SMTP providers (email), use the Tenant page in FA. To configure SMS providers, use the Messengers page in Settings.
