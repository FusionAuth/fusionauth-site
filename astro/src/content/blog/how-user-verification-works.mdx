User verification (proof of email address ownership) is done by the user by entering a code or clicking a link sent to the email address they registered with.

The FusionAuth field `user.verified` stores whether the user has completed verification yet. But as of [FA version 1.59](https://fusionauth.io/docs/release-notes/#version-1-59-0) (August 2025), this field is deprecated.

This article discusses exactly what's changed with verification and how you should verify users now.

## The Old Way Of Verification

For those of you who've used FusionAuth for a while, let's summarize the obsolete verification system you're familiar with. If you're a new FA user working on a database created after version 1.59, you can skip ahead to the next section.

In the database, the table `identities`, which links to the tables `users` and `tenants`, has the fields `verified` and `verified_instant`. A tenant is a way partitioning FA to work for multiple customers in the same database. For example, a user in the Company1 tenant might log in to Company1's website with FusionAuth, and have a completely separate login using the same email address but different password with Company2 (a different tenant), even though both websites use the same FusionAuth database as their authentication provider.

The `user_registrations` table also has the fields `verified` and `verified_instant`, and links to the tables `users`, `applications`, and `user_registrations_applications_roles`. An Application is like a company website or product. So the Company1 tenant might have one application (website) for employees and another application for customers. A user is granted access to an application by creating a Registration — a link between user and application kept in the `user_registrations` table.

If the user record already has a verified field, why does the registration record need another verification field? The [application registration tutorial](https://fusionauth.io/docs/lifecycle/manage-users/verification/registration-gate-accounts-until-verified) explains this:
>  However, PiedPiper requires separate registration verification to allow access to both Not-Hotdog and PiperChat through the same email account. This registration verification is a concrete, separate step that the user must engage in by clicking a link or entering a code (sent via email). Without this verification step, **users may find it alarming their logins (jared@piedpiper.com) work for both Not-Hotdog and PiperChat (without their express consent, especially if they did not know about the parent company relationship)**.


## The New Way Of Verification

Registration verification is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of FusionAuth.

User API

For /api/user GET:

user.verified is now a deprecated field that only indicates whether or not the User’s primary email identity has been verified. This does NOT indicate whether phone number identity types are verified. Use user.identities[x].verified and user.identities[x].verifiedReason instead.

For /api/user POST:

sendSetPasswordEmail is deprecated. Use sendSetPasswordIdentityType instead.

For /api/user/forgot-password POST:

sendForgotPasswordEmail is deprecated. Use sendForgotPasswordMessage instead.

User Registration API

sendSetPasswordEmail is deprecated. Use sendSetPasswordIdentityType instead.
