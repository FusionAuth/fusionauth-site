## What is Web Summit?

Web Summit is one of the world’s largest technology conferences, bringing together over 70,000 attendees from around the globe. It offers a platform for startups, investors, professionals, and tech enthusiasts to connect, learn, and explore the latest in technology and innovation.

This year, Web Summit is happening November 11 through 14.

If this is your first Web Summit, I’m guessing you’ve never experienced an event on this scale before.

The quality of people at Web Summit is high. These are my people. Smart, innovative, positive, exciting. There’s a ton of nighttime side events, it's where a lot of connections are made.

## Why Attend Web Summit?

Attending Web Summit provides unparalleled opportunities to network, gain insights from industry leaders, and discover emerging technologies.

Whether you're looking to pitch your startup, learn from top speakers, or simply soak in the tech atmosphere, Web Summit is the place to be.

### Purpose of the Survival Guide

This guide is designed to help you navigate Web Summit with confidence, ensuring that you make the most of your time (and money), meet the right people, and leave with valuable knowledge and connections. As a 7-time attendee of Web Summit and many other large global events, here are my best tips from personal experience.

## Before You Go

### Getting Your Tickets

There are several ticket options available from general admission to VIP passes. Early registration is key to securing discounts and avoiding last-minute price hikes.

**General Attendees** - €950 (access to speaker content, exhibition halls & Night Summit)

**VIP** - €1,950  (same as general but includes some lounge access)

**Investor** - €1,050 (access to Investor Lounge plus meeting support)

**Chairperson** - €8,995 (Speaker Lounge “Forum” access) 

**ALPHA Startups** - starts at €995 for 3 tickets & 1 day booth

**BETA Startups** - starts at €1595 for 4 tickets & 1 day booth

ALPHA Startups have raised under USD$1 Million & BETA Startups have raised USD$1-5 million.

You need to apply to exhibit (ALPHA & BETA) and after an initial call with the Web Summit team, you might also be invited to participate in PITCH, the Web Summit Pitch competition.

Startup applications close on October 25th.

### Setting Your Goals

A week in Lisbon is time and money taken away from your startup. You need to make this trade worthwhile, define what you want to achieve at Web Summit. Whether it's meeting potential investors, learning about new trends, or simply networking, having clear goals will help you prioritize your time. 

Write them down. 

### Refine Your Elevator Pitch

Create an effective elevator pitch, then shorten it. This is not just for startups. If you work at Google you need a pitch as well. Interactions are short so get the point.

Here are some examples:

*"My startup solves the issues around moving house"*

*"I’m a product manager, looking to find out how to use AI in our platform"*

*"You know Canva? We do a similar thing for architects"*

Then you can add on what you’re looking for:

*"We’re looking to connect with potential partners in Asia"*

### Booking your Accommodation and/or Flights

Book your accommodation early to get the best rates. Consider staying close to the venue to minimize travel time. Look into local transportation options, such as public transit, ride-sharing, or renting a bike/scooter. Lisbon has a range of e-scooters, they are not much cheaper than an Uber/taxi but a lot of fun.

I personally like staying near a [Metro Station](https://www.metrolisboa.pt/en/travel/diagrams-and-maps/) on the Red Line which goes direct to the venue avoiding the traffic jams which usually occur. The Red line is also the airport line which makes it double convenient and the venue is only a few stops from the airport.

### Saving Tips

Book your flight and accommodation as early as you can and consider sharing accommodation with fellow attendees to reduce costs. 

Lisbon is a tourist town so there’s a bunch of Airbnb properties. One of the things I love about Lisbon, is its general affordability as compared to other large conference destinations like London, San Francisco and Hong Kong.

### Pack your Essentials

Here’s some thing you cannot forget:

- Tech gear like power adapters (for non-EU attendees), chargers, and power banks.
- Comfortable shoes for long days on your feet.
- Snacks since food queues can be long; but never eat at your booth.
- One branded shirt for each day.
- Bring a water bottle. There are water refill stations.

### Install the App - NOW!

Web Summit is one of those events where their app is widely used. I know there’s a ton of events that have an app and people don’t use it; Web Summit is not one of them. There’s a ton of value here if it is used correctly. Search for “Web Summit 2024” in your app store and install it. You'll thank me later.
After you've installed the app, do the following.

**Complete Your Profile**

Complete your profile during the registration process adding social media accounts. Spend time making sure it is easy for people to find you via the app.

**Connect with Others**

Send connect requests with a short note saying why you want to connect. You can use the "Explore" feature and filter on various attributes like "Startups that are hiring".

**App Features**

The app has a number of cool features meaning it will be your companion during Web Summit. There is Connect, Chat, Make a Note, Add to Schedule and Request a Meeting. Play with these ahead of time.

### Planning Your Schedule

Web Summit's agenda is packed with talks, workshops, and networking sessions. Use the official app to plan your schedule, ensuring you don’t miss out on key sessions.

Take the time to research speakers and sessions ahead of the event. Knowing the backgrounds of key speakers can help you decide which talks are worth attending and prepare relevant questions.

All the big sessions are recorded, so don’t fear if something pops up and you don’t see the speaker you wanted. However, there is something very energizing about seeing someone in the flesh that you have admired and respected. For me it was to see Gary Vaynerchuck at the height of his powers. I won’t forget my [Gary Vee experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BDHQBXm_cA), he was on fire that day.

### Leverage Ecosystem Support Organizations

If your country has an official startup or international trade association (like 'Austrade' here in Australia), check to see if they have a presence at Web Summit and inquire about joining their activities.

Many of these organizations host their own events, so connecting with people from your country can be beneficial, especially as you'll share the Web Summit experience together.

### Announce your Attendance

Before you head to Lisbon, let people know you’re going. Do this on LinkedIn, X, Facebook, even TikTok and YouTube if you have a following. When you have contacts, friends there, they help expand your coverage at the event.

### Targeted Your Outreach Beforehand

If there are certain people you want to meet, investors, customers, media partners etc, start your outreach to them now. By the time the event has started, most in-demand people will have a full schedule. 

Go through the speaker list and also the attendee list using the search feature.

When doing outreach to get a meeting, here are my tips:

- **Personalize the approach** - E.g. "I notice you have invested in Fintech before".
- **Include the why** - tell them why you want to meet them.
- **Use multiple channels** - Use the app, LinkedIn, email, and social. It shows you really want to meet them (this really works!!).

## Navigating Web Summit

### Registration

Getting your badge on either the first night, or morning of the first day can take time due to the sheer number of attendees.

However, the airport has a registration tent, which usually has no queues, and you can collect your badge right there, and you’re done!! 

When leaving the airport in Lisbon, look to the right and you should see it. There will be signs directing you to Web Summit registration.

### Getting There

The Lisbon Metro is the BEST transport to the Web Summit venue. There are plenty of Ubers but the traffic can be terrible. The station to alight is called “Oriente” and is on the Red line. Cost is around €3.60 per day. Simply tap any recognised bank debit/credit card at the gates.

In the morning I grab an inexpensive coffee and a Portuguese tart (Pastel de nata) and jump on the Red line that goes straight to the venue.

### Opening Night

Opening night is massive, the arena is large but it will be closed off once full and you’ll be left to watch on screens outside. If you are going to do opening night, get there early. But I’d say only go if the lineup that night is unmissable for you.

### Getting to know the Venue Layout

Familiarize yourself with the venue map. Key areas include the main stage, exhibition halls, and networking zones. Knowing where these are will save you time and stress. But here’s the main things to know.

Web Summit has one arena, five pavilions, plus a load of bespoke smaller spaces.

The official Web Summit app and on-site maps are invaluable for getting around. Signage throughout the venue will also guide you to the right places. You will walk a lot, so a plan will help.

- Allow at least 5–10 minutes to travel between talks at different stages.
- Arrive 10–15 minutes early for Masterclass sessions, as seating is limited and filled on a first-come, first-served basis.

### Walk the Startup Alleys

Visit the ALPHA and BETA booths daily as they rotate, and take photos of the signs of companies you're interested in as you may not always be able to get to talk to everyone. It's exciting to discover other companies at a similar stage addressing challenges you might also be facing or solving similar problems.

### Effective Networking Strategies

Approach networking with a plan. Be ready to introduce yourself and engage in meaningful conversations. Listen actively and show genuine interest in others' work.

Use your elevator pitch so you get the point and don’t waste your time or others.

Connect with people. Ask a connection to confirm your Web Summit app connection request directly after scanning their badge (because you will only be able to export confirmed connections).

Do introductions for others. "Hey I’m not the right person for you, but Casey Lau would be super interested in meeting you." As Casey is a good guy, he will likely return the favor.

**Take Notes for Follow Up**

You’ve just had a great conversation and you think *"I won’t forget what that was about"*. After a full week, you will.

Use the official apps “Add a Note” feature to make sure you remember the details of that great conversation.

At the conference, everyone's badge will have a QR code that links to their profile when scanned with the official app, so make sure yours has a photo, X.com username and other important information that people you meet can use to connect with you.

Write down the context of the conversation and any action items. Write it all down. Maybe they are LA Lakers fans. You’d be surprised how well little things like a “Go Lakers” at the end of a follow up email would be received.

### Attending Sessions

Stages will fill up, especially for the high-profile speakers so get there early to ensure a seat. Try not to float from stage to stage, you will learn more if you watch a whole session, listen, focus and take notes.

### Engaging with Speakers and Panels

Participate in Q&A sessions if possible. Don’t hesitate to approach speakers after their talks; this can be a great way to make a connection.

### Food

There’s a ton of great food trucks which can be found between the MEO Arena and the halls, and also between the halls themselves.

Best tip is have an early lunch as you don’t want to waste your valuable Web Summit time, standing in a queue.

### Managing Time and Avoiding Burnout

Web Summit can be overwhelming. Schedule breaks, hydrate, and take time to relax to avoid burnout. Remember, it’s a marathon not a sprint.

As an introvert, I take regular breaks in the spaces between the halls.

### Exhibiting as a Startup in ALPHA or BETA

If You’re exhibiting as a startup, here’s my tips.

- The booth space is fairly small and can feel crowded, so identify nearby landmarks to help visitors find you.
- Consider bringing a second monitor, a tablecloth for your booth, or other decorative items to make your setup stand out.
- If you're running a specific promotion or offer, set up a quick contact form that prospects can fill out directly at the booth, otherwise you can use the app to scan prospects.
- Swag is popular but avoid "gimmicky" items that will quickly end up in landfill.

### Pitching your Startup on the PITCH Stage

The PITCH competition is a standard 3 + 3 format. That’s 3 minutes pitching plus 3 minutes of questions. As co-host and also a judge for many years, here are my best tips.

**Stay on Time, do not go over**

When I have hosted PITCH, if you went over, I’d simply remove that time from your questions. Not all hosts will do this. Some will cut you off mid-sentence not long after the 3 minute mark. There’s a countdown timer on screens in front of the stage you will be able to see.

**Prepare for the Questions**

Prepare as much for the questions as you prepare for the pitch. A series of great succinct answers will help your chances a lot.

### Engaging with Startups and Companies

When engaging with startups, consider how their innovations could impact your industry. Look for potential collaborations or investment opportunities.

Don’t sell to booth owners, they have paid good money and they are selling *their* stuff. Sure, drop by and say hi and drop a card, but don’t abuse their time.

### Identifying Trends and Innovations

Pay attention to recurring themes and emerging trends. These insights can provide a competitive edge in your work or business.

At the 2022 Web Summit, there were a lot of mumbles about the future of AI. It wasn’t loud but it was there and recurring.

ChatGPT launched about 2 weeks later. The 2023 Summit was all about AI.

### Approaching the Media

We asked Mike Butcher, Techcrunch Editor-at-Large and Web Summit veteran for his tips on engaging with the media. Here they are:

1. Ping your journalist before the event with an email/contact to set-up a meeting or offer them a story exclusive so the story comes out whilst you are there.

2. Scour the agenda to see where a journalist is moderating a panel or doing an interview. Try and grab them as they leave the stage.

3. "Goal hang" where the media enter the main venue from the VIP/Press area.

4. Repeat steps 2 & 3

Make sure you follow Mike - @mikebutcher and check out [The Europas Awards](https://www.theeuropas.com/), an event he created which runs during Web Summit.

## Making the Most of Social Events and Parties

### Side Events

As happens with most events of such a size, there are a ton of non-official but amazing side events every night (and some early morning ones too). Some of these events are extremely niche but you just might find your tribe there.

Luma published a list of them [here](https://lu.ma/websummit) last year, but keep an eye on Meetup and Eventbrite too.

Side events tend to fill up super quickly as people tend to register for everything, and choose what they attend closer to the time. Most experienced side event organizers know this, so if there’s a waitlist, join it. You’ll probably get in.

The larger "official" parties will be overrun so go for the smaller, themed events that are in your area of interest. This will allow you to find people that are potential valuable connections.

### Night Summit

The Night Summit events put on as part of Web Summit are a heap of fun. Each night hosted in different regions of the city, they are a heaving buzz of energy and excitement. The opportunity to meet with entrepreneurs from all over the globe is amazing, but don’t expect to meet that perfect partner or investor here. There are too many people and it’s too random.

![A picture of the Night Summit.](/img/blogs/fusionauth-web-summit/night-summit-wide.png)

### Tips for Social Events

Social events are an excellent opportunity to network in a more relaxed setting.

Wear your Web Summit badge all the time. I once connected with some people that saw I was from SendGrid whilst sitting by myself at a restaurant. I ended up joining their table and met an amazing group of people.

**Don't Drink Too Much**

You won’t be at your best and it will make the next day very long, trust me ;).

**Don’t Just Sell**

Ask people what they are working on. Trust me. 

Great results come from listening to people.

**Stay Humble and Thankful**

E.g. “It was great meeting you, and good luck with your venture.”

While it’s tempting to attend every social event, ensure you’re not compromising your productivity. Strike a balance between work and leisure to get the most out of the experience.

## Using Social Media Effectively

Share your experiences on social media using event hashtags and official Web Summit accounts. Engage with other attendees online (on socials and in the app) to expand your network. Tag people with accounts and hashtags or any people featured in your posts.

### Official Web Summit Accounts to Tag

X.com - [https://x.com/WebSummit](https://x.com/WebSummit)

Instagram - [https://www.instagram.com/websummit/](https://www.instagram.com/websummit/)

LinkedIn - [https://www.linkedin.com/company/web-summit/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/web-summit/)

TikTok - [https://www.tiktok.com/@websummit](https://www.tiktok.com/@websummit)

YouTube - [https://www.youtube.com/@websummit](https://www.youtube.com/@websummit)

### Hashtags

Hashtags to be used are as follows:

#websummit #websummit2024 #websummitlisbon

**Use Shorts**

Instagram Reels, TikTok, YouTube Shorts and LinkedIn Shorts (if they are available to you) are well worth posting. You’re a great chance to be shared by the official Web Summit account, and who knows what investor, partner or customer might see it.

***“Document. Don’t create”*** - Gary Vaynerchuck

Here’s a [great article from Gary Vee](https://garyvaynerchuk.com/creating-content-that-builds-your-personal-brand/) about approaching social media.

Even if you don’t post regularly, you can post a reel after the event documenting your experience. [Here’s one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2UGhmxvcbU) I did a few years ago.

### Video Interviews

If you come across a great customer or partner, take a few minutes to interview them. You will need a good mic as it’s noisy. Whilst your phone’s camera will be good enough, the mic will not and would leave the footage unusable.

### Things to do in Lisbon

Lisbon is one of the great cities of Europe. Here’s my must do list:

**Belém** - by the seaside with the best Pastéis ever!! 

**Bairro Alto** - fun neighborhood cobblestone alleys of bars and restaurants

**Time Out Market** - amazing food court showcasing the best of Lisbon. Doubles an unofficial startup hub during Web Summit

## Post-Event Actions

### Reviewing and Organizing Notes

After the event, review and organize your notes. Highlight key takeaways and action items to implement what you’ve learned.

### Following Up with Contacts

Firstly, download a CSV of all your team’s connections from the Web Summit app, then follow up regularly by adding them to your CRM, like Hubspot or a similar tool.

Send follow-up emails or LinkedIn messages to maintain the connections you made. Personalize each message using the notes you took to strengthen your new relationships.

E.g.

*Hey Mike,*

*I really enjoyed our chat about how refugees make great founders!!*

### Implementing Learnings

Apply the insights and knowledge gained at Web Summit to your projects or business. Consider sharing your learnings internally with your team or externally through social media, a video or blog post. This not only helps solidify your learnings but also builds your personal brand.

## Conclusion

### Recap of Key Points

Preparation is key to making the most of Web Summit. From planning your schedule to networking effectively, this guide has hopefully provided you with the tools to navigate the event successfully.

### Final Encouragement

Web Summit is a unique opportunity to learn, grow, and connect. Approach it with enthusiasm and an open mind, and you’ll leave with valuable experiences and insights.

Have fun, but it’s not a party. You can do that when you get home after landing a big deal :)
