If you've been working with FusionAuth, especially with the customizable features like themes and email messages, you might have wondered: "Is there an easier way to handle everyday operational tasks?"

Well, wonder no more! Let me introduce you to the FusionAuth command line interface (CLI). It can help you with scripting, automation, and general FusionAuth operational tasks.

## Wait, What Even Is The FusionAuth CLI?

Before we dive in, let's clear up some confusion. The FusionAuth CLI is **not** the same as:

- [The TypeScript client library](/docs/sdks/typescript), which is for low-level 1:1 API access, and used when you are managing FusionAuth configuration at scale.
- The [React](/docs/sdks/react-sdk), [Angular](/docs/sdks/angular-sdk), or [Vue SDKs](/docs/sdks/vue-sdk), which are for integrating authentication into your frontend SPA apps.

Think of the FusionAuth CLI as the AWS CLI for FusionAuth. It's built for developers and DevOps teams who want to script common tasks, automate workflows, and make their lives easier during development and CI/CD pipelines.

## What Can The CLI Actually Do?

The FusionAuth CLI has been around for a couple of years now, and while it doesn't offer access to every single FusionAuth API, it does some pretty cool things, including theme management, email template management and more.

### Theme Management Made Easy

With the CLI, you can download and upload themes with a few simple commands. No more clicking through the admin UI when you want to version control, edit or update, your beautiful login pages.

The CLI is used by the [FusionAuth Theme Helper project](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-theme-helper/) and pairs nicely with the [theme history repo](https://github.com/fusionAuth/fusionauth-theme-history) to help you apply changes to your theme customizations as the hosted login pages improve.

### Messages and Email Templates

Recently, we added the ability to manage messages alongside email templates. Huge shoutout to [Drilon Ibrahimi](https://github.com/drilonibrahimi), an amazing community member who contributed to this feature!

For each of these, you can manage not just the default message, but multiple localized versions. This makes it easy to manage localized messages in a separate repository and then load up your FusionAuth instance with the latest text whenever it changes. 

### User Import Testing

Need to test how FusionAuth handles 100,000 users? A million? 10 million?

The CLI now includes a fake user data generator powered by the [Faker package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@faker-js/faker).

It creates realistic-looking users, including data like names, email addresses, and birthdays. You can also register the users to a given application or add them to a group. 

All of this lets you stress-test your import process without using creative email addresses like `testNNN@example.com`.

### The Configuration Sanity Check

The CLI includes a common configuration check. Think of it as a pre-flight checklist based on documented best practices and [essential tasks](/docs/get-started/run-in-the-cloud/common-configuration). These tasks should be completed whenever you spin up an instance used by real users, but definitely before you go live.

## Get Started

Ready to give the CLI a spin? You can find the FusionAuth CLI on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fusionauth/cli), and the [technical documentation is also available](https://fusionauth.io/docs/customize/cli).

Feeling adventurous and want to contribute? We'd love to see you over at the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-node-cli). Pull requests welcome, stars appreciated, and good vibes guaranteed.

Happy scripting!
