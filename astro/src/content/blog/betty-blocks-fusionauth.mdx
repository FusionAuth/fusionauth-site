The company was founded by Chris Obdam and his brother Tim when they recognized a gap in the market. While running a custom software development business, they noticed that non-developers needed a way to make changes to software without always requiring technical expertise. This inspired them to create [Betty Blocks](https://www.bettyblocks.com/), which has since evolved into an enterprise-grade low-code platform used by thousands of customers globally.

## The Challenges
For Betty Blocks, authentication presented a dual challenge:

1. Platform Authentication: Users needed to securely log into the Betty Blocks development platform
2. Application Authentication: The applications built on Betty Blocks required their own authentication systems

As a company committed to making software development accessible and easy, Betty Blocks needed an authentication solution that would:

- Provide enterprise-grade security
- Offer flexibility and extensive feature support
- Support both [on-premises](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/) and [cloud](/docs/get-started/run-in-the-cloud/) deployments
- Integrate seamlessly with existing [identity providers](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/identity-providers/)
- Scale to thousands of applications
- Maintain high performance at scale
- Align with their open, flexible business model

## Why FusionAuth?

![Why FusionAuth?](/img/blogs/betty-blocks/betty-blocks-why-fusionauth.png)

After evaluating numerous authentication providers, Betty Blocks selected FusionAuth for several key reasons:

### 1. Unified, Simple Architecture

Unlike competitors that offered "patchwork" solutions cobbled together from different products, FusionAuth provided a clean, unified architecture:

> "The simplicity of the architecture is something that really stands out. Other products are a patchwork…while Fusion is just one product with a very basic architecture which really does the job right."

### 2. Open and Flexible Model

FusionAuth's hybrid nature and flexible deployment options perfectly aligned with Betty Blocks' values:

> "Having an open nature…provides a lot of possibilities and flexibility. A lot of people are okay with paying for software as long as they know that there's a good way out as well. And I think that is part of the open nature of FusionAuth, that there's flexibility there."

### 3. No "[Identity Provider Tax](/blog/idp-tax)"

Unlike competitors who charge extra fees for connecting to identity providers, FusionAuth's model made more sense to Betty Blocks:

> "The open nature of FusionAuth is something we like because we can connect to different identity providers and there's no charge for that, which doesn't make sense to us because it sounds like a very normal feature to have."

### 4. Developer-First Approach

Betty Blocks appreciated FusionAuth's product-first philosophy:

> "I'd rather choose a platform where the product goes first, and a good product always leads to paying for that as well."

### 5. Ease of Use and Implementation

FusionAuth's intuitive design and straightforward setup process stood out:

> "Everything speaks for itself and it's really straightforward and it is as you expect it to be, and that is not true with every product."

## The Implementation

![The Betty Blocks Architecture](/img/blogs/betty-blocks/betty-blocks-architecture.png)

Betty Blocks implemented FusionAuth to support their two main authentication pathways:

1. Basic Authentication: A simple username/password setup stored in an encrypted database
2. Enterprise Authentication: Integration with customers' existing identity providers

FusionAuth enabled Betty Blocks to offer both options in a low-code way, requiring only configuration without any coding necessary. This perfectly aligned with their low-code methods.

## Results at Scale

Betty Blocks has successfully scaled their implementation to remarkable levels:

- 10,000+ applications using FusionAuth through the Betty Blocks platform
- Each application serving between 100 to 10,000 users
- Users authenticating daily through the system

Despite this enormous scale, FusionAuth's still performs flawlessly:

> "...if you're a bigger company, you might have 10-20 applications using FusionAuth, but with us, it goes into the multiple thousands of applications running on a very small amount of FusionAuth servers. You can use it at a really big scale and continue to be performant as well."

## The Future

Betty Blocks continues to grow as a recognized player in the low-code space, having been featured in [Gartner Magic Quadrants](https://blog.bettyblocks.com/betty-blocks-named-a-visionary-in-2020-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-enterprise-low-code-application-platforms) and [Forrester Wave](https://www.bettyblocks.com/forrester-wave-low-code-2021) reports. As they execute on their strategy of providing even greater flexibility to customers, FusionAuth remains a key part of their plans:

> "We are working on the next step of our own open strategy, and that means that we will provide more flexibility to our customers, and also more flexibility in terms of authentication. FusionAuth will be really important in that first step."

As new authentication features like [passkeys](/tech-papers/why-passkeys-improve-user-security-how-to-implement-them) emerge, Betty Blocks appreciates how easily they can offer these innovations to their customers through FusionAuth:

> "Recently passkey and other features that are popping up have been a joy for us to use because it's just as simple as configuring it in FusionAuth, and now we can offer it to our customers."
