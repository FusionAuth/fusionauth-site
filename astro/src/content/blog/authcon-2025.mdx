Calling all developers passionate about authentication, identity, and CIAM -- this one's for you.  [AuthCon 2025](https://www.authcon.io/) is the first-ever conference dedicated to Customer Identity and Access Management, and it's built for developers. Taking place May 14-15, 2025 in New York City (coinciding with [apidays NYC](https://www.apidays.global/new-york/)), AuthCon is a community-driven event laser-focused on the auth challenges you tackle every day. If you're building applications and obsessed with login, user security, and great user experiences, here are the top five reasons you won't want to miss AuthCon 2025:

## 1. Connect with a Passionate Developer Community

AuthCon isn't a stuffy corporate tradeshow -- it's a community-driven gathering of developers and engineers who "get it." The event is intentionally kept small and intimate, creating the perfect environment for real conversations and meaningful networking. You'll be swapping war stories and solutions with peers who face the same CIAM challenges as you do. Whether you're debugging an OAuth flow or debating the merits of JWTs, you'll find folks here who speak your language and are eager to share what they've learned. It's a chance to build relationships with people as passionate about auth and identity as you are (minus the sales pitches and vendor booths).

## 2. Sessions Covering the Hottest Identity Trends

The agenda at AuthCon 2025 is stacked with talks on cutting-edge topics in authentication and identity. Want to boost MFA adoption and even go passwordless? Curious how browser standards (like WebAuthn and its implementation with passkeys) will reshape login flows? Ready to dive into the pain (and payoff) of CIAM migrations or hear about real homegrown auth wins and fails? It's all on the table. You'll even explore where blockchain might fit into future identity systems. These sessions aren't high-level fluff -- they're led by industry practitioners from companies like GitHub, GitLab, Arm, and IDPro who are deep in the trenches. Expect practical insights, emerging best practices, and plenty of forward-looking ideas to take back to your own projects.

## 3. Real-World Lessons from the Trenches

One of the best parts of AuthCon is learning how other developers have tackled the exact problems you're working on. You'll hear real-world case studies and candid lessons learned -- the good, the bad, and the ugly. Ever wonder how GitHub rolled out mandatory 2FA to millions of users without chaos, or how a team decided whether to build or buy their authentication system? AuthCon's speakers will share stories like these, complete with hard-earned takeaways. These aren't theoretical talks; they're honest discussions of what worked, what didn't, and what you can learn from it. By the end of the conference, you'll have a toolkit of proven approaches (and pitfalls to avoid) for improving your own app's identity and security. Plus, all those coffee-break conversations and hallway chats with fellow attendees will spark new ideas and solutions for your projects.

## 4. FusionAuth Genius Bar -- 1:1 Expert Support

Have burning questions about FusionAuth or authentication architecture in general? At AuthCon 2025, you'll have direct access to FusionAuth's team of experts through our very own Genius Bar. This is your chance to get one-on-one guidance from the engineers and support gurus behind FusionAuth. Bring your toughest questions -- whether it's tweaking your OAuth configuration, planning a migration, or just looking for best practices -- and get answers in real time. Already using FusionAuth in production? Swing by to troubleshoot any issues or learn tips and tricks straight from the source. Even if you're not a customer, the expert advice on authentication design and strategy is invaluable. It's like having a free consulting session with the people who live and breathe customer identity. You'll walk away with new solutions to implement and a direct line to the FusionAuth community.

## 5. Two Events, One Ticket: Free apidays NYC Included

Here's an extra perk: your AuthCon 2025 registration includes free admission to apidays New York! That's right -- you get two conferences for the price of one. Apidays is a leading API-focused conference, and with an AuthCon ticket you'll have full access to all of its sessions, workshops, and networking events as well. It's a fantastic opportunity to broaden your learning beyond identity and dive into the latest in APIs, microservices, and developer tools, all during the same trip. Whether you want to explore new API design trends or understand how identity ties into the API economy, apidays has you covered. Essentially, you'll spend two days supercharging your skills: one day deep in CIAM at AuthCon and another immersing yourself in the wider world of APIs -- an ideal combo for any modern application developer.

Ready to level up your authentication game? AuthCon 2025 is around the corner, and it's shaping up to be an event no auth-focused developer should miss. You'll leave inspired, informed, and equipped with new connections and knowledge to drive your projects forward. Join us in NYC on May 14-15 and be part of the first conference devoted entirely to the customer identity community.
