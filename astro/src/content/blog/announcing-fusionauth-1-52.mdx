We know that the digital world is a safer place when more companies adopt strong login and authentication practices. We also know that 10 million plus FusionAuth downloads means that we've already made an impact. 

But what if we could do more? What if we gave [passkeys](/guides/what-is-a-passkey) to...everyone? Sure, it means that we're giving away a high-value feature for free, but it also means that people and data are going to be safer.

So, with that in mind, we have dubbed [FusionAuth v 1.52.0](/download) "The Passkey Platypus." After all, we too are highly opinionated, and it’s our opinion that including passkeys as a feature of our free Community plan is a good idea. For those of you who want to read all of the fine print, you’ll get that in our [release notes](/docs/release-notes/).

If you’re already using the Community plan, you’ll need to upgrade to 1.52.0 to get passkeys. Regardless of whether you’re a new or existing user, you’ll need to register for a free license of FusionAuth. Our Admin UI will walk you through the process. Your free license is good forever, and will remain active as we add even more features to the Community plan over time. 

Okay, chances are good that someone reading this is asking "why should I care about passkeys?" The answer? [24 billion compromised passwords](/blog/why-passkeys-matter) in a single year. The era of passwords is [coming to an end](/password-history). Passkeys offer a more secure, passwordless authentication method that reduces the risk of breaches while improving the experience for your customers.

We're committed to helping you provide safer, more secure (and dare we say pleasant?) login experiences. By making passkeys available to every FusionAuth user, we're taking another step toward eliminating the risks of traditional passwords. 

So, what are you waiting for? [Download](/download) FusionAuth or upgrade to version 1.52.0 to provide your users with a superior login experience. Activating passkeys is simple—just toggle the switch in the FusionAuth UI.
