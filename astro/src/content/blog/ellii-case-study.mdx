- **Learning Management System (LMS) Integration**: The ability for authentication systems to connect seamlessly with educational platforms like Canvas, Blackboard, or Google Classroom, enabling single sign-on experiences for students and teachers
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: A authentication method allowing users to access multiple educational applications with one set of credentials, crucial for reducing friction in classroom technology adoption and improving user experience
- **Data Residency**: The practice of storing and processing data within specific geographic boundaries, critical for EdTech companies to comply with international education privacy regulations like FERPA, COPPA, and GDPR
- **Educational Technology (EdTech) Authentication**: Specialized identity management designed for educational environments, addressing unique requirements like student privacy protection, teacher-student role management, and institutional compliance needs

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How does FusionAuth handle both B2B and B2C identity requirements for educational platforms?**

A: FusionAuth's flexible architecture supports both institutional B2B authentication (integrating with school systems and LMS platforms) and direct B2C authentication (individual teachers and students creating accounts). This dual capability allows EdTech companies like Ellii to serve both institutional customers and individual users through a single, unified authentication system.

**Q: Can FusionAuth be deployed using Docker or Kubernetes for educational technology platforms?**

A: Yes, FusionAuth supports containerized deployments through Docker and Kubernetes, making it ideal for EdTech platforms that need scalable, cloud-native infrastructure. This deployment flexibility allows educational technology companies to maintain consistent environments across development, staging, and production while supporting the high availability requirements of global learning platforms.

**Q: How does FusionAuth's single-tenant architecture enhance security for educational applications?**

A: FusionAuth's single-tenant architecture ensures that each educational institution's data remains completely isolated, with no shared infrastructure between different schools or EdTech customers. This isolation is crucial for protecting sensitive student data and meeting strict educational privacy regulations like FERPA and COPPA that govern how student information must be handled and stored.

**Q: How can developers integrate modern authentication protocols like OAuth2 and OIDC with educational systems?**

A: FusionAuth provides comprehensive OAuth2 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) support specifically designed for educational environments. The platform includes detailed documentation for integrating with popular educational systems, pre-built connectors for major LMS platforms, and flexible configuration options that accommodate the diverse authentication requirements of different educational institutions and learning management systems.

**Q: How does FusionAuth support regulatory compliance and privacy for educational technology companies?**

A: FusionAuth addresses educational compliance through multiple layers: data residency controls allowing EdTech companies to choose where student data is stored, comprehensive audit logs for compliance reporting, FERPA-compliant data handling practices, and built-in privacy controls that help educational platforms meet COPPA requirements for protecting children's online privacy in learning environments.

## The Challenge

As an EdTech company serving teachers, students, and administrators globally, Ellii faced significant authentication challenges that were impacting their ability to scale and innovate:

**Growing Security Requirements**: The education technology landscape demands enterprise-grade security features, including [multi-factor authentication](/articles/authentication/multi-factor-authentication), which would require substantial development resources to build and maintain in-house.

**Integration Complexity**: Ellii needed to integrate with various Learning Management Systems (LMS) and school systems, requiring flexible authentication methods to support diverse institutional requirements.

**Resource Allocation**: As a focused team, Ellii wanted to concentrate their development efforts on what they do best—building innovative educational tools—rather than spending time on authentication infrastructure.

**Maintenance Burden**: Their existing Ruby on Rails authentication solution via Devise was becoming increasingly complex to maintain as security requirements evolved and best practices changed rapidly.

For Ellii, the authentication system needed to:

- Provide advanced security features without extensive development overhead
- Support seamless integration with external educational systems
- Enable secure, intuitive access for diverse user types (teachers, students, administrators)
- Offer flexible deployment options to meet data residency requirements
- Scale reliably as their global user base continued to grow

## Why FusionAuth?

After evaluating various authentication solutions, Ellii selected FusionAuth for several compelling reasons:

### 1\. Enterprise-Grade Security Made Simple

FusionAuth provided the advanced security features Ellii needed—including multi-factor authentication—without requiring them to build and maintain complex security infrastructure in-house.
