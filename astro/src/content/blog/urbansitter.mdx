UrbanSitter's voyage into B2B meant that they needed to add SSO and MFA without taking time away from their internal development teams.

## The Problem

UrbanSitter is a company that connects families with babysitters. As they have grown, UrbanSitter has started offering their service to other companies as a perk for employees. This new B2B expansion meant they needed better security for their system. Their B2B customer required features like single [sign-on (SSO)](/articles/authentication/how-sso-works) and [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](/blog/understanding-multifactor-authentication-mfa).

The UrbanSitter's home-grown auth couldn't keep up with these new needs. It worked fine for everyday use, but it wasn't flexible enough for their new B2B customers. These companies had strict security rules that UrbanSitter's DIY authentication system couldn't meet.

Building a whole new system from scratch would have taken too much time and pulled their developers away from their main job. UrbanSitter's main goal is connecting families with childcare, not building complex login systems. They needed a solution that was reliable, secure, and would work well with their current setup.

## The Solution

After looking at several options, UrbanSitter chose FusionAuth to solve their problem. FusionAuth offered what they needed without requiring too much work from their team. It could handle the tough security demands of their business customers without stretching UrbanSitter's resources too thin.

FusionAuth was a good fit because it could easily work with UrbanSitter's current system which ran on Kubernetes on Google Cloud. It also offered advanced features like SSO and MFA that their business clients wanted. Another big plus was that UrbanSitter could [host FusionAuth themselves](/platform/self-hosting) instead of being in a shared environment. This flexibility meant that they kept control over sensitive data about families and sitters.

Lucas Whitman, UrbanSitter's Chief Technology Officer, explained why FusionAuth's flexibility was so important:

>"FusionAuth let us add SSO for clients without changing how we work or disrupting our processes. Being able to host it ourselves was crucial for managing sensitive family and sitter data."

The switch to FusionAuth didn't take long. Whitman shared, "The whole migration process took about a week. That includes setting up the self-hosting and all the integration and testing." [Bulk Migration](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/) allowed UrbanSitter to move their existing users over without any breaks in service.

## The Results

After switching to FusionAuth, UrbanSitter saw big improvements in how efficiently they work. They can now quickly set up SSO for their partners. This means users can easily move between UrbanSitter's platform and partner websites without logging in multiple times.

One of the best parts for UrbanSitter is how little work FusionAuth needs. Whitman said, "We rarely have to do anything with FusionAuth. It just works in the background, which is exactly what you want with a login system." He also pointed out how reliable it is, saying, "If FusionAuth goes down, our whole system will go down. So the fact that it's so reliable is impressive and makes me very happy."

Using FusionAuth has allowed UrbanSitter to grow its B2B services with confidence. Whitman explained, "We have partners that have integrated with our FusionAuth instances as their primary point of authentication. We're...sharing that auth and becoming...a hub for authorization in the space."

UrbanSitter especially appreciates how FusionAuth stays ahead of security issues. Whitman noted: 

>"From what I see from the FusionAuth team, like posts from Daniel and Brian, they're very proactive about security. They don't just react to problems, they try to prevent them. That's a big reason why we chose them."

Looking to the future, Whitman is excited about how much more they can do with FusionAuth. He said, "We're just scratching the surface with FusionAuth. There's so much more we can grow into and so many more options for us to expand our login capabilities."

For the UrbanSitter team, one of the biggest benefits has been peace of mind. They don't have to worry about keeping up with the latest security standards or fixing login problems. FusionAuth takes care of all that, letting the UrbanSitter developers focus on improving their core service.

The success UrbanSitter has had with FusionAuth shows how important it is for growing companies to choose the right tools. By picking a solution that fit their needs and could grow with them, UrbanSitter set themselves up for success. They solved their immediate problem of needing better security for business clients, but they also gave themselves room to expand in the future.

As more companies look to offer perks like UrbanSitter to their employees, having a robust, flexible login system will be crucial. UrbanSitter is now well-positioned to take advantage of this trend, thanks to their smart choice of FusionAuth for handling their authentication needs.
