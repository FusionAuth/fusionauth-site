FusionAuth is excited to be attending and sponsoring the Kansas City Developers Conference! This year's event (the 14th annual!) will take place June 21-June 23 at the Kansas City Convention Center, with the bulk of the content happening on Jun 22 and June 23.

KCDC brings together developers, software engineers, UX designers, product managers, entrepreneurs, and more for a unique opportunity to network and learn from each other. It's community driven and while they accept corporate sponsors, it has that community feel.

As far as content goes, there are more than 180 technical sessions covering topics from architecture to cloud to JavaScript to human skills to security and UI/UX design. Whew!

FusionAuth team member Dan Moore will be giving a few talks (see more below), but other interesting sessions include:

* **The Infrastructure is Reliable and Other Folk Tales** by Tom Wheeler
* **How to Talk to Women** by Diana Pham
* **React: The Most Common Mistakes in 2023** by Cory House

And there are [plenty more](https://www.kcdc.info/sessions).

## Meet up with FusionAuth

If you want to meet with the FusionAuth team at KCDC, weâ€™re around and ready to chat. Or at least available to tell you a Chuck Norris joke.
