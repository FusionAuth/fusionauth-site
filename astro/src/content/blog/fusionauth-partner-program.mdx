FusionAuth, the only dev-first, downloadable Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) solution, announced the launch of a Partner Program to support a [growing demand](/blog/fusionauth-momentum-2024) for authentication with a hybrid deployment model. The program features some of the industry's most trusted names, including AWS and Google. When authentication initiatives require assistance around implementation, ongoing maintenance, architecture design, or even cost optimization, the FusionAuth Partner Program has a partner to help.

The FusionAuth Partner Program offers a network of leading hyperscalers, systems integrators (SIs), and technology providers to meet the needs of businesses of all sizes – whether they’re focused on hosting compatibility, seamless implementation, ongoing maintenance, or optimizing costs.

“At FusionAuth, we understand that identity is at the heart of the best digital experiences,” said Brian Pontarelli, CEO of FusionAuth. “Our new partner program provides tools for partners to simplify authentication by enabling local testing and native integration. Since FusionAuth can be downloaded and run on any computer, anywhere in the world, partners can simplify development processes and deliver better solutions, faster. Allowing partners to deploy FusionAuth in their customer’s environments can dramatically increase security as well. This program helps partners support their customers’ app modernization and security efforts while delivering faster development, improved security, and greater flexibility.”

Qasim Akhtar, CEO of Cloudelligent said, "At Cloudelligent, we know that time-to-market without sacrificing security is everything for our clients, and integrating authentication solutions can sometimes slow things down. Partnering with FusionAuth allows us to leverage robust tools and expert support to streamline implementations, cut deployment time, and deliver cost-effective solutions our customers can rely on."
