Engineering teams today face a common challenge: delivering reliable, secure login experiences while keeping up with the speed of product growth. Millions of logins, rising security requirements, and nonstop performance expectations can stretch homegrown or outdated systems past their limits.

FusionAuth and Google Cloud give teams a better way to manage identity. Together, they help organizations scale their access infrastructure as they grow, while keeping sensitive data protected. The result is faster time-to-deploy, simplified operations, and the flexibility to run authentication where and how teams need it.

## Flexible, developer-first identity management

FusionAuth is a developer-focused customer identity and access management (CIAM) platform that runs anywhere. FusionAuth’s single-tenant architecture ensures full data ownership and compliance, while its API-first design integrates directly into CI/CD pipelines to accelerate development and reduce operational overhead.

When deployed on Google Cloud, that flexibility becomes even more powerful. Teams can run FusionAuth on Managed Instance Groups for effortless scaling, integrate with Cloud SQL and Cloud Logging for visibility and monitoring, and use Google Cloud’s global infrastructure to maintain low latency for users everywhere. This combination helps engineering teams reduce manual maintenance and deploy updates confidently, even in high-traffic environments.

## How Bilt scaled securely on Google Cloud

[Bilt](/blog/bilt-fusionauth), the first loyalty program that lets members earn points on rent, needed an identity platform that could scale with a fast-growing user base. By running FusionAuth in its own Google Cloud environment, Bilt gained a secure, compliant CIAM solution that automatically scales during monthly login surges.
Today, millions of renters log in to Bilt quickly and securely, even during peak periods like the first of the month. With FusionAuth and Google Cloud, Bilt now has an identity foundation built to scale with whatever comes next.

## Building modern authentication on trusted infrastructure

Custom-built systems and rigid CIAM platforms can’t keep pace with modern workloads.Teams need infrastructure that combines compliance, cost efficiency, and performance at scale. FusionAuth and Google Cloud help organizations meet their evolving identity needs with access management built to scale with the business, not slow it down.
