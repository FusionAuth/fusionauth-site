In today's content-driven world, creators often need to share their videos across multiple platforms to maximize reach and engagement. However, managing separate accounts and authentication flows for each platform can be cumbersome. What if you could build an application that allows users to upload videos to both YouTube (Google) and Twitter with a single login? This is where FusionAuth's Identity Provider Links feature becomes invaluable.

Identity Provider (IDP) Links allow you to connect a FusionAuth user account with multiple social identity providers through access and refresh tokens, enabling your application to securely access APIs from different platforms while maintaining a single unified user account.

## What Are Identity Provider Links?

Identity Provider Links establish a relationship between a FusionAuth user and users in third-party identity providers such as Google and Twitter. When a link is created, FusionAuth stores information about the connection, including:

- The identity provider ID
- The user ID in the identity provider
- The FusionAuth user ID
- A display name (usually an email or username)
- A access or refresh token from the identity provider

## Preparation

Before we dive into the implementation, let's set up our environment. We'll need:

1. A running FusionAuth instance
2. Google and Twitter developer accounts with API access
3. A video upload application that connects to multiple services

### Setting Up FusionAuth

If you don't already have FusionAuth running, you can follow [Step-1](/docs/get-started/start-here/step-1) of the [Get Started Tutorial](/docs/get-started/start-here/).

Alternatively, you can check out our [example application on GitHub](https://github.com/sonderformat-llc/fusionauth-example-using-links-fastify) which includes a pre-defined Kickstart configuration. This example demonstrates how to use Identity Provider Links with Fastify, Google, and Twitter.

Once FusionAuth is running, we'll need to create an application:

1. Log in to the FusionAuth admin UI
2. Navigate to Applications → Add
3. Enter a name for your application (e.g., "Video Upload App")
4. On the OAuth tab, add a Redirect URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`)
5. Enable the Authorization Code grant
6. Save the application
7. Note the Client ID and Client Secret for later use

### Creating the Video Upload Application

For our demo, we'll create a Node.js application using Fastify that will:

1. Allow users to log in with FusionAuth
2. Connect to both Google (YouTube) and Twitter accounts
3. Upload videos to multiple platforms simultaneously

Let's start by setting up a new Fastify project:

```bash
# Create a new directory for your project
mkdir video-upload-app
cd video-upload-app

# Initialize a new Node.js project
npm init -y

# Install required dependencies
npm install fastify fastify-autoload fastify-static fastify-formbody fastify-multipart
npm install fastify-passport fastify-secure-session fastify-cookie ejs
npm install @fastify/view dotenv passport-oauth2 google-auth-library googleapis twitter-api-v2
```

Next, create an environment file (.env) with your configuration:

```
# FusionAuth Configuration
FUSIONAUTH_URL=http://localhost:9011
FUSIONAUTH_API_KEY=your-api-key
FUSIONAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
FUSIONAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
FUSIONAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/callback

# Google/YouTube Configuration
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
GOOGLE_PROVIDER_ID=your-google-provider-id-from-fusionauth

# Twitter Configuration
TWITTER_API_KEY=your-twitter-api-key
TWITTER_API_SECRET=your-twitter-api-secret
TWITTER_PROVIDER_ID=your-twitter-provider-id-from-fusionauth
```

The complete application structure is available in our [example repository](https://github.com/sonderformat-llc/fusionauth-example-using-links-fastify). We'll cover the key components in the following sections.

## Setting Up Identity Providers

Now, let's configure the identity providers we'll be using: Google and Twitter.

### Setting Up OpenID Connect for YouTube API Access

To set up YouTube API access in FusionAuth, we need to use the [OpenID Connect](/docs/apis/identity-providers/openid-connect) identity provider instead of the standard [Google](/docs/apis/identity-providers/google) identity provider.

<Aside type="caution">
The standard Google identity provider in FusionAuth stores an id_token in the identityProviderLink object that cannot be used for API access. For YouTube API integration, you must use the OpenID Connect identity provider configured for Google.
</Aside>

The key difference is that the OpenID Connect identity provider can be configured to request and store a refresh token, which can be exchanged for access tokens to make API calls to YouTube. Here's how to set it up:

#### Enabling the YouTube Data API

Before you can upload videos to YouTube, you need to enable the YouTube Data API in your Google Cloud project:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Navigate to APIs & Services → Library
4. Search for "YouTube Data API v3"
5. Click on the API and then click "Enable"

#### Creating an Application in Google Cloud

After enabling the YouTube Data API, you need to create an OAuth application in Google Cloud:

1. In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen
2. Select "External" as the user type (unless you have a Google Workspace)
3. Fill in the required information:
   - App name (e.g., "Video Upload App")
   - User support email
   - Developer contact information
4. Click "Save and Continue"
5. On the Scopes screen, add the following scopes:
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly`
6. Click "Save and Continue"
7. Add test users if you're not verifying your app
8. Click "Save and Continue" to complete the setup

#### Creating Google OAuth 2.0 Credentials with YouTube Scopes

Now you need to create OAuth 2.0 credentials that your application will use to authenticate with Google:

1. In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to APIs & Services → Credentials
2. Click "Create Credentials" and select "OAuth client ID"
3. Select "Web application" as the application type
4. Enter a name for your client (e.g., "Video Upload Client")
5. Add authorized JavaScript origins:
   - `http://localhost:3000` (for development)
6. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   - `http://localhost:9011/oauth2/callback` (for FusionAuth)
   - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` (for your application)
7. Click "Create"
8. Note the Client ID and Client Secret that are generated

When configuring scopes in the consent screen, make sure you've included the following for YouTube uploads:
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload` - Required for uploading videos
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube` - Full access to YouTube account
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly` - Read-only access for metrics
- `email profile openid` - Standard user information

#### Configuring the OpenID Connect Identity Provider for Google in FusionAuth

Now that you have your Google OAuth credentials, you need to configure an OpenID Connect identity provider in FusionAuth:

1. In FusionAuth, go to Settings → Identity Providers
2. Click "Add OpenID Connect"
3. Enter a name like "Google YouTube API"
4. Enter the Client ID and Client Secret from Google
5. Set the following endpoints:
   - Authorization endpoint: `https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth`
   - Token endpoint: `https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token`
   - Userinfo endpoint: `https://openidconnect.googleapis.com/v1/userinfo`
6. Set "Discover endpoints" to "No" since we're manually entering them
7. In the scope field, add: `email profile openid https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly`
8. Set the button text to "Login with Google for YouTube"
9. Select the applications that should use this identity provider
10. Save the configuration

This configuration will ensure that FusionAuth requests and stores a refresh token from Google, which can be used to make API calls to YouTube.

<Aside type="note">
For YouTube API access, you'll need to ensure your Google Cloud project has been verified by Google if you plan to publish your application. During development, you can test with unverified apps, but they have limitations on the number of users.
</Aside>

### Setting Up Twitter as an Identity Provider for Media Uploads

To set up Twitter as an identity provider with media upload capabilities, you'll need to create a Twitter developer account and configure the appropriate settings in both Twitter and FusionAuth. Follow these steps:

1. Create a Twitter developer account
2. Apply for Elevated access (required for media uploads)
3. Create a Twitter app with appropriate permissions
4. Configure the authentication settings
5. Create a Twitter Identity Provider in FusionAuth

For detailed instructions on the basic setup, refer to the [Twitter Identity Provider documentation](https://fusionauth.io/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/identity-providers/social/twitter).

Here's a detailed walkthrough for setting up Twitter media uploads:

#### Applying for Elevated Access

Twitter's standard API access doesn't allow for media uploads. You'll need to apply for Elevated access:

1. Go to the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com)
2. Navigate to the Projects & Apps section
3. Apply for Elevated access by clicking on "Apply for Elevated" 
4. Complete the application form, explaining your use case for media uploads
5. Wait for approval (this can take a few days)

#### Creating a Twitter App with Media Upload Permissions

Once you have Elevated access, you need to create a Twitter app with the appropriate permissions:

1. In the Twitter Developer Portal, create a new app or use an existing one
2. Under "App permissions", select "Read and Write" (required for media uploads)
3. Under "Authentication settings", enable "3-legged OAuth"
4. Add a callback URL: `http://localhost:9011/oauth2/callback` (for FusionAuth)
5. Enable "Request email from users"
6. Save the settings
7. Note the API Key and API Secret Key

#### Configuring the Twitter Identity Provider in FusionAuth

Now you need to configure the Twitter identity provider in FusionAuth:

1. In FusionAuth, go to Settings → Identity Providers
2. Click "Add Twitter"
3. Enter the Consumer Key (API Key) and Consumer Secret (API Secret Key) from your Twitter app
4. Configure the button text (e.g., "Login with Twitter")
5. Select the applications that should use this identity provider
6. Save the configuration

This will allow users to authenticate with Twitter and will store the access token and secret in the identity provider link, which can be used for media uploads.

<Aside type="caution">
Twitter has rate limits for media uploads. For production applications, you'll need to implement appropriate rate limiting and error handling to manage these constraints.
</Aside>

## Using Identity Provider Links

Now that we have our identity providers set up, let's explore how to use the Identity Provider Links API to connect social identities to a FusionAuth user account.

### Understanding Token Storage in Identity Provider Links

When working with Identity Provider Links for API access, it's crucial to understand how different identity providers store tokens in the `identityProviderLink` object. The token format varies depending on the identity provider:

<Aside type="caution">
The standard Google identity provider in FusionAuth stores an **id_token** in the identityProviderLink object. While this token is useful for authentication, it **cannot be used for API access** to Google services like YouTube.
</Aside>

In contrast, the OpenID Connect identity provider configured for Google stores a **refresh_token** in the identityProviderLink object. This refresh token can be exchanged for access tokens, which are required for API access to Google services.

This is why we use the OpenID Connect identity provider instead of the standard Google identity provider for our YouTube integration.

When implementing API access using Identity Provider Links, you need to:

1. Configure the appropriate identity provider (OpenID Connect for Google/YouTube)
2. Extract the token from the identityProviderLink object
3. For Google/YouTube, exchange the refresh token for an access token before making API calls
4. For Twitter, parse the token string to extract the access token and secret

The code examples in this tutorial demonstrate these patterns for both YouTube and Twitter integrations.

### Understanding the Links API

FusionAuth provides a comprehensive API for managing identity provider links. Here are the key endpoints you'll use in your application:

1. **Retrieve Links** - Get all identity provider links for a user
   ```
   GET /api/identity-provider/link?userId=<userId>
   ```

2. **Create a Link** - Link a user to an identity provider
   ```
   POST /api/identity-provider/link
   ```

3. **Delete a Link** - Remove a link between a user and an identity provider
   ```
   DELETE /api/identity-provider/link?identityProviderId=<identityProviderId>&identityProviderUserId=<identityProviderUserId>&userId=<userId>
   ```

In our Fastify application, we've implemented these API calls to enable the following functionality:

1. **Link a User**: Create a link between a FusionAuth user and a social identity
2. **Retrieve Links**: Get information about existing links to determine available upload platforms
3. **Unlink a User**: Remove a link between a FusionAuth user and a social identity

Let's look at how to use these endpoints in our application.

### Implementing Video Uploads with Identity Provider Links

Now, let's implement our video upload application with identity provider links using Fastify. We'll focus on the key components that handle the upload process and interact with the identity provider links.

First, let's look at the main application structure:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/src/app.ts"} lang="typescript"/>

Next, let's examine how we retrieve the user's identity provider links to determine which platforms they can upload to:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/src/env.ts"} lang="typescript"/>

Next, let's create the service files for interacting with YouTube and Twitter:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/src/links/youtube.ts"} lang="typescript"/>

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/src/links/twitter.ts"} lang="typescript"/>

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/src/fusionauth.ts"} lang="typescript"/>

Now, let's implement the routes for our application:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/src/routes/root.ts"} lang="typescript"/>

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/src/routes/auth.ts"} lang="typescript"/>

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/src/routes/links.ts"} lang="typescript"/>

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/src/routes/upload.ts"} lang="typescript"/>

Finally, let's implement the routes for linking new providers:

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/src/links/index.ts"} lang="typescript"/>

<RemoteCode url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/src/utils.ts"} lang="typescript"/>

### Testing the Implementation

To test our implementation, we'll run the example application and go through the process of linking accounts and uploading videos:

1. Clone the example repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sonderformat-llc/fusionauth-example-using-links-fastify
   cd fusionauth-example-using-links-fastify
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with your configuration (see the `.env.example` file for reference)

4. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

6. Log in with your FusionAuth credentials

7. On the dashboard, you'll see options to link your Google and Twitter accounts

8. Click on one of the link buttons and authenticate with the selected provider

9. After authentication, you'll be redirected back to the dashboard showing your linked accounts

10. Upload a video file by dragging and dropping or clicking the upload area

11. Select which platforms to post to (YouTube, Twitter, or both)

12. Click "Post" to upload the video to the selected platforms

13. View the results showing links to your uploaded content

The application demonstrates how Identity Provider Links enable you to maintain a single user account while connecting to and interacting with multiple social platforms.

## Conclusion

Identity Provider Links are a powerful feature of FusionAuth that enable you to build sophisticated multi-platform applications like our video uploader. By connecting multiple social identities to a single user account, you can provide a seamless experience for content creators who need to publish videos across different platforms.

In this tutorial, we've covered:

1. Setting up FusionAuth with Google and Twitter as identity providers with the necessary API access for video uploads
2. Understanding how Identity Provider Links store tokens that can be used for API access
3. Implementing a video upload application that publishes content to multiple platforms simultaneously
4. Testing the application to ensure proper functionality

The example application demonstrates several key concepts:

- **Single Sign-On with Multiple Providers**: Users can log in once with FusionAuth and access multiple platforms
- **Token Management**: The application securely stores and uses tokens for API access
- **Cross-Platform Publishing**: Videos can be uploaded to multiple platforms with a single action
- **User Experience**: The interface allows users to easily manage their connected accounts

By leveraging Identity Provider Links, you can create a unified video publishing experience that simplifies the workflow for content creators. Instead of manually uploading videos to each platform and managing separate accounts, users can publish once and reach audiences across multiple platforms.

This approach not only improves the user experience but also opens up possibilities for more advanced features like:

- Consolidated analytics dashboards showing performance across platforms
- Synchronized comment moderation across YouTube and Twitter
- Coordinated publishing schedules and content strategies
- Backup options if one platform experiences issues

The complete source code for this example is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sonderformat-llc/fusionauth-example-using-links-fastify), allowing you to explore the implementation details and adapt it to your own applications.
