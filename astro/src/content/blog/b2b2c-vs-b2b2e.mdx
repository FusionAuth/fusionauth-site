With software as a service (SaaS), you are often building not just for one set of users, but for multiple customers which may themselves have their own users.

{/* more */}

Examples include:

* A private labelled job board
* Diagramming software you sell to businesses for their employees to use
* An LLM chatbot for enterprises to use internally

This pattern is called business-to-business-to-consumer (B2B2C) or business-to-business-to-employee (B2B2E), but generalizes to business-to-business-to-user (B2B2U).

Let's dive in to learn more about these various patterns of application architecture, the ramifications for user modeling, and where they are similar and where they differ.

## What Is B2B2U

Business-to-Business-to-User (B2B2U) SaaS applications represent an architectural model where software companies build products that are sold to businesses who then provide those services to end users. 

The relevant players in any B2B2U system include:

* The SaaS business creating the software
* Two or more intermediate businesses that are customers of the SaaS business
* End users which use the software; they interact with one or more intermediate businesses but do not typically know about the SaaS business

Unlike traditional B2B SaaS where the purchaser and primary user are the same, B2B2U applications introduce complexity. Product success depends not just on meeting customer requirements, but also on delivering genuine value to the ultimate consumer.

These applications often emerge in sectors like:

* financial services
* healthcare
* enterprise productivity tools

A core platform needs to be flexible enough to be white-labeled or embedded by the intermediate businesses. The technical and product challenges are significant. You must build a solution that is simultaneously:

* full-featured enough for purchase
* customizable enough for business integration
* and seamless enough to provide an excellent end-user experience

## What Is B2B2C

This is a subset of B2B2U where the end user is a person who is a customer or potential customer of the intermediate business. In other words, the end user is paying or may pay the intermediate business.

Imagine a world where a bank offers a personal finance management tool developed by a third-party SaaS provider, or an e-commerce platform integrating a sophisticated recommendation engine. 

These applications are at the intersection of enterprise capability and consumer experience, requiring a balance of technical flexibility, compliance, and user-centric design. 

Businesses gain powerful tools to enhance their consumer offerings without building complex software from scratch, while SaaS providers access broader markets through established enterprise channels. Unlike traditional B2B or B2C models, B2B2C applications must satisfy two distinct yet interconnected customer segments:

* the business buyer 
* the end consumer

This makes the design and go-to-market strategy of such providers uniquely challenging.

A B2B2C model with an intermediate business offering a freemium product plays out differently when the intermediary sells directly to consumers. For example, consider a productivity software company that integrates an AI-powered writing assistant into its app. The software provider offers a free tier with basic AI suggestions. Meanwhile, the AI vendor operates in the background, powering the feature and benefiting from broad adoption without having to market directly to individual users. Monetization happens when the productivity app upgrades users to premium AI features.

This setup allows the intermediary to differentiate its product and improve retention while giving the AI provider a scalable distribution channel. The challenge is balancing what’s offered in the free tier—too much, and there’s no incentive to upgrade; too little, and the feature is a gimmick. Additionally, the AI provider must ensure seamless integration, availability, and performance, since its success depends on the productivity app’s ability to drive adoption and upsells.

## What Is B2B2E

This is a subset of B2B2U where the end user is a person who is an employee or contractor of the intermediate business. In other words, the end user is paid or otherwise compensated by the intermediate business.

These applications emerge at the critical intersection of corporate infrastructure and individual workplace needs, enabling companies to deploy tools to streamline workflows, improve communication, and drive organizational effectiveness.

Unlike direct enterprise software or B2B2C consumer-facing applications, B2B2E solutions must navigate the complex terrain of corporate procurement, IT security requirements, and individual user expectations. 

Examples of such software include:

* learning management systems sold to a multinational corporation
* employee engagement platforms that integrate into existing HR tech stacks

The value of these B2B2E applications lies in their ability to create value for both the purchasing organization and its workforce, balancing institutional goals with individual user experience in a delicate technological dance.

## How Are B2B2E And B2B2C Similar?

B2B2C and B2B2E platforms share architectural DNA. At their core, these platforms must solve complex multi-tenancy challenges that balance the needs of three distinct stakeholders: 

* the SaaS provider
* each intermediate business
* all the end users.

The technical scaffolding required to support these demands thoughtful approaches to data isolation, user management, and access control.

Multi-tenancy is the architectural backbone of such platforms. Whether you're dealing with consumer interactions or employee workflows, you need to create logical or physical data separation. These prevent contamination between different businesses data and environments.

This typically manifests through either separate infrastructure or a tenant id on all data with shared infrastructure. You also need carefully designed access control layers to ensure that there's no crosstalk between tenants.

User identification and conversion are important technical and business challenges as well. Each platform must develop methods for determining which tenant a specific user belongs to, whether that's an employee accessing a corporate learning management system or a consumer interacting with a white-labeled financial service, while requiring as little effort as possible from the end user. Techniques to identify the correct tenant for a given user include:

* unique hostnames for each intermediate customer such as tenantA.example.com or tenantb.example.com.
* user self-identification: A user provides a tenant identifier that determines the tenant, in a separate field in the authentication process.
* user choice, where a user logs in and is presented with a list of intermediate businesses. They then choose the business whose application they want to use.
* request attributes, which is when there is an attribute of the client or incoming request, such as the IP address or client user agent, which can be used to route the user to the correct tenant.

The intermediate business needs visibility into their tenant's performance, user behaviors, and platform utilization. Customer service becomes more of a challenge, requiring support mechanisms that can drill down into specific tenant contexts, perhaps only for a given duration or limited to certain tenants.

While SaaS offerings often simplify operations, because the SaaS business is in control of the deployment environment, B2B2U models require more careful balancing acts between flexibility, security, and scalability. The intermediate business expects customization capabilities, reporting, and the ability to configure the platform to their specific organizational needs. Meanwhile, end users—whether employees or consumers—demand seamless, intuitive experiences. 

## Authentication Differences Between B2B2C And B2B2E

We just looked at the similarities between B2B2C and B2B2E; let's look at some differences. In particular, let's examine the differences in how these users handle user identity. As a reminder, end users in B2B2C systems are or might pay the intermediate business. With B2B2E, the end users are being paid by the intermediate business. This critical difference has impacts on how the users authenticate.

### What B2B2C SaaS Businesses Need

B2B2C platforms must recognize that the end consumer fundamentally owns their identity. This means they must balance between platform flexibility and security constraints, designing identity management systems that allow users to maintain control over their personal information while meeting the intermediate business's security and compliance requirements.

The intermediate business in a B2B2C model is deeply invested in the user's authentication and engagement journey in their application. They are typically concerned with many technical and business-critical elements:

* implementing robust password policies that balance security with user experience
* optimizing conversion funnels
* enabling self-service registration and profile management
* allowing or enforcing multi-factor authentication as required
* designing self-service account recovery flows to let users regain access without contacting customer support

All of these concerns originate from the fact that the intermediate business wants the end user to pay for the application they are providing.

From the SaaS provider's perspective, you have to handle scalability challenges and economic considerations—such as the potential cost of maintaining inactive user accounts or designing pricing models that incentivize active platform engagement.

### What B2B2E SaaS Businesses Need

With B2B2E systems, identity management takes on a fundamentally different character compared to B2B2c. Here, the intermediate business owns and controls user identity. Rather than trying to entice the user to sign up or log in while balancing security needs, here the intermediate business can dictate the experience.

Unlike B2B2C platforms where users maintain identity ownership, B2B2E platforms need identity integration mechanisms, primarily through protocols like Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and OpenID Connect (OIDC). These enable centralized identity management witth features these businesses need.

The intermediate business is concerned with granular access control and rapid identity lifecycle management. Enterprises need to provision and deprovision access when employees join or leave the organization, making SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) integration important. 

From the SaaS provider's perspective, you need to be able to: 

* develop robust role mapping capabilities that can translate remote enterprise roles into application-specific access permissions
* create self-service onboarding processes that allow new customers to securely add new identity providers with minimal friction

The SaaS identity platform must be flexible enough to support enterprise identity infrastructures while maintaining security and usability guardrails.

## In Summary

Business-to-Business-to-User platforms, both B2B2C and B2B2E, bridge multiple stakeholders through intricate identity, security, and integration architectures. 

These models share fundamental challenges around multi-tenancy, data isolation, and complex user management, while diverging in identity ownership and control. B2B2C platforms prioritize user-controlled identity with intermediate business oversight, whereas B2B2E models center enterprise control and access management. 

Both require SaaS providers to develop flexible, scalable applications and platforms to accommodate varied business requirements, complex authentication protocols, and bespoke security needs. As a SaaS provider, you need to balance security, performance, and user experience across multiple organizational boundaries.
