Vatix needed a scalable, automated solution that could integrate with their enterprise customers' identity providers

## The Challenge

[Vatix](https://vatix.com/) specializes in safety and compliance software, providing customizable incident reporting solutions for enterprise organizations. As the company grew, it found itself at a crossroads with its authentication system. The needs of their clients, especially enterprise customers, expanded to require advanced authentication features.

Vatix was using a homegrown authentication system that started showing limitations. It worked for a time but couldn't handle the complexity that came with a scaling business. The system required manual intervention each time Vatix onboarded a new client, creating bottlenecks that slowed down operations and made it difficult to meet customer needs.

Adrian Abad, the product manager at Vatix, explained, "Managing different authentication needs for each client had become a challenge. We needed an authentication solution that could integrate with enterprise identity providers, handle various environments, and meet diverse compliance standards."

Time was another critical issue:

>Setting up authentication for each new client consumed many developer hours and relied heavily on one developer's availability. This manual process increased the risk of errors and potential security vulnerabilities.

## The Solution

Vatix found that FusionAuth's out-of-the-box solution, API flexibility, and enterprise integration capabilities were exactly what they were looking for in an authentication provider. After selecting FusionAuth, the development team now has one authentication system to code against, with all the complexity and diversity of client auth systems abstracted away.

FusionAuth allowed Vatix to automate many processes that previously required manual work. The onboarding process for new clients, once slow and cumbersome, is now streamlined. FusionAuth's APIs took over much of the heavy lifting, enabling any team member to complete client setups.

Abad emphasized the importance of FusionAuth's scalability, "It ensured we could handle growing customer demands without running into performance issues. The documentation provided by FusionAuth was instrumental in getting the system up and running quickly. It was thorough, easy to understand, and allowed the Vatix team to implement the solution without requiring constant support."

A significant advantage FusionAuth offered was the ability to integrate with enterprise identity providers. This feature is essential for Vatix's enterprise customers who require [single sign-on (SSO)](/articles/authentication/how-sso-works) to manage access across various systems. FusionAuth's support for [identity providers](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/identity-providers/) like Microsoft Azure and Okta meant that their users could log in securely, using a much more streamlined authentication process.

While FusionAuth handled the complexities of authentication processes, Vatix retained control over other aspects of management. They could customize how users were onboarded, managed, and assigned roles inside their platforms.

## The Results

Since adopting FusionAuth, Vatix has experienced a noticeable boost in efficiency and customer satisfaction. Abad explained, "If we need to set up SSO, customer success will do it as part of the onboarding, not the developers. If we need to change the password policy, customer success will change it in two minutes."

>Automating customer deployments has allowed Vatix to focus on what truly matters: building and improving their core product. Instead of spending valuable time managing multiple authentication systems, they can now dedicate more energy to innovation and meeting the unique needs of their customers.

Abad pointed out one of the biggest benefits â€“ being part of the conversation:

>"We have heard from some IT managers of companies that they discard even software options in the buying process if they don't have SSO. That was another trigger for us to do this properly."

Choosing FusionAuth has also saved Vatix from needing to hire additional senior developers just to manage authentication. Its scalability and flexibility mean that as Vatix grows, FusionAuth will be able to handle any increased demand. This has given Vatix peace of mind, knowing they have a reliable system in place to support their continued growth into new markets and industries.

"FusionAuth allows us to remain focused on our actual effort and shields us from fighting with upstream identity providers in strange environments that we're not familiar with," Abad concluded. "We are much more confident that FusionAuth will implement the authentication system correctly compared to our homegrown, quasi-maintained version."
