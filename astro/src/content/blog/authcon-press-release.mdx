Dec. 3 2024, Westminster, Colorado: FusionAuth is launching [AuthCon](https://authcon.io), the first-ever conference dedicated to Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM). Set for May 14-15, 2025, and coinciding with apidays New York, this inaugural event will empower product and engineering teams to explore cutting-edge CIAM trends, tools, and best practices.

Engineering has changed substantially since the inception of the CIAM category nearly a decade ago. While most conferences now touch on authentication as a secondary topic, [AuthCon](https://authcon.io) will put customer identity front and center — giving product and engineering teams the tools to integrate the latest CIAM strategies with their business priorities.

"Customer identity is no longer just a side concern; it's central to how businesses interact with their customers and how engineers build the systems that power those interactions," says Heather Flanagan, IDPro Executive Director. "It’s about equipping technical teams with the tools and knowledge they need to make authentication decisions that not only address security but also align with the evolving technologies and strategies driving modern development."

Brian Pontarelli, CEO and Founder of FusionAuth, said, "I’m excited to kick off the world’s first customer identity conference in NYC along with apidays. The industry has been missing a conference targeted specifically at developers who are building applications. These applications require login and when the login stops working, the application stops working. That means login is a mission critical component, so it deserves its own conference! [AuthCon](https://authcon.io) will help developers learn how to implement industry leading tools and processes to secure their login, registration, and much more."

## A Conference to Tackle Today’s CIAM Challenges

Improving developer productivity is the top priority for 48% of software engineering teams, according to a [Gartner Peer Insights survey](https://www.gartner.com/peer-community/oneminuteinsights/omi-2024-software-engineering-priorities-challenges-top-mind-hfe). However, 52% cite skills gaps as their biggest challenge, and 60% report budget restrictions as a significant barrier. [AuthCon](https://authcon.io) will help engineers and product teams overcome these challenges by offering strategies to streamline authentication, enabling teams to focus more on innovation.

Maintaining in-house authentication systems is a significant security challenge. A [recent report](https://www.verizon.com/business/en-gb/resources/reports/dbir/?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block) shows that 35% of breaches involve stolen credentials, with web application credentials being three times more likely to be exploited than phishing or vulnerabilities. FusionAuth created [AuthCon](https://authcon.io) to help teams navigate these security risks and focus more of their efforts on value-driving activities.

Topher Marie, Founder of Strata and JumpCloud, says, "In today’s engineering landscape, customer identity can no longer be a side topic. It’s at the heart of how organizations deliver seamless, secure, and scalable experiences to their users. Bringing engineering and product teams together to focus specifically on customer identity—separate from broader IAM or security conversations—creates a unique space to tackle the real-world challenges and opportunities in authentication and identity management."

## Adapting CIAM Strategies to New Engineering Realities

The relationship between CIAM and engineering has evolved over the last decade. Technologies like Kubernetes and containers have shifted organizational dynamics, positioning application engineers as key revenue drivers. As a result, every authentication decision now impacts business success. [AuthCon](https://authcon.io) will focus on how teams can integrate CIAM with these emerging technologies and changing dynamics.
