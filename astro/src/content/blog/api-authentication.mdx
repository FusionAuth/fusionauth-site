When you are building out web APIs for web applications, desktop apps or mobile applications to access functionality or data, you need to authenticate these requests. 

You may say to yourself "of course" but there have been incidents where APIs were not protected at relatively large or prominent organizations. TODO put in links

Let's take a look at the options below.

## What Is An API?

First, what is an API? API stands for Application Programming Interface and in the general sense is a way for one piece of software to communicate with another. The method of transport and the format of messages need to be defined, whether a C program is calling into a numeric processing library or a mobile application is requesting user data. 

Web APIs can take a lot of different forms, but a very common one nowadays has the following attributes:

* TLS and HTTP, including verbs, for the transport layer
* JSON and HTTP headers for the message formatting layer

So a browser being controlled by a human being can make a `GET` request against `https://example.com/api/todo` to retrieve todos for a user. The browser is a client and the server is at example.com.

But how does the server know what user to get todos for when it receives a request? And how do you know that the requester is allowed to access them?

That brings up the next question, how do you authenticate and authorize API requests.

## What Are API Authentication Needs

When you are making an API call, the returned value is often data which will be formatted for display to the user. This data could include results of functionality requests such as "when will the car the user requested pick them up".

In all these cases, the user needs to provide some proof of who they are to get access to functionality and/or data.

The authentication mechanism should be:

* secure
* performant

The pre-eminent task any API authentication method must perform is to make sure that only the appropriate callers get data back from the server. There are many aspects to this, including how the initial authentication is performed, looking for unexpected requests, and determining what access is requested and provided.

API authentication methods must also be performant. While a secondary concern, if an API is not accessible due slow authentication of requests, the API is not fulfilling its purpose.

## Possible Options

There are really three choices for API protection.

* No authentication
* Centralized
* Decentralized

The option case is useful when you have a public API that offers the same data or functionality for all users. I once worked on an application that needed tremendous scale and one way it achieved it was to push out JSON formatted messages to Amazon S3, which were then ingested by JavaScript running on millions of browsers. This was a read-only API that had no authentication. Having no authentication simplifies everything and is a good option when it works.

But this type of API is the exception rather than the rule. Far more often, especially if you are using APIs to let clients update data in the server or offering user specific functionality or data, you will need to perform some sort of authentication and authorization.

Let's look at those two options.

TODO note
Authentication is "who are you" and authorization is "what can you do". While they can be separated (car keys authorize without authenticating and a business card (weakly) authenticates without authorizing) they are usually together.

## Centralized Authentication

In this scenario, the client gets an API key, some signifier of who the user is and what they have access to. They then present that API key to the server. The server then verifies the API key is valid and looks up authorization data. Then the request is allowed to go further. If the API key is invalid or the authorization is insufficient for the access requested, the request is denied.

An API key might look like this:

```

```

### Getting The API Key

The user retrieves the API key through an authentication event, typicaly interactive. Then they visit an API key generation portal. 

There are other ways to do this, with ephemeral API keys being created before a request is made, but at the end of the say some central authority is minting API keys.

### How Does The Client Provide The API Key

The client stores the API key securely.
