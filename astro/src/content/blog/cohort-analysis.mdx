## Introduction

Do you know how frequently your customers use your app? Do you know how many people sign up but quickly lose interest in your service? In this article, you'll learn how to use FA track customer statistics: retention rates, customer age analysis, and customer cohorts (groups). While you need to investigate your own application database for reasons *why* customers stay or leave, having a base of FA login stats to work from lets you know who to analyze.

## Some useful customer statistics

data available: customer identifier, registration date, series of login dates

stats per customer: has verified, verification date, acquisition (date registered), login frequency, login regularity, abandonment (date of last login)

groups: for each stat you can create groups to get an idea of numbers of each type of customer

aggregate stats: customers per date, abandonment per date, acquisition by date

stats granularity can be day, month, year

look at how users used your app or support service before abandonment

List of charts:
- Total number of users (split bar chart showing verified/unverified) per year and by month
- New users per year and month
- Number of users per age in years
- Number of logins per year and month
- Number of users that haven't logged in for 1, 2, 6, 12 months
- Number users that haven't logged in for 6 months by year
- Number of users that log in 1,10,>10 times per month

## Extract customer data

While application databases, like FA, store data in a denormalized structure to save space, data analysis needs data to be normalized for fast retrieval and computation.

The first step to analyze your user data in FA is to extract it and store it in a usable format. As this process puts the database under load, you should run it on a copy of your database, or when few users are busy.

Create a file called `extract.mjs` and insert the code below. Change the variables at the top to match your FA instance.

```js
import * as fs from 'fs/promises';

const applicationId = 'e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e';
const apiKey = '33052c8a-c283-4e96-9d2a-eb1215c69f8f-not-for-prod';
const faUrl = 'http://fa:9011';

async function getFaData(url) {
	try {
		const response = await fetch(faUrl+url, {
			method: 'GET',
			headers: {
				'Authorization': apiKey,
				'Content-Type': 'application/json'
			}
		});
		if (!response.ok) {
			console.error(`httpError! status: ${response.status}`);
			return;
		}
		const result = await response.json();
		return result;
	}
	catch (error) {
		console.error(error.message);
	}
}

async function getUsersFromFaUsers(faUsers) {
	const users = [];
	for (let faUser of faUsers) {
		const identity = faUser.identities.filter((i) => i.primary)[0];
		const registration = faUser.registrations.filter((r) => r.applicationId == applicationId)[0];
		if (!registration || !identity) continue;
		const user = {
			'id': faUser.id,
			'email': faUser.email,
			'isVerified': identity.verified || ![`Completed`, `Implicit`, `Pending`].includes(identity.verifiedReason),
			'registeredDate': registration.insertInstant,
			'loginDates': []
		}
		const logins = await getFaData('/api/system/login-record/search?userId='+user.id+'&startRow=0&numberOfResults=999999');
		logins.logins.map((l) => {user.loginDates.push(l.instant);});
		user.loginDates.sort();
		users.push(user);
		console.log('Extracted user ' + user.email);
	};
	return users;
}

let faUsers = await getFaData("/api/user/search?queryString=*&numberOfResults=999999&startRow=0");
faUsers = faUsers.users;
console.log('Got all users');

await fs.writeFile('faUsers.json', JSON.stringify(faUsers, null, 2));
console.log('Wrote FA users to faUsers.json');

const users = await getUsersFromFaUsers(faUsers);
await fs.writeFile('users.json', JSON.stringify(users, null, 2));
console.log('Wrote extracted users to users.json');
```

Run the file with the command below.

```sh
node extract.mjs
```

This command creates two files, `faUsers.json` containing the raw data from FA, and `users.json` containing the processed set of users with all login dates but all other fields removed.

The `users.json` file has structure below.

```js
[{
  id: string
  email: string
  isVerified: bool
  registeredDate: string // timestamp since 1970
  loginDates: string[] // where [0] is oldest date
}]
```

## Calculate user statistics and display in charts

Create a file called `app.mjs` and insert the code below.

```js
```

Run the code with the command below.

```sh
npm install express
node app.mjs
```

## Summary

## Appendix — How to create fake customer data in FA

To create an FA application with fake users and login data you need to run a JS and SQL script.

Create a file called `fake.mjs` containing the code below. It will register 10 000 new users when run.

```js
async function registerUsers(num) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('http://fa:9011/api/user/registration', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          Authorization: '33052c8a-c283-4e96-9d2a-eb1215c69f8f-not-for-prod',
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          user: { email: `${i}@example.com`, password: 'password' },
          registration: { applicationId: 'e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e' }
        })
      });
      if (!response.ok) {
        const errorBody = await response.text();
        console.log(`httpError ${response.status} for user ${i}@example.com: ${errorBody}`);
        return;
      }
      const result = await response.json();
      console.log(JSON.stringify(result));
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(`networkError for user ${i}@example.com: ${(error).message}`);
    }
    console.log('');
  }
}

await registerUsers(10000);
```

Adjust the URL, authorization key, and application Id in the code above to match your FA instance. Then run the file with the command below.

```sh
node fake.mjs
```

If you don't have Node installed, or want to avoid running code directly on your computer, you can use Docker with the command below. (If you're running FA on your local machine, you need to put FA and the command on the same `--network`.)

```sh
docker run --init  -it --rm --name "app" -v ".:/app" -w "/app" --network faNetwork node:25-alpine sh -c  "node fake.mjs";
```

Once the users are created, you need randomize their registration dates, set 5% of user email addresses to unverified, and create thousands of login dates. This can't be done with the FA API, so you need to run SQL directly on the PostgreSQL FA database.

Run the SQL below.

```sql
-- randomize registration dates. a day from 2015 to 2025
UPDATE user_registrations SET insert_instant =
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (
        '2015-01-01'::DATE + (FLOOR(('2025-12-31'::DATE - '2015-01-01'::DATE) * random()))::INT
    )::TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE)::BIGINT;

-- set 5% of users to unverified
UPDATE identities
SET verified = CASE
    WHEN random() < 0.05 THEN false
    ELSE true
END
WHERE identities.is_primary = true;

UPDATE identities
SET verified_reason = 5
WHERE identities.is_primary = true;

-- add login dates
WITH user_min_instant AS (
    SELECT
        user_registrations.users_id,
        MIN(user_registrations.insert_instant) AS minInstant
    FROM
        user_registrations
    GROUP BY
        user_registrations.users_id
),
users_with_series AS (
    SELECT
        users.id AS usersId,
        user_min_instant.minInstant,
        generate_series(1, (10 + floor(random() * 4991))::INTEGER) AS seriesNum -- 10 to 5000 logins
    FROM
        users
    JOIN
        user_min_instant ON users.id = user_min_instant.users_id
)
INSERT INTO raw_logins (applications_id, instant, ip_address, identities_value, identities_type, users_id)
SELECT
    'e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e',
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM
        to_timestamp(users_with_series.minInstant) + (
            (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM '2026-01-01 00:00:00Z'::timestamp) - users_with_series.minInstant) * random()
        * INTERVAL '1 second')
    )::BIGINT,
    '127.0.0.1',
    NULL,
    NULL,
    users_with_series.usersId
FROM
    users_with_series;

-- delete logins for unverified users
delete from raw_logins
where users_id in (select users_id from identities WHERE is_primary=true and verified=false)
```

https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-site/issues/2990 - cohort analysis

not sure how this can be done in fusionauth, as user behaviour and tracking is something you do in your app. all you can do with FA is get a report of when user's signed up (age cohort) and when they last logged in (indiciation of lost customers). so i guess the "app" dan wants is just pulling out user last log in rates over time. maybe i could use some mock data and some js charts.
