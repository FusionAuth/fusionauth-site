## Introduction

Do you know how frequently your customers use your app? Do you know how many people sign up but quickly lose interest in your service? In this article, you'll learn how to use FA to track customer statistics: retention rates, customer age analysis, and customer cohorts (groups). While you need to investigate your own application database for reasons *why* customers stay or leave, having a base of FA login stats to work from lets you know who to analyze.

## Some useful customer statistics

FA has a few built-in charts with views of total logins and registrations in the <Breadcrumb>Reports</Breadcrumb> section. But if you want a deeper analysis, you need to extract your customer data and calculate your own statistics.

data available: customer identifier, registration date, series of login dates

stats per customer: has verified, verification date, acquisition (date registered), login frequency, login regularity, abandonment (date of last login)

groups: for each stat you can create groups to get an idea of numbers of each type of customer

aggregate stats: customers per date, abandonment per date, acquisition by date

stats granularity can be day, month, year

look at how users used your app or support service before abandonment

List of charts:
- Total number of users (split bar chart showing verified/unverified) per year and month
- User acquisition per year and month (sales performance. also cohort by age)
- Number of users per age in years (mirror image of user acquisition per year, but shows customer analysis and retention)
- Number of logins per year and month
- Percent logins per year and month
- Number of users that haven't logged in for 1, 2, 6, 12 months
- Number users that haven't logged in for 6 months by year
- Number of users that log in 0,<=4,>4 times per year in 2025 (cohort)
- Returning users by month (users who haven't logged in in the last 6 months who returned in a specific month (new feature, competitor change, or advertising)

logins affected by how long token lasts, so you need to set your own values in the charts.

## Extract customer data

While application databases, like FA, store data in a denormalized structure to save space, data analysis needs data to be normalized for fast retrieval and computation.

The first step to analyze your user data in FA is to extract it and store it in a usable format. As this process puts the database under load, you should run it on a copy of your database using a separate FA instance.

Create a file called `extract.mjs` and insert the code below. Change the variables at the top to match your FA instance.

```js
import * as fs from 'fs/promises';

```

Run the file with the command below.

```sh
node extract.mjs
```

This command creates two files, `faUsers.json` containing the raw data from FA, and `users.json` containing the processed set of users with all login dates but all other fields removed.

The `users.json` file has structure below.

```js
  [{
    id: string
    email: string
    isVerified: bool
    registeredDate: string // timestamp since 1970
    loginDates: string[] // oldest dates first
  }]
```

### Introduction to Cohort Analysis

Cohort analysis is a behavioral analytics technique that breaks down users into related groups based on shared characteristics or experiences within a defined time span. Instead of looking at users as one monolithic unit, you analyze them through a "lifecycle" lens to see how behavior changes over time.

#### The Three Core Components

* **The Cohort:** A group of users who performed a specific action (usually signing up) within a specific timeframe (a day, week, or month).
* **The Metric:** The behavior you are measuring, such as logins, purchases, or feature usage.
* **The Time Horizon:** The period over which you track that metric (Day 0, Day 1, Week 4, etc.).

#### Why It Matters
Cohort analysis is primarily used to distinguish between **growth** and **retention**. A product might have 10,000 active users, which looks healthy. However, cohort analysis might reveal that 9,000 of those users signed up this month, while only 5% of users from six months ago ever returned. This indicates a "leaky bucket" problem where you are successfully acquiring users but failing to keep them.

#### Types of Cohorts
1.  **Acquisition Cohorts:** Groups defined by *when* they joined. This is the most common type and helps identify if newer versions of your product are better at retaining users than older versions.
2.  **Behavioral Cohorts:** Groups defined by *what they did*. For example, you might compare a cohort of users who uploaded a profile picture in their first hour versus a cohort that didn't. This helps identify the "Aha! moment" where users find value.

### Recommended Charts for Product Owners

Since your dataset is restricted to **registration dates** and **login dates**, you are essentially looking at "Pulse" and "Retention" metrics. Here are several charts that would provide deeper insights for a Product Owner:

#### 1. Retention Heat Map (The "N-Day" Retention)
While your current charts show totals and percentages over time, a heat map shows the percentage of a specific registration cohort that returns in subsequent months.
* **X-Axis:** Months since registration (Month 0, Month 1, Month 2...).
* **Y-Axis:** The registration month (Jan 2025, Feb 2025...).
* **Value:** % of that cohort that logged in during that specific month.
* **PO Value:** Identifies exactly when users drop off. If Month 1 retention is dropping, the onboarding is the problem. If Month 6 retention is dropping, the long-term value proposition is the problem.


#### 3. Time-to-First-Login (Friction Analysis)
* **Calculation:** `firstLoginDate` - `registrationDate`.
* **Visual:** A histogram showing how many users log in immediately, within 24 hours, or after a week.
* **PO Value:** High friction in registration often leads to a "ghost" user base where people register but never actually enter the app.

#### 4. Churn Prediction (The "Slipped Away" Chart) - no , just mention, don't do
This is an evolution of your abandonment chart but focused on the *velocity* of loss.
* **Calculation:** Users who logged in during Month N-1 but did not log in during Month N.
* **PO Value:** This is a leading indicator. If the number of "Slipped Away" users is growing faster than new registrations, the product is in a state of contraction.

#### 5. Login Frequency Distribution (Power User Curve)
* **X-Axis:** Number of days in a month a user logged in (1 to 31).
* **Y-Axis:** Count of users.
* **PO Value:** Also known as the "L30" chart. A "U-shaped" curve (high counts at 1 day and 30 days) indicates a healthy product with a dedicated core of power users. A "left-heavy" curve indicates a product used only for "one-off" tasks.


## Calculate user statistics and display in charts

Create a file called `app.mjs` in the same directory as the `users.json` file you extracted earlier and insert the code below.

```js
// clear; docker run --init  -it --rm --name "app" -v ".:/app" -w "/app" -p 7777:7777 node:24.12.0-slim  sh -c  "node --watch 4app.mjs";

import express from 'express';
import * as fs from 'fs/promises';

```

node app.mjs
```

## Summary

## Appendix — How to create fake customer data in FA

To create an FA application with fake users and login data you need to run a JS and SQL script.

Create a file called `fake.mjs` containing the code below. It will register 10 000 new users when run.

```js
async function registerUsers(num) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('http://fa:9011/api/user/registration', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          Authorization: '33052c8a-c283-4e96-9d2a-eb1215c69f8f-not-for-prod',
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          user: { email: `${i}@example.com`, password: 'password' },
          registration: { applicationId: 'e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e' }
        })
      });
      if (!response.ok) {
        const errorBody = await response.text();
        console.log(`httpError ${response.status} for user ${i}@example.com: ${errorBody}`);
        return;
      }
      const result = await response.json();
      console.log(JSON.stringify(result));
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(`networkError for user ${i}@example.com: ${(error).message}`);
    }
    console.log('');
  }
}

await registerUsers(10000);
```

Adjust the URL, authorization key, and application Id in the code above to match your FA instance. Then run the file with the command below.

```sh
node fake.mjs
```

If you don't have Node installed, or want to avoid running code directly on your computer, you can use Docker with the command below. (If you're running FA on your local machine, you need to put FA and the command on the same `--network`.)

```sh
docker run --init  -it --rm --name "app" -v ".:/app" -w "/app" --network faNetwork node:24.12.0-slim sh -c  "node fake.mjs";
```

Once the users are created, you need randomize their registration dates, set 5% of user email addresses to unverified, and create thousands of login dates. This can't be done with the FA API, so you need to run SQL directly on the PostgreSQL FA database.

Run the SQL below.

```sql
-- randomize registration dates. a day from 2015 to 2025
UPDATE user_registrations SET insert_instant =
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (
        '2015-01-01'::DATE + (FLOOR(('2025-12-31'::DATE - '2015-01-01'::DATE) * random()))::INT
    )::TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE)::BIGINT;

-- check dates if you want
-- SELECT * FROM user_registrations

-- set 5% users to unverified
UPDATE identities
SET verified = CASE
    WHEN random() < 0.05 THEN false
    ELSE true
END
WHERE identities.is_primary = true;

UPDATE identities
SET verified_reason = 5
WHERE identities.is_primary = true;

-- add login dates
WITH user_min_instant AS (
    SELECT
        user_registrations.users_id,
        MIN(user_registrations.insert_instant) AS minInstant
    FROM
        user_registrations
    GROUP BY
        user_registrations.users_id
),
users_with_series AS (
    SELECT
        users.id AS usersId,
        user_min_instant.minInstant,
        generate_series(1, (1 + floor(random() * 4991))::INTEGER) AS seriesNum -- 10 to 5000 logins
    FROM
        users
    JOIN
        user_min_instant ON users.id = user_min_instant.users_id
)
INSERT INTO raw_logins (applications_id, instant, ip_address, identities_value, identities_type, users_id)
SELECT
    'e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e',
    (users_with_series.minInstant + FLOOR(
        (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM '2026-01-01 00:00:00Z'::timestamp) - users_with_series.minInstant) * random()
    ))::BIGINT,
    '127.0.0.1',
    NULL,
    NULL,
    users_with_series.usersId
FROM
    users_with_series;

-- delete logins for unverified users
delete from raw_logins
where users_id in (select users_id from identities WHERE is_primary=true and verified=false)
```
