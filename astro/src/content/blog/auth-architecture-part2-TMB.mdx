## Introduction

This post discusses the token-mediating backend (TMB) authentication architecture for OAuth 2 apps: how secure it is, when to use it, and how to implement it.

<Aside type="tip">
This is part two of a three part series on OAuth architectures. Please read [part one](/blog/backend-for-frontend-security-architecture), if you haven't already, so you understand how the BFF architecture works, since TMB is a variation of BFF.
</Aside>

## What Is A Token-Mediating Backend?

The TMB is identical to the BFF pattern, except for one big difference: access tokens are stored in the frontend (desktop app, mobile app, or web app) instead of in the backend. (Refresh tokens are still stored on the backend). Since the access token is now available in the browser, the browser can call a resource server directly, instead of having to call the backend and get the backend to call the resource server with the token.

TMB is described in the IETF document on [best practices for OAuth apps](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-browser-based-apps#name-token-mediating-backend).

## How Secure Is A TMB?

TMB is massively less secure than BFF (since access tokens in the browser are vulnerable to exfiltration by malicious JavaScript packages and cross-site scripting (XSS)), but slightly more secure than serverless web apps (browser-based OAuth clients (BBOC)), which have no secure backend at all.

Both BFF and TMB are vulnerable to fraudulent requests if an attacker manages to inject malicious JavaScript into the browser (client hijacking). But BFF prevents the attacker from using the token from the attacker's computer (token exfiltration) while TMB does not.

You can think of the security advantages as: BFF ≫ TMB > BBOC.

TMB has two of the security advantages of BFF:

- Same-site HTTP-only session cookies, as well as PKCE checks and OIDC nonces, prevent CSRF attacks.
- Refresh tokens stay on the server, hidden from attackers.

In a TMB frontend, the access token in the browser can't be kept in an HTTP-only cookie, because JavaScript needs to access it to send it in calls to resource servers (which have different URL domains to the authorization server domain). Since the access token has to be stored in the browser's local storage or application memory, it's vulnerable to exfiltration by XSS attacks, like malicious npm packages or unsanitized HTML from forum posts on your site.

A TMB is slightly more secure than a BBOC because of the server-side refresh token — if you follow best practices.

You can set the expiry period of your access tokens to be very short (ten minutes), so that if an attacker does gain access to the token, they can't use it for long. The frontend can silently ask the server for a new access token generated from the server-side refresh token every ten minutes, so the user does not need to log in again. Or, for security-critical apps like banking, you can require the user to log in again every time their access token expires. If you detect unauthorized use of an access token, you can revoke the refresh token and force a user to log in again.

Of course, if an attacker has managed to insert malicious JavaScript into your frontend, they can steal the access tokens again and again, so access token timeouts won't protect you. However, once the user closes their browser, all fraudulent requests must pause. Mobile and desktop apps are generally safer than web apps because they are less likely to use JavaScript.

For a list of best practices mitigating the danger of client-side token storage, read the [recommendations by the IETF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9700/), or this [summary](https://maida.kim/oauth2-best-practices-for-developers) by a FusionAuth developer.

### Demonstrating Proof Of Possession (DPoP)

There is one relatively new technology (2023) that makes client-side tokens a lot safer — DPoP, standing for Demonstrating Proof of Possession, and available as IETF [RFC 9449](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9449).

DPoP is complicated enough to warrant an entire article, and the [official site](https://dpop.info) has a great visual walkthrough of the protocol, but the concept is simple enough to understand.

If an OAuth access token is like a door key, which can be stolen, using DPoP is like a door that can be unlocked only with the key and having you sign your signature when trying to enter. An attacker with only the key can't open the door because they can't fake your signature.

How it actually works is the access token is cryptographically bound to the DPoP key at creation, and both must be sent in calls to a resource server. A request to a resource server with an access token that isn't signed by the DPoP key will be rejected.

If the attacker can steal the access token in JavaScript, why can't they steal the DPoP key too? The DPoP key is stored using the browser's web cryptography API with [`extractable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CryptoKey/extractable) set to `false`. This means a request to a resource server can be signed with the DPoP key in the browser, but the key can never leave the browser or be accessed by JavaScript, preventing exfiltration.

An attacker that manages to insert malicious JavaScript into your browser could make calls using both the DPoP key and access code, but if the attacker exfiltrates the access code to their own machine, it's useless without the DPoP key. So DPoP makes storing access tokens in the browser as secure as using a BFF. Remember that if an attacker manages to run malicious JavaScript in the user's browser (client hijacking), the attacker can make fraudulent requests as the user both in the TMB and BFF patterns.

The security ranking is: (BFF = TMB with DPoP) ≫ TMB > BBOC.

DPoP is not yet supported by FusionAuth, but [requested](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1679).

## When To Use A TMB?

Since TMB is much less secure than BFF, there are very few reasons to choose TMB. Below are three.

### Latency

Since TMB allows the browser to call the resource server directly, it avoids the extra time taken to route the call via the app backend. For a general web application, like a bank or forum, this time is irrelevant. But for apps where real-time performance is critical, like games, voice and video chat, or collaborative document editing, this time could create noticeable lag.

### Infrastructure

Hosting a web app with large JavaScript files and images can be costly. You might want to serve your frontend from a cheap static file host, and run your API on a more expensive cloud server. This is more difficult using BFF than TMB, because the BFF design needs the backend to live on the same URL origin as the frontend (or configure complex cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)), so you need a reverse proxy for URL redirects between the two servers. TMB doesn't have this constraint, as it is used only for the initial login, not proxying every call to other servers.

### Skill And Time

If you are not a professional programmer and can't afford to hire one, you might be making an app by combining various low-code services. If the default architecture of your authentication provider is TMB and not BFF, that's what you're stuck with, and you don't have time to experiment with changing it.

If this is the case, please know that implementing your own BFF server can literally be a single page of JavaScript. FusionAuth has an [example repository demonstrating this](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-hostedbackend/tree/main/nodeApp) (see the files `app.js` and `authentication.js`) with an [accompanying tutorial](/blog/backend-for-frontend#how-to-create-a-bff-for-a-serverless-app).

Even simpler, if you use FusionAuth (which is free if you host it yourself), you can use the built-in FusionAuth [hosted backend](/docs/apis/hosted-backend). The tutorial mentioned above also includes an example serverless HTML file with [two small JavaScript functions](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-hostedbackend/blob/main/serverlessApp/index.html) that give you fully secure authentication by connecting to the hosted backend.

## Getting Technical: How The TMB Flow Works

This section explains the TMB OAuth flow in more detail. It is based on the [official text from the IETF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-browser-based-apps#name-application-architecture-2).

Below is the sequence if the browser loads the app and still has a session cookie from the previously active session.

<BrowserActiveSessionDiagram />

If there is no session, the user has to log in. This sequence is shown below.

<BrowserNoSessionDiagram />

For a more detailed explanation of every step in the flow, please see the accompanying repository [README section on TMB](https://github.com/kmaida/auth-architecture/tree/main/tmb#how-tmb-authentication-works).

## See TMB In Action: A Complete Demonstration

To help you get started using TMB, you can use a complete FusionAuth demonstration repository. The repository includes a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend, demonstrating the TMB pattern with FusionAuth as the authorization server. Of course, you can adapt the backend to any language or framework.

This section allows you to run a simple but functional TMB web app and server with FusionAuth to see how it works.

### Download And Start FusionAuth

To follow along, you'll need Git, Node.js, npm, and Docker installed. While it's not explained here, you could use Deno (or Node in Docker if know how to change your network settings) instead of Node.

Open a terminal and clone the repository with Git using the commands below.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kmaida/auth-architecture.git
cd auth-architecture
cp .env.sample .env
```

Next, start the FusionAuth server with Docker.

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

This should download docker images and start FusionAuth on `http://localhost:9011/admin`. You can log in with the default admin credentials provided in the README: `admin@example.com` and `password`.

Now you have an authentication provider running.

### Start The Backend App Server

Run the commands below to prepare the backend settings file for editing.

```sh
cd tmb/backend
cp .env.sample .env
```

Open the `tmb/backend/.env` file in a text editor and change the first two lines to match the settings below.

```js
CLIENT_ID="e72dca1d-626c-4f4b-8f36-b7c8c2c0af33"
CLIENT_SECRET="TC3Kmq9yNgudIHl8BKLJXJFAhd8AmzfTwjJSqAFJJ-k"
```

Start the server with the command below.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

The backend is now running at http://localhost:4001, but does not provide a website. It is only an API.

Now you have an authentication provider and an API to call.

### Start The Frontend

In a new terminal in the repository directory, run the commands below to prepare the frontend settings file.

```sh
cd tmb/frontend
cp .env.sample .env
```

Start the server with the command below.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Now you have an authentication provider, backend API, and frontend website running and can test the full system.

Browse to the frontend at http://localhost:5173.

![TMB website homepage when logged out](/img/blogs/auth-architecture/loggedOut.png)

Click the log in button at the top right and log in with the test user `user@example.com` with password `password`. (The login page is served by FusionAuth, not by the app, but both pages have matching visual style).

![TMB website login page](/img/blogs/auth-architecture/logIn.png)

Once logged in, you can browse to private pages on the site. You can also see that all the FusionAuth authentication cookies are set as `HttpOnly`, so they can't be stolen. The access token is stored in application memory, where there is less chance of theft than being kept in browser storage, which malicious JavaScript might scan by default.

### How It Works

Let's take a quick look at how this app works under the hood.

The authentication provider, FusionAuth, stores user authentication details and provides the login page that the app redirects to. The user you logged in with, and the CSS styling, was created with a FusionAuth feature called [Kickstart](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/kickstart). The `kickstart` directory is a set of configuration files that allow you to start an instance of FusionAuth with pre-created users, applications, visual style, and other settings.

The backend project is the most complex of the three architecture components. It handles the OAuth interaction between FusionAuth and the frontend, and provides the API that acts as a resource server. The backend is an Express.js server (`server.ts`) that handles authentication in `auth.ts` and the files in the `utils` directory. You should be able to understand the code by reading the [flow process](https://github.com/kmaida/auth-architecture/tree/main/tmb#how-tmb-authentication-works) detailed in the README file.

The authentication flow is hand-coded in this example to make it understandable and explicit, but in reality you should use a library like [Passport.js](https://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-oauth2) to do most of the OAuth 2 work. Passport handles only the interaction between your backend and FusionAuth, not between your backend and your frontend. The important part of TMB that Passport leaves to you is getting session management correct (`utils/session.ts`) and separating the refresh token on the server from the access token returned to the browser.

The frontend project is very simple. Its only dependency is the React.js ecosystem, and authentication is handled manually in `services/AuthContext.jsx`. Since the FusionAuth webpage redirect handles login, the only authentication work the frontend needs to do is check whether the user is logged in, and get new access tokens.

## Summary

The recommendation of this article, and the whole series, is to use BFF for authentication and authorization as it is far more secure than TMB and BBOC. The only time you can justify using TMB instead of a secure backend is when your app needs near real-time speed or if you have an insurmountable infrastructure constraint.

If your authentication provider doesn't support BFF, you can implement one using FusionAuth for free, either as the identity provider itself or merely the gateway that securely proxies authentication. See the [tutorial](/blog/backend-for-frontend#use-a-premade-bff) to learn how.

## Coming Up In Part 3...

The [final post](/blog/browser-based-oauth-client-security-architecture) in this series discusses the third and least secure OAuth architecture: BBOC. You'll learn how it works and the rare cases when you might choose it.
