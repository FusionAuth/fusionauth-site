### Q: What about vendor lock-in concerns?
**A:** FusionAuth's single-tenant architecture actually reduces operational lock-in since you can migrate between deployment models (cloud, self-hosted, hybrid) without architectural changes. FusionAuth prides itself on making certain that your data is alaways available to you, and we make it easy to migrate away if the need arises.

### Q: How do operational costs compare beyond licensing?
**A:** While Keycloak has zero licensing costs, the operational overhead creates higher total costs. FusionAuth requires less than 30 minutes weekly maintenance vs 3+ hours for Keycloak, plus significantly lower infrastructure and training costs.

### Q: Which platform handles scale better?
**A:** FusionAuth's single-tenant architecture provides predictable scaling without the performance degradation Keycloak experiences after 100-200 realms. Each FusionAuth instance scales independently without affecting others.

## Conclusion: Making the Strategic Choice

For teams prioritizing **total cost of ownership optimization, developer productivity, and operational efficiency**, FusionAuth delivers superior value despite licensing costs. The 62% TCO reduction, 90% training time decrease, and 85% maintenance overhead reduction typically outweigh Keycloak's feature breadth.

### Key Insight
While Keycloak offers robust features out-of-the-box, FusionAuth's operational efficiency and developer experience advantages typically outweigh any advantage Keycloak might have for most Application Engineering teams, especially when factoring in total cost of ownership and engineering productivity impact.
