## Definitions

- **Single-Tenant Architecture**: A deployment model where each customer or application instance runs in complete isolation with dedicated resources and databases, eliminating performance interference and providing enhanced security boundaries compared to multi-tenant shared infrastructure
- **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**: The comprehensive cost analysis including licensing, infrastructure, operations, training, and maintenance over a 3-year period, revealing that "free" solutions often carry higher operational costs than commercial alternatives
- **Kickstart Automation**: FusionAuth's configuration-as-code approach using JSON files to automate complete environment setup, enabling reproducible deployments and seamless CI/CD pipeline integration versus manual GUI-based configuration
- **Noisy Neighbor Effect**: Performance degradation that occurs in multi-tenant systems when one tenant's high resource usage impacts other tenants sharing the same infrastructure, eliminated by FusionAuth's single-tenant isolation
- **Operational Lock-in**: The practical difficulty of migrating between solutions due to complex operational requirements, specialized expertise needs, or architectural dependencies, often more restrictive than licensing lock-in
