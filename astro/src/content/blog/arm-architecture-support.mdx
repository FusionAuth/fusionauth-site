[FusionAuth](/), the authentication and authorization platform built for developers, today announced its support for ARM-based architecture. Since its inception, FusionAuth has committed to running anywhere, and supporting the ARM architecture further allows developers to run FusionAuth where and how they want. By working with ARM processors, the company is able to support additional use cases such as IoT and high-performance cloud platforms that are built on ARM-based architectures.

“The engineers we built FusionAuth for are the same ones that are building the next generation of technology,” said Daniel DeGroff, co-CTO at FusionAuth. “Because we are developers ourselves, we’ve seen the shift toward ARM-based infrastructure and have prepared appropriately. We will always prioritize resources to ensure developers have what they need to make auth simple, secure and deployable anywhere.”  

Developers of all kinds -from hobbyists to professionals building technology in enterprise cloud or desktop environments - are moving to ARM to take advantage of the architecture's cost savings and performance gains. FusionAuth is committed to continually identifying ways to make developers’ lives easier and let them build on the technology of their choice.

### About FusionAuth

FusionAuth is the authentication and authorization platform built for developers, by developers. It solves the problem of building essential user security without adding risk or distracting from the primary application. For developers and technical leaders creating products for external users, FusionAuth puts them in the driver’s seat, with control, flexibility and developer ergonomics. FusionAuth tames the risk and complexity that comes with typical identity systems. With self-hosted or cloud software, extensive documentation, free options, fast deployment and a no-hassle process, it eliminates the business hurdles that make it hard for developers to meet their authentication and authorization requirements.
