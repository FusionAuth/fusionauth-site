FusionAuth is one of the most flexible authentication platforms out there. Whether you want FusionAuth to host it for you, download and run it on your own hardware or deploy it in the cloud the choice is yours. Since the [FusionAuth Partner Network Launch](/blog/fusionauth-partner-program) was recently announced, it seems like a good time to talk about how to set up FusionAuth on one of the partner's platforms. For this post we will be talking about how to deploy FusionAuth on the [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine?hl=en).

{/* more */}
## Requirements
There are a few things that you will need to make sure you have access to and have up and running on your machine
* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/gcp) is a set of computing services offered by Google that allows users to build and run applications and websites.
* [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) is a command line interface used to manage resources in Google Cloud.
* [kuebctl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) is another command line tool that will allow you to run commands against a Kubernetes cluster.
* [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) is a package manager used for installing and managing Kubernetes applications.

## Project Setup
Once you have the prerequisites, you will need to set up a project within Google.

Each of these commands can take up to a few minutes to complete and appear ready in the Google Cloud Console, please be patient. This is just some of the fun you get to experience when working in the cloud.

Open a new terminal window and perform the following steps.

### Authorize Gcloud
```shell title="Authorize gcloud"
gcloud auth login
```

### Create A New Project And Set As Default
```shell title="Create a project"
gcloud projects create fusionauth-gke-example \
  --name="FusionAuth GKE example"
```
It is important to note that Google Project Ids must be unique. If you receive a message stating that the project creation failed but the project Id you specified is already in use, you will need to add an unique Id. Something along the lines of fusionauth-gke-example-0302, where 0302 is a number unique to you, should do the trick. Be sure to write it down as you will need that unique project Id throughout this tutorial.

You should receive a message when the action is complete and the project has been created. Be sure you are using your unique Id.

```shell title="Set the default project"
gcloud config set project fusionauth-gke-example
```

### Enable Billing For The Project
Once you have created the project, you will need to enable billing for it.
* In a web browser, navigate to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). 
* Ensure you select the project created in the previous steps. 
* Select <Breadcrumb>Billing</Breadcrumb>.
* Link a Billing Account to the project. If you do not have an existing Billing Account, you may have to create one.

### Enable Required APIs
You will use <Breadcrumb>gcloud</Breadcrumb> to enable the needed services and apis for the project.

Enable the [Kubernetes Engine API](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/reference/rest). This will allow you to make a service request to the API to create your GKE cluster:

```shell title="Enable Kubernetes Engine API"
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
```

You will need to enable the [Cloud SQL API](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/admin-api) in order to create a PostgreSQL database. Run the following command to do this:

```shell title="Enable Cloud SQL API"
gcloud services enable sqladmin.googleapis.com
```

In order for our GKE cluster to communicate with PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch on internal IP addresses, the [Service Networking API](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/service-networking/getting-started) must be enabled:

```shell title="Enable Cloud SQL API"
gcloud services enable servicenetworking.googleapis.com \
    --project=fusionauth-gke-example
```

## Configure the Network
Now that you have the project set up and APIs enabled, it is time to set up the virtual network that will allow FusionAuth to run on GKE.

Allocate an IP address range for private communication on your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):

```shell title="Create a private IP address range"
gcloud compute addresses create fusionauth-private-range \
  --global \
  --purpose=VPC_PEERING \
  --addresses=192.168.0.0 \
  --prefix-length=16 \
  --description="Fusionauth private IP range for GKE and SQL" \
  --network=default
```

In order for GKE to communicate with Cloud SQL over a private network you need to create a private connection from your VPC network to the underlying service producer network.

```shell title="Create a private connection"
gcloud services vpc-peerings connect \
  --service=servicenetworking.googleapis.com \
  --ranges=fusionauth-private-range \
  --network=default \
  --project=fusionauth-gke-example
```

<Aside type="tip">If you get an error here, remember to check your "--project" value. Did you include your unique Id?</Aside>

## Create a GKE Cluster

With your project configured, billing enabled, and the Kubernetes Engine API enabled, you can proceed to create your GKE cluster. If the work cluster scares you a bit, don't worry.  It is just a group of computing nodes that work together to run containerized applications. It is managed by a control plane that automates the deployment of containers across the cluster. The control plane also manages the overall state of the cluster and handles things like scheduling workloads and ensuring the desired state of the cluster is maintained.

To create a new cluster in the us-west1 region with one node, execute the following.

```shell title="Create GKE cluster"
gcloud container clusters create fusionauth-cluster \
  --num-nodes=1 \
  --region=us-west1 \
  --enable-ip-alias \
  --cluster-version=1.30.9-gke.1009000 \
  --cluster-ipv4-cidr=10.44.0.0/14 \
  --services-ipv4-cidr=10.48.0.0/20 \
  --labels=goog-partner-solution=isol_plb32_001kf000012eawziay_hgq452iixrlzpeddhfr5gp4uxglz5lvn
```

<Aside type="tip">
This can take several minutes to complete and the terminal should keep you updated on the progress. If you receive an error message stating "Master version '1.30.9-gke.1009000' is unsupported.", please see the Google documentation for [currently supported versions](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes). Replace the value for <InlineField>--cluster-version</InlineField> with a value that is supported.
</Aside>

### Update Kubernetes Configuration

If [the create operation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/create) completed successfully, the last thing it will do is update your local `~/.kube` configuration. If that didn't happen for whatever reason, `gcloud` provides the following to update your configuration and set the newly created cluster as the active context. This will let you use `kubectl` to access your cluster.

```shell title="Get and update Kubeconfig"
gcloud container clusters get-credentials fusionauth-cluster
```

### Verify Cluster Configuration

Execute the [list](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/list) command to see GKE clusters that have been configured.

```shell title="Get cluster information"
gcloud container clusters list
```

```shell title="Cluster list results"
NAME                LOCATION  MASTER_VERSION      MASTER_IP       MACHINE_TYPE  NODE_VERSION        NUM_NODES  STATUS
fusionauth-cluster  us-west1  1.30.9-gke.1009000  35.203.129.221  e2-medium     1.30.9-gke.1009000  3          RUNNING
```

## Create a Database

Create a SQL Cloud PostgreSQL instance required for FusionAuth installation.

```shell title="Create Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL instance"
gcloud beta sql instances create fusionauth-test-db \
  --project=fusionauth-gke-example \
  --database-version=POSTGRES_12 \
  --tier=db-g1-small  \
  --region=us-west1 \
  --network=default \
  --no-assign-ip
```
<Aside type="tip">I know it has been a while since you read this but trust me, this will help somebody. If you get an error here, remember to check your "--project" value. Did you include your unique Id?</Aside>

### Configure the Default User

Google cloud SQL requires that you execute the following to configure the `postgres` user.

```shell title="Set admin user password"
gcloud sql users set-password postgres \
  --instance=fusionauth-test-db \
  --password=changeMeToSomethingMoreSecure
```

### Verify Database Creation

```shell title="Get list of Cloud SQL instances in the current project"
gcloud sql instances list
```

```shell title="List Cloud SQL instances results"
NAME                 DATABASE_VERSION  LOCATION    TIER               PRIMARY_ADDRESS  PRIVATE_ADDRESS  STATUS
fusionauth-test-db3  POSTGRES_12       us-west1-a  db-g1-small        -                10.50.144.5      RUNNABLE
```

## Take a Break

You now are running all the necessary infrastructure to deploy a containerized application to GKE. Awesome! Time to take a breather or bio-break if you need one. Once you are refreshed, you can continue.

</div>

## Adding the Helm Chart Repository

For this blog, you are going to use Helm. The first thing to do is add the FusionAuth Helm Chart repository. This can be done with the following.

```shell title="Add a chart repository"
helm repo add fusionauth https://fusionauth.github.io/charts
```

## Helm Chart Configuration

Before you install, configure the `values.yaml` file contents used by the Helm Chart. The majority of the values for this chart have defaults. There will be a few you update for this tutorial.

To update this file, first download it:

```shell title="Download chart values"
curl -o values.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/charts/main/chart/values.yaml
```

Open `values.yaml` with your favorite text editor and modify it.

### Docker Image

You will be using the latest release of FusionAuth.

```yaml title="Image configuration example"
image:
  # image.repository -- The name of the docker repository for fusionauth-app
  repository: fusionauth/fusionauth-app
  # image.repository -- The docker tag to pull for fusionauth-app
  tag: latest
```

## Database Configuration

Now, configure the database connection. You will need to update the section with information from the database you created above.

The following is an example of the `database` configuration section in `values.yaml`. Notice the <InlineField>host</InlineField>, <InlineField>user</InlineField>, <InlineField>password</InlineField>, <InlineField>root:user</InlineField>, <InlineField>root:password</InlineField> will need to be updated with information for the database you created previously.

```yaml title="Database example configuration"
database:
  # database.protocol -- Should either be postgresql or mysql. Protocol for jdbc connection to database
  protocol: postgresql
  # database.host -- Hostname or ip of the database instance
  host: "192.168.0.3"
  # database.host -- Port of the database instance
  port: 5432
  # database.tls -- Configures whether or not to use tls when connecting to the database
  tls: false
  # database.tlsMode -- If tls is enabled, this configures the mode
  tlsMode: require
  # database.name -- Name of the fusionauth database
  name: fusionauth

  # To use an existing secret, set `existingSecret` to the name of the secret. We expect at most two keys: `password` is required. `rootpassword` is only required if `database.root.user` is set.
  # database.existingSecret -- The name of an existing secret that contains the database passwords
  existingSecret: ""
  # database.user -- Database username for fusionauth to use in normal operation
  user: "postgres"
  # database.password -- Database password for fusionauth to use in normal operation - not required if database.existingSecret is configured
  password: "changeMeToSomethingMoreSecure"
  # These credentials are used for bootstrapping the database and creating it if needed. This can be useful for ephemeral clusters used for testing and dev.
  root:
    # database.root.user -- Database username for fusionauth to use during initial bootstrap - not required if you have manually bootstrapped your database
    user: "postgres"
    # database.root.password -- Database password for fusionauth to use during initial bootstrap - not required if database.existingSecret is configured
    password: "changeMeToSomethingMoreSecure"
```

## Search Configuration

There are two options available to configure search in FusionAuth. The first is a simple search through the database search engine and the second is the Elasticsearch engine. For more details on the differences, please see [Search And FusionAuth](/docs/lifecycle/manage-users/search/search). For this example, you will use the database search. You will need to update the `search` section of the `values.yaml` file.

```yaml
search:
  # search.engine -- Defines backend for fusionauth search capabilities. Valid values for engine are 'elasticsearch' or 'database'.
  engine: database
```

## Pod Configuration

You will need to update an additional section of the `values.yaml` file. This will identify FusionAuth as a Google Partner Solution. You will need to find the section for the `podLabels` and replace it with the text below. The key and value will be the same for everyone.

 ```yaml title="Additional podLabels configuration"
podLabels: {
    goog-partner-solution: isol_plb32_001kf000012eawziay_hgq452iixrlzpeddhfr5gp4uxglz5lvn
}
```

## Deploy FusionAuth To the Cluster

Now that `values.yaml` is updated, it is time to install the chart on the cluster. The `helm install` command is used to install a chart by name and can be applied using the syntax:

```shell title="Helm install format"
helm install [CHART NAME] [CHART] [flags]
```

Here you will install a chart including the `-f` flag to override the default values.

```shell title="Install the FusionAuth chart"
helm install my-release fusionauth/fusionauth -f values.yaml
```

## Access FusionAuth
If the previous command was successful, you should see output similar to the following:

```plaintext title="Example output"
NAME: my-release
LAST DEPLOYED: Sun Oct 10 19:23:41 2021
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
NOTES:
1. Get the application URL by running these commands:
  export SVC_NAME=$(kubectl get svc --namespace default -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=fusionauth,app.kubernetes.io/instance=my-release" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
  echo "Visit http://127.0.0.1:9011 to use your application"
  kubectl port-forward svc/$SVC_NAME 9011:9011
```

As instructed by the success message output above, you can create a proxy enabling you to connect to the cluster from `localhost`:

```shell title="Setup port-forwarding proxy"
export SVC_NAME=$(kubectl get svc --namespace default -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=fusionauth,app.kubernetes.io/instance=my-release" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
  echo "Visit http://127.0.0.1:9011 to use your application"
  kubectl port-forward svc/$SVC_NAME 9011:9011
```

```plaintext title="Example output of kubectl proxying command"
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:9011 -> 9011
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:9011` and you will land on the FusionAuth Setup Wizard.

## Next Steps

If you choose to, complete the tutorial walking you through the initial FusionAuth configuration, see [Setup Wizard & First Login](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/setup-wizard/). 

This is a simplified tutorial to get FusionAuth up and running on the Google Kubernetes Engine. For more detail on deploying FusionAuth on Kubernetes, please see the documentation on how [Deploy FusionAuth to a Kubernetes Cluster](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/kubernetes/gke). While some of the information is the same as this blog, it goes into greater detail and show you how to do things like expose the instance you created to the outside world using an [Ingress](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/kubernetes/fusionauth-deployment#create-an-ingress).
