Reduce the overhead associated with customer authentication and authorization when creating a .NET web application using FusionAuth templates. 
{/* more */} 

## Introduction
*Templates for nothing and your security for free.* 

Literally. The [FusionAuth Templates for Microsoft .NET](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FusionAuth.FusionAuthVSTemplates) are free to use and so is the self-hosted [Community plan](/pricing?step=plan&hosting=self-hosting) of FusionAuth.

As a Developer Relations Engineer at FusionAuth, my goal is to help developers develop faster. That's why I'm so excited about the release of our new .NET templates. They're available through the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FusionAuth.FusionAuthVSTemplates) and as a [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FusionAuth.Templates) package, making it easy for developers to get started with FusionAuth and build secure applications quickly and easily.

## Getting Started

### Download The Templates

Let's start by installing the FusionAuth templates using Visual Studio. For those who develop .NET applications outside of Visual Studio, don't worry I'll cover that too. Inside Visual Studio, select `Extensions` from the menu bar and then select `Manage Extensions`.

Enter `FusionAuth` in the search bar. Then, select `Download` when you find the templates. You will need to restart Visual Studio after the templates are downloaded and installed.

For those of you who develop outside of Visual Studio, you can simply issue the following command from the terminal or command line.

```shell
dotnet new install FusionAuth.Templates::1.0.0
```

That's all there is to obtaining the templates.

### FusionAuth Server

Of course, to effectively use these templates you will need an instance of FusionAuth to bang against. If you already have an instance set up, you likely know the settings you will need. If you do not have an instance to point to, don't fear. You can download an instance and have it up and running in no time assuming you have Docker installed. Simply clone the [fusionauth-example-client-libraries](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-client-libraries) info, and spin up the Docker instance using the following command.

```shell
mkdir fusionauth-templates-example
cd fusionauth-templates-example
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-client-libraries.git
cd fusionauth-example-client-libraries
docker compose up -d
```

If things go according to plan, you should now have a fully functioning instance of FusionAuth that has been pre-configured to work with the templates. That means that an application with users has been set up in FusionAuth and you are ready to start developing your application.

If things do not go according to plan, you can find more details in the [Readme.md](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-client-libraries/blob/main/README.md) file in the repository. You could also check out one of our quickstarts, such as [.NET Web](/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-dotnet-web) for more details on how to get the FusionAuth server up and running.

## Setup the Project

If Visual Studio is not your thing, don't fret. I'll have something for you in a bit. For now, you will head back to Visual Studio. Open it up and select `New Project`.

![Start a new project in Visual Studio](/img/blogs/dotnet-templates/vs-new-project.png)

You should now see the FusionAuth templates as an option to start your project. If you do not see them listed, simply search for `FusionAuth` in the `Search for templates` search bar.

![Select FusionAuth template.](/img/blogs/dotnet-templates/vs-fusionauth-template-select.png)

For this blog, we will select the `FusionAuth ASP.NET MVC Web App`. You will be prompted to enter the name of your project. Once you do that and select `Next`, you will be presented with a window that will allow you to enter the information for your FusionAuth server. If you set up the server using the docker image described above, you will not need to change anything except the `FusionAuth Application Client Secret`. You can update the input with the correct secret by entering `change-this-in-production-to-be-a-real-secret`. If you have another FusionAuth server, you will need to update the inputs with the appropriate information.

![Visual Studio FusionAuth template inputs.](/img/blogs/dotnet-templates/vs-template-inputs.png)

If you are not using Visual Studio and you installed the templates using the NuGet package, you can issue the following command from the Command Prompt in Windows (or Terminal window on a Mac) in an empty directory and it will create the project for you.

```shell
mkdir fusionauth-template-example
cd fusionauth-template-example
dotnet new fusionauthmvcwebapp --client-secret "change-this-in-production-to-be-a-real-secret" --name "MyFusionAuthTestApplication"
```

## It Is Just That Simple

It is just that simple. You now have a fully functioning and secured application. All you need to do is hit the green Start button in Visual Studio. 

Again, if you are not using Visual Studio all you need to do is issue the following command from the same directory the `.csproj` file is in.

```shell
cd MyFusionAuthTestApplication 
dotnet run
```

You can open a browser and go to [https://localhost:5001](https://localhost:5001). Log in using the username `admin@example.com` and the password `password`.

## Alright, Show Me The Code Already

Okay, for some, you have seen all you need to see to start using the new Visual Studio FusionAuth .NET Templates. Please enjoy and feel free to head to the Conclusion section.

For those of you who like to peek under the hood, I have reserved this section for you. Let's dig in.

First things first. Let's take a look at where the values are stored from the inputs you were prompted for when creating the project. Take a look at the `appsettings.json`. There you will find the `Issuer` and `ClientId` that you entered. 

```json
"FusionAuth": {
  "Issuer": "http://localhost:9011",
  "ClientId": "e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e"
}
```

 In the `appsettings.Development.json`, you will find the `ClientSecret` and the Kestrel `Url` that will determine which port the application will run on in development.

```json
"FusionAuth": {
  "ClientSecret": "change-this-in-production-to-be-a-real-secret"
},
"Kestrel": {
  "Endpoints": {
    "Https": {
      "Url": "https://localhost:5001"
    }
  }
}
```

<Aside type="danger">
The client secret is only stored in the `appsettings.Development.json` file for convenient use with the templates. For production environments, you will want to store this in an environmental variable or some other secure manner.
</Aside>

It is also important to know that a reference to the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect` NuGet package has been added to the project.

From here, it is a fairly standard implementation of a MVC application. 

There is a shared layout view `Views\Shared\_Layout.cshtml` which will give you a menu bar across the top and then the body of the page below. 

![The template application home page.](/img/blogs/dotnet-templates/app-homepage.png)

This is also where the logic to display the `Login` link or the `Profile` and `Logout` links in the menu bar is stored.

```html 
<div class="navbar-collapse collapse d-sm-inline-flex justify-content-between">
  @if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
  {
    <ul class="navbar-nav flex-grow-1">
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Index">Home</a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
         <a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Privacy">Privacy</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="navbar-nav ms-auto">
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link text-dark" 
           asp-controller="Account" 
           asp-action="Profile">Profile</a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" 
           asp-controller="Account" 
           asp-action="Logout">Logout</a>
      </li>
     </ul>
  } else {
    <ul class="navbar-nav ms-auto">
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link text-dark"
           asp-area="" 
           asp-controller="Account" 
           asp-action="Login">Login</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  }
 </div>
 ```

If the user is not logged in and clicks the `Login` link, they will be taken to the `AccountController` triggering the `Login` function. This function will take the values in the settings and issue the login dialog for the user.

```c#
public async Task Login(string returnUrl = "/")
  {
    var authenticationProperties = new AuthenticationProperties();
    authenticationProperties.RedirectUri = returnUrl;

    await HttpContext.ChallengeAsync("FusionAuth", authenticationProperties);
  }
```
After the user is authenticated, it redirects them to the homepage again. This time they will be authenticated and will be presented with the `Profile` and `Logout` links.

The `Logout` link will again take the user to the `AccountController` and perform the logout logic.

```c#
public async Task Logout()
{
  var authenticationProperties = new AuthenticationProperties();
  authenticationProperties.RedirectUri = Url.Action("Index", "Home");

  await HttpContext.SignOutAsync("FusionAuth", authenticationProperties);
  await HttpContext.SignOutAsync(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
}
```

The `Profile` link will take to user to the `AccountController` and attempt to return the `Profile` view. Notice the `Authorize` attribute above the function name. This attribute lets the application know not to issue this view unless the user is authenticated.

```c#
[Authorize]
public IActionResult Profile()
{
  return View(User);
}
```

For this template, the `Profile` simply returns some claims. However, in your application, this is where your secured application would start.



## Conclusion
Authentication and Authorization are a critical part of any application. You could create that all from scratch, but it often does not make sense to do so. When you decide to use FusionAuth, you could also create that integration from scratch as demonstrated in many of [FusionAuth's Quickstarts](/docs/quickstarts/). However, you don't need to. The point of the templates is to reduce the amount of time and overhead spent plumbing the application so you can concentrate on creating the parts of it that separate you from your competition. I hope the next time you sit down to write your latest and greatest .NET application you choose to utilize the power of the FusionAuth .NET Templates.
