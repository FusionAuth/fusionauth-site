### ["Best Developer Friendly Auth Solution"](https://www.g2.com/survey_responses/fusionauth-review-7300266)

You can tell it was created with developers in mind because the documentation is top notch and the examples are well written and clear. Also, the support is above and beyond expectation. [Link](https://www.g2.com/products/fusionauth/reviews/fusionauth-review-7300266)

### ["Integrating FusionAuth With A Django Application That Is Already In Production."](https://www.g2.com/survey_responses/fusionauth-review-7924796)

The best thing about FusionAuth is that it provides a way to easily adopt its features incrementally. This is a lifesaver if you are switching authentication services while an application is in production. [Link](https://www.g2.com/products/fusionauth/reviews/fusionauth-review-7924796)
