We're excited to announce FusionAuth's participation in this year's Hacktoberfest! Hacktoberfest is a global event that takes place every Autumn, during which developers are encouraged to contribute to open-source projects like FusionAuth. The goal is to foster a vibrant open-source community, celebrate shared knowledge, and make the world of coding more accessible to all.
