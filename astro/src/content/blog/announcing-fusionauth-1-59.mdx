We're pleased to announce FusionAuth 1.59.0, "The Identity Ibex." This release addresses one of our most-requested features. This version introduces phone numbers as a first-class identity type and passwordless SMS authentication.

## The Problem We're Solving

Not every one of your potential users has an email address readily available, and many people prefer the convenience of phone-based authentication.

Maybe you're building apps for global markets where phone numbers are more accessible than email, developing consumer applications where users expect SMS-based flows, or creating services for populations that primarily use mobile devices. In each of these cases, not supporting phone numbers as an identifier can be a barrier to user adoption.

## Phone-First Authentication

Version 1.59.0 introduces phone number as a first-class identity type, enabling new authentication flows that will let you put mobile users first.

### What You Can Now Do

Phone-Only User Registration

- Users can register using only their phone number with no email required
- Useful for global applications, mobile-first experiences, and markets where phone adoption exceeds email usage
- Streamlines onboarding for users who don't have or don't want to provide email addresses

SMS Passwordless Authentication

- Send secure, one-time codes via SMS to log a user in
- Users authenticate with just their phone number and an SMS code
- Reduces password fatigue while lowering login friction

Flexible Identity Management

- Users can have phone numbers as their sole identifier
- Mix and match email and phone authentication
- One user accessing your application can use SMS login, while another can use the more traditional email login
- Support for users who want both email and phone options

### How It Works

Phone authentication in FusionAuth follows the same security principles as our email workflows:

1. Registration: Users provide their phone number during registration
2. Verification: FusionAuth sends an SMS with a verification code
3. Authentication: Users can log in using passwordless SMS flows
4. Recovery: Account recovery can happen via SMS instead of email

All existing FusionAuth features (MFA, user management, advanced threat detection) work with phone-based identities.

### API Integration

Phone authentication is fully supported through our APIs, so you can integrate it into your existing workflows and automation. Check out our updated [API documentation](/docs/apis) for detailed implementation guides.

## Additional Improvements in 1.59.0

Beyond the phone authentication features, this release includes security improvements and quality of life updates:

### Security Enhancements

- Cross-Site Scripting Protection: Additional safeguards against XSS attacks
- Injection Attack Prevention: Protections against malicious injection attempts
- Generic Messenger Error Handling: Better user feedback when message delivery fails

### User Experience Improvements

- Optional Passwords: Users can now exist without passwords, supporting passwordless-only and federated-only authentication
- JWT Flexibility: The value of the exp claim can now be decreased (but not increased) in JWT Populate lambdas, allowing for more complicated token expiration rules
- Longer Password Hash Support: Increased password hash limit from 255 to 2048 characters for easier imports

### Developer Experience

- Error Handling: More descriptive error messages for invalid API inputs
- Event Logging: Failed message delivery now generates event logs for troubleshooting
- Scope Availability: The scope claim is now available in JWT Populate lambdas

## Technical Notes

This release includes significant architectural changes to support phone numbers as first-class identity types. The database schema includes substantial changes to accommodate phone-based workflows while maintaining backward compatibility with existing email-based systems.

**Database Migration Notes**:

- Large installations may experience several minutes of downtime during migration
- For Kubernetes deployments, configure startup probes to accommodate migration time

**Theme Updates Required**: If you're using custom themes, you'll need to update them to support users without passwords. The changes enable proper rendering of authentication flows for passwordless-only users.

## What's Next

Phone-first authentication provides a foundation for mobile-first identity management. This sets the stage for future enhancements like regional SMS provider optimizations, advanced phone number validation, and additional phone-based authentication options.

## Get Started Today
