The FusionAuth team is hitting the road to connect with you at three major industry events. We're bringing real-world expertise on single-tenant architecture, containerized deployments, and migration strategies that don't force you to reset user passwords.

## devcom Developer Conference

### August 17-19, 2025 in Cologne, Germany

At devcom, we'll dive deep into the technical decisions that matter to you and your team. Swing by our booth for a demo, or talk to us about the architecture choices that determine whether your auth system scales or becomes a bottleneck.

Ask us about…

- How single-tenant architecture eliminates the "noisy neighbor" problem that plagues multi-tenant auth solutions
- Containerized deployment strategies that integrate directly into your CI/CD pipeline
- Migration approaches that preserve existing user data without forcing password resets

### Find us at Booth D6 or [schedule your 1 on 1 time](https://calendly.com/events-fusionauth/devcom?month=2025-08)

## gamescom 2025

### August 20-24, 2025 in Cologne, Germany

Gaming platforms face unique authentication challenges: massive user spikes during launches, complex social features, and the need for customizable login experiences that match your brand. At gamescom, we'll be showing how FusionAuth handles the scale and customization requirements that gaming companies face.

Talk to us about…

- Handling seasonal traffic spikes without breaking your budget
- Custom user registration flows that enhance player onboarding
- B2C authentication that scales from indie studios to major publishers
- Integration strategies for game engines and backend services

Whether you're building multiplayer experiences, social gaming features, or player progression systems, our team will show you how to implement authentication that enhances gameplay rather than complicating it.

### See us at Booth B-41 or [schedule time to talk](https://calendly.com/events-fusionauth/gamescom)

## AWS Summit Los Angeles

### Sept. 17, 2025 in Los Angeles, California

If you're running on AWS or planning a cloud migration, authentication architecture becomes even more critical. At the [AWS Summit](/event/aws-summit-los-angeles), we'll be focused on how FusionAuth's deployment flexibility gives you options that other CIAM providers simply can't offer.

Some topics you might want to discuss…

- Take Control of Authentication: Discover how FusionAuth gives you complete ownership and customization over your customer login experience, rather than relying on black-box solutions.
- Scale Securely on AWS: Learn directly from the experts how FusionAuth integrates seamlessly with AWS, providing a robust and scalable CIAM (Customer Identity and Access Management) solution for your applications.
- Boost Developer Efficiency: See how FusionAuth's developer-friendly platform can drastically reduce the time and resources your team spends on authentication, letting them focus on core product features.

This is especially relevant for teams dealing with data sovereignty requirements or those who need their authentication system to be part of their core infrastructure rather than a black-box SaaS dependency.

What makes these events valuable?

- Direct access to our technical team, not just sales representatives
- Hands-on demonstrations
- Architecture discussions tailored to your use case
- Clear migration paths from your current solution

## Connect With the FusionAuth Team

If you're attending any of these events, we'd love to discuss your authentication challenges and show you how FusionAuth's approach differs from traditional CIAM providers. Our team includes engineers who understand the complexities of modern application architecture and can speak directly to the technical decisions you're facing.

Can't make it to these events? Our Solutions Engineering team is always available for proof-of-concept discussions and architecture reviews. Whether you're evaluating alternatives to your current authentication provider or planning a migration from homegrown auth, we're here to help you make decisions based on your actual requirements, not vendor marketing.

Ready to see what authentication looks like when it's built for engineering teams? Connect with us at any of these events or [reach out directly](/contact) to start a technical discussion about your specific use case.
