In our previous post, [Announcing FusionAuth 1.59.0 - The Identity Ibex](/blog/announcing-fusionauth-1-59), you explored the shift towards separate Email and Phone Identities. This was a foundational change, but it still largely followed the "Register first, Verify later" pattern. 

With the release of FusionAuth 1.62.0, FusionAuth introduced a powerful new capability: **Identity Verification** (also known as Pre-Verification). This allows you to verify a User's Identity *before* they are created in your system.

## Why Do You Want Identity Verification?

Identity Verification is a game-changer for maintaining a clean and secure User database. Here are the primary reasons you might want to implement it:

- **No User creation before the Identity is verified**: In traditional flows, a User record is created immediately upon form submission, even if the Email or Phone number is never verified. This leads to a database full of "zombie" accounts. Identity Verification ensures that a User record is only created *after* proof of ownership is established.
- **Avoiding wrong or spam User creation**: Bots and malicious actors often use fake or stolen Identities to create Accounts. By requiring Verification as part of the Registration flow itself, you prevent these Accounts from ever being provisioned.
- **Avoid blocking Identities from being verified because of falsely started Registration flows**: Have you ever tried to sign up for a service, only to be told your Email is already in use because you (or someone else with a typo) started a Registration months ago and never finished it? Identity Verification keeps the Identity "unclaimed" until the Verification is successful, preventing these collisions.

## What Is Required For Identity Verification?

To get started with built-in Identity Verification in FusionAuth, you'll need the following:

- **FusionAuth 1.62.0**: Ensure you are running the latest version to access these features.
- **A Licensed Paid Plan**: While basic Verification is available to all, enforcing Pre-Verification via Advanced Registration Forms is a premium feature.
- **Messaging Configuration**: You must have a configured SMTP server for Email or a Messenger (like Twilio) for SMS Verification.
- **Tenant Identities Enabled**: In your Tenant settings under the <Breadcrumb>Identities</Breadcrumb> tab, you must enable "Verify identity" for either Email or Phone.
- **Advanced Registration Form**: You'll need to create a Form that includes a **Verification** step between the Identity collection step (e.g., Email) and the final Account creation step (e.g., password).

## What Does Identity Verification Not Solve?

While Identity Verification is a robust tool, it's important to understand its boundaries:

- **It verifies ownership, not "truth"**: It confirms the User has access to the Email or Phone number. It doesn't verify their real-world Identity (like a government Id or credit check).
- **Bot prevention (partially)**: While it stops bots from creating Accounts, it doesn't stop them from triggering Verification messages. You should still use CAPTCHA or rate limiting to prevent SMS/Email pumping.

## Setting Up Identity Verification

To enable Pre-Verification, you will need to configure your messaging, update your Tenant settings, and create an Advanced Registration Form.

### 1. Configure Messaging

Identity Verification requires a way to send codes or links to your Users.

*   **Email**: Navigate to <Breadcrumb>Tenants -> Your Tenant -> Email</Breadcrumb> and configure your SMTP settings. Ensure a test Email is delivered successfully.
*   **Phone**: Navigate to <Breadcrumb>Settings -> Messengers</Breadcrumb> and add a Messenger (such as Twilio). Then, go to <Breadcrumb>Tenants -> Your Tenant -> Identities</Breadcrumb> and select your Messenger in the "Messaging settings" section.

### 2. Enable Tenant Identity Verification

Once messaging is configured, you must enable Verification for the Identity types you wish to use.

1. Navigate to <Breadcrumb>Tenants -> Edit Tenant -> Identities</Breadcrumb>.
2. In the "Identity verification settings" section for either **Email** or **Phone**:
    *   Enable "Verify identity".
    *   Select the appropriate template (`Email Verification` or `Phone Verification`).
    *   Set "Unverified behavior" to `Gated`.

### 3. Create An Advanced Registration Form

Verification is enforced through an [Advanced Registration Form](/docs/lifecycle/register-users/advanced-registration-forms).

First, ensure that the Identity field is mandatory. Navigate to <Breadcrumb>Customizations -> Form Fields</Breadcrumb> and verify that `user.email` or `user.phoneNumber` has "Required" set to `true`.

    Identity Verification only works with the `user.email` and `user.phoneNumber` Form Fields. Do not use custom fields as they are not Identity types.
</Aside>

Next, create the Form by navigating to <Breadcrumb>Customizations -> Forms</Breadcrumb>:

*   **Step 1**: Add the Identity field ("Email address" or "Phone number").
*   **Step 2**: Add a **Verification** step, selecting the corresponding Verification type.
*   **Step 3**: Add any other required fields, such as "First Name".
*   **Step 4**: Always add the "Password" field as the final step.

### 4. Enable Self-Service Registration

Finally, link the Form to your Application. Navigate to <Breadcrumb>Applications -> Your Application -> Registration</Breadcrumb>:

1. Enable "Self-service registration".
2. Set the "Registration type" to `Advanced`.
3. Select your new Form in the "Advanced Registration Form" dropdown.

<Aside type="note" nodark="true">
    Application Registration Verification is deprecated. When using Identity Pre-Verification, do not enable Registration Verification on the Application. Use Advanced Registration Forms with a Verification step instead.
</Aside>

## A Kickstart Example

Setting up Identity Verification can be done entirely via [Kickstart](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/kickstart), making it easy to replicate across environments. FusionAuth Kickstart is a declarative tool that allows you to automate the setup of your FusionAuth instance.

The example `kickstart.json` template provided for this project does more than just enable Verification; it bootstraps a complete working environment. At a high level, it:

1. **Creates Email Templates**: tbd
2. **Creates Message Templates**: tbd
3. **Configures Email**: Enables SMTP with Mailcatcher as a receiver.
4. **Defines Form Fields**: Creates mandatory `user.email` and `user.phoneNumber` fields.
5. **Creates an Advanced Registration Form**: Builds a custom Registration Form.
6. **Configures the Application**: 
    - Enables Self-Service Registration with the `Advanced` type.
    - Associates the custom Form.
7. **Provisions Users**: Creates both an administrative User and a test User, pre-registering them to their respective Applications.

By implementing Identity Verification, you're not just verifying an Email; you're ensuring that every User in your system has a proven Identity from day one.
