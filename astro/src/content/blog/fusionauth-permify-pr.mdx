**DENVER, CO – November 20, 2025 -** FusionAuth, the deploy anywhere, developer-first Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) platform, today announced its acquisition of Permify, the leading open-source fine-grained authorization service.

With this acquisition, FusionAuth is the first platform to unite authentication (AuthN) and authorization (AuthZ) in a single, self-hostable architecture, giving organizations complete ownership and control of their identity infrastructure.

## Full Control is the New Security Posture

Identity has become the primary attack surface and many organizations are looking for ways to reduce dependency on third-party SaaS providers. At the same time, modern applications, especially those introducing AI-based or agent-driven features, require more precise, contextual authorization that traditional tools provide.

Fine-grained authorization (FGA) is increasingly essential for keeping autonomous workflows safe and governed. By combining FGA inside one deploy-anywhere platform, FusionAuth delivers an identity solution built for this new era of control, transparency, and security.

“We chose Permify because their technology perfectly complements our mission to give our customers control”, said Brian Bell, CEO at FusionAuth. “This isn’t just an acquisition, it’s the next evolution of our story. As AI-driven and agent-based systems become more common, organizations need deeper, more precise authorization. By combining Permify’s fine-grained authorization with our deploy-anywhere platform, we’re giving organizations something no one else can – complete ownership of who users are, what they can do, and where that logic lives.”

## Full Ownership Meets Fine-Grained Authorization

Permify brings a modern, relationship-based authorization engine that enables precise, resource-level access control at scale. Once integrated with FusionAuth, customers will be able to manage the entire identity lifecycle, authentication, user management, and fine-grained permissions, from one unified platform.

Immediate benefits include:

- **Unified Identity & Permission Layer:** One platform for the full identity and authorization lifecycle.
- **Decoupled & Scalable Authorization:** Centralized access policies across services, ensuring consistent enforcement and effortless scalability for even the most complex applications.
- **Open Source Commitment:** FusionAuth is committed to maintaining and expanding Permify’s thriving open-source community, ensuring the technology remains accessible, transparent, and collaborative.

FusionAuth will launch the unified product and updated pricing model in 2026, reflecting the expanded value of a truly integrated authentication and authorization platform.

## A Shared Commitment to Open Source and Community

FusionAuth and Permify share a deep commitment to openness, developer empowerment, and community involvement. FusionAuth will continue to support and grow the Permify open-source ecosystem, ensuring that developers worldwide can use, contribute to, and extend the technology.

This aligns with FusionAuth’s long-standing investment in free community tools, documentation, and a deploy-anywhere model that gives developers full control of their identity stack. Together, FusionAuth and Permify will continue to champion open-source collaboration and freedom of choice for builders everywhere.

“Developers and developer experience are at the core of both FusionAuth and Permify. FusionAuth is self-hosted and API-first, so it’s a natural step for us to support, maintain, and continue to develop Permify as OSS authorization,” said Kim Maida, Head of Developer Relations at FusionAuth. We look forward to working with the Permify community and contributing to the Identity and Access Management OSS ecosystem.”
