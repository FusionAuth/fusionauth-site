Let's see what FusionAuth users had to say:

>"FusionAuth's feature set is hard to beat - it really is an all-in-one auth solution. We particularly appreciate the themeable multi-tenant aspect to FusionAuth, the full OAuth 2 support, and the built-in registration, login, and forgot password flows. The admin console makes it easy to get started, but FusionAuth's API-first approach and excellent documentation have made it a breeze to automate tasks once we've got them working via the admin console. To top it all off we love that we can self-host FusionAuth and maintain full control over our user data. We've been doing this via Docker and have had very few problems." **- Elliot D, Founder, Treefort Systems**

>"A great authentication solution for our SaaS development. The product is well-developed and supported, the documentation is excellent, and it is easy to implement. The feature set is tremendous for our needs. Implementing the other products I have used is far simpler and way more cost-effective." **- Robert L, CTO**

>"Well-designed, complete out-of-the-box experience." **- Aaron H, Senior Full-Stack Developer**

>"Finding an easy-to-use yet powerful auth system is challenging. But FusionAuth provides this effortlessly and inexpensively. After discovering FusionAuth, creating our first demo took just a few hours. After that promising demo, we dove deep into the FusionAuth white papers and API docs to bring Circleboom Login to live.
>
>From my previous experience with other identity providers, I can easily say it saved more than a couple of man/months and tens of thousands of dollars." **- Atakan E, CTO, Circleboom**
