You shouldn’t have to choose between compliance and functionality when your applications serve users across multiple countries. Today we’re proud to announce that FusionAuth has achieved [Data Privacy Framework (DPF)](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/program-articles/Benefits-of-the-Data-Privacy-Framework-(DPF)-Program) certification. This provides engineering teams with straightforward compliance requirements for cross-border personal data transfers involving the US, EU, UK, and Switzerland.

## **What This Means for Your Auth Architecture**

We know that FusionAuth customers come from every part of the world. We’ve always maintained robust data protection, helping to keep your data safe and your business compliant. The DPF certification demonstrates our continued dedication to protecting user data.

Engineering teams building applications with international user bases often face a critical decision point: how do you handle authentication and user data across jurisdictions without creating operational complexity?

Traditional approaches require:

- Complex multi-region deployments with data residency controls
- Limiting market reach to avoid compliance complexity
- Building custom compliance infrastructure that diverts engineering resources

FusionAuth's DPF certification provides a third option: use a certified authentication platform that handles compliance while maintaining flexibility.

**What This Means for Your Team:**

- **Simplified cross-border data handling** - No need to build complex data residency solutions for basic compliance
- **Reduced legal overhead** - Built-in mechanisms for data protection complaints and independent dispute resolution
- **Development velocity** - Focus on building features instead of compliance infrastructure
- **Future-proof architecture** - Established framework that evolves with regulatory changes

**What’s Covered and When?**

The Data Privacy Framework certification covers FusionAuth's entire data processing lifecycle:

**Data Collection and Processing**

- Personal data handling aligned with GDPR Article 6 lawful basis
- Automated data retention and deletion capabilities
- Built-in consent management for user data processing

**Cross-Border Transfer Mechanisms**

- Automated compliance documentation for audit requirements
- Transparent data processing notifications

**User Rights and Protections**

- External complaint resolution procedures through established frameworks

With FusionAuth's DPF certification, these requirements are handled automatically, letting your team concentrate on building your product.
