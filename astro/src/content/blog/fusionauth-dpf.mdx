You shouldn’t have to choose between compliance and functionality when your applications serve users across multiple countries. Today we’re proud to announce that FusionAuth has achieved [Data Privacy Framework (DPF)](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/program-articles/Benefits-of-the-Data-Privacy-Framework-(DPF)-Program) certification. This helps us to provide engineering teams with a clear path to handling personal data transfers between the US, EU, UK, and Switzerland.

## **What This Means for Your Auth Architecture**

We know that FusionAuth customers come from every part of the world. We’ve always maintained robust data protection, helping to keep your data safe and your business compliant. The DPF certification is a testament to, and verification of, the work that we’ve done.

Engineering teams building applications with international user bases often face a critical decision point: How do you handle authentication and user data across jurisdictions without creating operational complexity?

Traditional approaches require:

- Complex multi-region deployments with data residency controls
- Limiting market reach to avoid compliance complexity
- Building custom compliance infrastructure that diverts engineering resources

FusionAuth's DPF certification provides a third option: leverage a certified authentication platform that handles the compliance complexity while maintaining the flexibility you need.

**What this means for your team:**

- **Simplified cross-border data handling** - No need to architect complex data residency solutions for basic compliance
- **Reduced legal overhead** - Built-in mechanisms for data protection complaints and external consumer protections
- **Maintained development velocity** - Focus on building features instead of compliance infrastructure
- **Future-proof architecture** - Established framework that evolves with regulatory changes

**What’s Covered and When?**

The Data Privacy Framework certification covers FusionAuth's entire data processing lifecycle:

**Data Collection and Processing**

- Personal data handling aligned with GDPR Article 6 lawful bases
- Automated data retention and deletion capabilities
- Built-in consent management for user data processing

**Cross-Border Transfer Mechanisms**

- Certified adequacy for EU-US, UK-US, and Swiss-US data transfers
- Automated compliance documentation for audit requirements
- Transparent data processing notifications

**User Rights and Protections**

- Standardized processes for data subject access requests
- Automated mechanisms for data portability and deletion
- External complaint resolution procedures through established frameworks

With FusionAuth's DPF certification, these requirements are handled automatically through the certified framework, letting your team concentrate on building the features that differentiate your product.
