FusionAuth, the authentication and authorization platform built for developers, today announced Enterprise Kubernetes Support. Building on Kubernetes is a solid foundation for microservices and other modern architectures, but in today’s zero trust environments, developer teams still need a way to ensure that access is limited to authorized users and services. By deploying FusionAuth into their Kubernetes clusters, teams have an API-first, developer friendly identity provider for all their credentials and token management needs.

"Like everything we do at FusionAuth, we approached supporting Kubernetes with the developer at the forefront of our mind. We worked with our community to understand what they needed from an auth solution in Kubernetes, then delivered it," said Brian Pontarelli, CTO at FusionAuth. "FusionAuth is self-hosted, giving developers a tremendous amount of control and power, but we deploy like a SaaS offering – quickly and efficiently. There’s no need for making things in Kube more complicated than they need to be. With our new Kubernetes support, developers can set up and configure auth in an app in minutes."
 
Kubernetes continues to be the go-to choice for container orchestration platforms, [with 78% of companies](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2020/6/kubernetes-statistics-2020) polled by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation using it. Despite its popularity amongst enterprises, Kubernetes is notoriously complex. Adding authorization and authentication services within it is often more work than DevSecOps teams have the bandwidth or expertise for.

"We have a Kubernetes set up for our platform and the integration of FusionAuth via the helm chart is just a breeze. Together with [FusionAuth Kickstart](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/kickstart), we can launch new dedicated FusionAuth instances completely automated," said Cyrill Lippuner, CTO at Aposphere. "Further, it can run completely in a private network without needing cloud access, which is a big plus on the privacy side."

FusionAuth’s Kubernetes support is turn-key, with minimal configuration and no coding required. For more on using FusionAuth in Kubernetes, visit [/kubernetes/](/kubernetes/).
