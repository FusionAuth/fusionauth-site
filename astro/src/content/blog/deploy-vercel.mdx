You've made changes to your web app, tested those changes, and merged the changes into your main GitHub branch. But that's usually just the start. Now you need to build and deploy to production.

{/* more */}

That's where Vercel can help. It's a cloud platform that enables you to deploy and host websites and web applications, with a particular focus on frontend frameworks, such as Next.js. You can manually deploy your app from Vercel, or better still use your source-code-control system to make the deploy request for you.

The Vercel app is known for:
* Instant deployment: With a little configuration, Vercel builds and deploys your site each time you commit changes in GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
* Serverless architecture: You don't need to manage servers as Vercel does it for you.
* Global Content Delivery Network (CDN): Your site loads quickly because copies are distributed around the world.

Vercel is especially popular among React and Next.js developers, but it also supports other frameworks like Vue, Svelte, and plain HTML/CSS/JS.

## Setup

To follow this tutorial you need:

* A Vercel account
* A Github, GitLab or Bitbucket account (this tutorial uses GitHub)
* A registered domain name and the ability to modify DNS settings
* A fork of the example GitHub repository (explained later)
* A working instance of FusionAuth

### Fork The Example Repository

To focus on configuring Vercel, you'll fork a GitHub repository that contains the code for the example used in this blog. The repository contains:

* Code for the Vue.js application configured to use FusionAuth
* A GitHub action that works with Vercel to deploy the application on committed changes

You must fork the repository instead of cloning so that you can make changes to the repository and run the Github actions. Also, detach the fork to prevent accidentally committing changes back to the repository for this blog.

To fork and detach the repository:

1. Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to the [FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-vercel-vue-deploy](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-vercel-vue-deploy).
2. Click on <InlineUIElement>Fork</InlineUIElement> and then click <InlineUIElement>Create Fork</InlineUIElement> on the page that opens. GitHub creates and then opens your new repository with the fork.
3. Open the <InlineUIElement>Settings</InlineUIElement> tab for the forked repository.
4. Scroll down to the section titled <InlineField>Danger Zone</InlineField> and click <InlineUIElement>Leave fork network</InlineUIElement>. A popover window appears.
5. Click <InlineUIElement>I have read and understand these effects</InlineUIElement>. A confirmation window appears.
6. Enter the name of the repository that's shown in the confirmation popover and then click <InlineUIElement>Leave fork network</InlineUIElement>.

Use this repository for the rest of the blog.

<Aside type='note'>
The example in this tutorial uses the domain `codegremlins.net`. When you see that name, replace it with your domain. For example, your domain is `myowndomain.com` and the step shows `auth.codegremlins.net`, replace it with `auth.myowndomain.com`.
</Aside>

## Create a Vercel Project

In this section you create a Vercel project that's connected to a GitHub repository. The following steps assume that Vercel isn't already connected to your GitHub account.

1. Log in to your Vercel account and navigate to the Overview tab if it's not already open.
2. Click <InlineUIElement>Add New..</InlineUIElement> and choose <InlineUIElement>Project</InlineUIElement>.
3. In the section titled <InlineField>Import Git Repository</InlineField> click  <InlineUIElement>Continue with GitHub</InlineUIElement>.
4. Vercel requests permission to verify your GitHub identity. Select <InlineUIElement>Authorize Vercel</InlineUIElement>.
5. Vercel requests that you install it into your GitHub account. Select <InlineUIElement>Install</InlineUIElement>. A popover window appears. Select <InlineUIElement>Only select repositories</InlineUIElement> and choose the repository you forked during the [setup](#setup).
6. Click  <InlineUIElement>Install</InlineUIElement> and then click <InlineUIElement>Import</InlineUIElement>.

![Install Vercel to your GitHub repository.](/img/blogs/vercel-deploy/vercel-install.png)

Vercel needs two more pieces of information before it can deploy your app:

* Select `Vue.js` on the <InlineField>Framework Preset</InlineField> menu.
* Click the Edit button next to the Root Directory field, enter `complete-application`, and click <InlineUIElement>Save </InlineUIElement>.

You can now deploy your application manually: click <InlineUIElement>Deploy</InlineUIElement>. 

![Vercel project settings screen.](/img/blogs/vercel-deploy/vercel-project-settings.png)

The text in the <InlineUIElement>Deploy</InlineUIElement> button changes to an animated wait cursor. Once it's deployed, you'll see a Congratulations message and a screenshot of your application.

Return to the dashboard by clicking <InlineUIElement>Continue to Dashboard</InlineUIElement>.

## Create A Friendlier URL For Your Deployed Application

The URL for your deployed app is generated by Vercel using their domain. You'd prefer a URL that uses your domain and an appropriate app name. To do that, first specify the URl for your app in Vercel:

1. Click <InlineUIElement>Domains</InlineUIElement> on the Vercel dashboard for your project. The domain settings page opens.

![Vercel Domains button.](/img/blogs/vercel-deploy/vercel-domains.png)

2. Click <InlineUIElement>Add Domain</InlineUIElement>. A popover window appears.
3. Enter the desired domain name in the domain name text box of the <InlineField>Add Domain</InlineField> section. This tutorial uses `changebank.codegremlins.net`, you'll enter `changebank.{your-domain}`. Accept the value of `Production` for the `Connect to an environment` field.
4. Click <InlineUIElement>Save</InlineUIElement>.
5. Leave the DNS settings request screen open during the next part.

Although this assigns a new domain name to your app, it isn't one that works. Entering that URL into a browser results in a page not found error. This is because the app doesn't exist on your own domain name service (DNS) provider, and that provider doesn't know to check Vercel. To fix that add a `CNAME` record to your domain that knows to check Vercel for the ChangeBank app.

![Vercel DNS settings request.](/img/blogs/vercel-deploy/vercel-dns-settings.png)

The specific directions for adding a `CNAME` record depend on your provider. Once you've added the record, return to the DNS Settings request screen in Vercel. Refresh the status as needed until Vercel shows that the configuration is working. This may take some time as the change from your provider must propagate across other providers.

Verify that everything is working correctly by visiting your app at the `changebank` URL you specified.

## Setup Automatic Deployment

Currently you deploy your app manually. The next step is to configure GitHub to automatically request deployment when you commit changes to the main branch. The repository already contains the code for a GitHub action to do this: `.github/workflows/deploy-to-vercel.yml`. What's missing are the values for the script: the ID for your project (`VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`), your organization (`VERCEL_ORG_ID`), and credentials to connect to Vercel (`VERCEL_TOKEN`).

### Find Your Project ID

Click on the Vercel logo in the top-left corner of the page and then select your project. Open the settings for your project and make a note of your <InlineField>Project ID</InlineField>.

### Find Your Org ID

Open your account settings by clicking on your user icon in the top-right corner of the Vercel page and click <InlineUIElement>Account Settings</InlineUIElement>. Select <InlineUIElement>General</InlineUIElement> on the left of the settings page, and then scroll down until the <InlineField>User ID</InlineField> is visible. Make note of the ID and keep it somewhere safe.

### Generate A Connection Token

Open your Vercel account settings by clicking on your user icon in the top-right corner of the Vercel page. Once on the settings page:

1. Select <InlineUIElement>Tokens</InlineUIElement> on the left-hand side.
2. In the <InlineField>Create Token</InlineField> area configure fields as follows:
    1. Enter “Changebank App” into the <InlineField>Token Name</InlineField>.
    2. Select your account for the <InlineField>Scope</InlineField>.
    3. Set the <InlineField>Expiration Date</InlineField> to sometime in the future. Normally the value you use is based on your security requirements.
3. Click <InlineUIElement>Create</InlineUIElement> to create the token.
4. Copy the information for the token as you'll enter that later. Keep the information safe and secure.
5. Click <InlineUIElement>Done</InlineUIElement>.


### Add The Secrets To GitHub

Next you'll add the three secrets to your GitHub repository with the pieces of Vercel information. First, open the GitHub area for entering repository secrets for Actions:

1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. Select the repository for your version of this app.
3. Click <InlineUIElement>Settings</InlineUIElement> and then click <InlineUIElement>Secrets and variables</InlineUIElement>.
4. Click <InlineUIElement>Actions</InlineUIElement>.

Now, for each of the three secrets: `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, and `VERCEL_TOKEN`:

1. Click <InlineUIElement>New repository secret</InlineUIElement>.
2. Enter the name of the secret in the <InlineField>Name</InlineField>.
3. Enter the value for the secret in the <InlineField>Secret</InlineField>.
4. Click <InlineUIElement>Add secret</InlineUIElement>.

### Enable Repository Actions

The final step to enable automatic deployment is to turn on the GitHub actions for the repository. This enables execution of the deploy script in the `.github/workflows` directory.

1. Open the Settings pane for your GitHub repository.
2. Click <InlineUIElement>Actions</InlineUIElement> in Code and Automation to expand the menu item and then click <InlineUIElement>General</InlineUIElement>.
3. Enable actions for the repository and then select <InlineUIElement>Allow all actions and reusable workflows</InlineUIElement> in the Actions permissions section.

## Configure FusionAuth For Your Application

Finally, you will need to update some values in the application to point to your instance of FusionAuth. You will commit the changes to the repository and the updated application will be automatically deployed.

1. Open the `main.ts` file located in the `complete-application/src` folder in your code editor.
2. For each of the four keys: `clientId`, `serverUrl`, `redirectUri`, and `postLogoutRedirectUri` update the values for your FusionAuth instance. The default settings for these values in the forked repository are:
    1. <InlineField>clientId</InlineField> - `ec526002-35cc-4e6e-8f5b-0e4fba2b08c8` - This is the application Id in FusionAuth.
    2. <InlineField>serverUrl</InlineField> - `https://auth.codegremlins.net` - This is the URL of your FusionAuth instance.
    3. <InlineField>redirectUri</InlineField> - `https://changebank.codegremlins.net` - This is the URL of your Changebank application.
    4. <InlineField>postLogoutRedirectUri</InlineField> - `https://changebank.codegremlins.net` - This is the URL to return the user to after they log out. In this case, it is the same as the application itself.
3. Commit the changes to GitHub.

You can now click on the <InlineUIElement>Actions</InlineUIElement> tab in your repository. Here you view the status of the action created by your commit. If everything is configured correctly an action starts and then completes successfully. If you run into errors, double check your values.

## Verify The Application Has Deployed

Log into Vercel and check out the main page for the project. You should see the <InlineField>Created</InlineField> date and it should be within the last few minutes. You can click on the URL and see your newly deployed application.

## Next Steps

And just like that, with a push to GitHub, your humble little app is live on Vercel, complete with authentication and dangerously close to being mistaken for a production app. This is a basic tutorial on how to deploy an application to Vercel using FusionAuth as the authentication provider. However, before you start sending out press releases and quitting your day job, a word of caution: deploying straight to production is like skydiving without a backup parachute—it's exhilarating until it isn't. If you're planning on adding new features (or “breaking things” as we call it in tech), you might want to set up [custom environments](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/environments) in Vercel. That way, you can deploy to development or preview environments first, make sure everything still works.

[Custom environments](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/environments) allow you to set up GitHub actions for each environment. For example, you may want each branch of your repository to have its own environment or set up a test environment to deploy to before you deploy to production.

In the end, deploying a FusionAuth-secured app to Vercel is as easy as git push, however staying sane in production? Well, that's another story. Happy coding, and may your auth tokens never expire at the worst possible moment!
