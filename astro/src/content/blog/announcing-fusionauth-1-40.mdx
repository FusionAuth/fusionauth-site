We're excited to announce the release of FusionAuth version 1.40.0. It shipped on Sep 16, 2022. This release includes native windows installation, Okta SCIM support for deactivation of users, and a change to how you can install the MySQL driver, as well as other bug fixes.

There are a number of new features, enhancements, and bug fixes. As always, please see the [release notes](/docs/release-notes/archive#version-1-40-0) for a full breakdown of the changes between 1.39 and 1.40, including any schema changes.

There were 6 issues, enhancements, and bug fixes included in this release. Read more about all the changes in the [release notes](/docs/release-notes/archive#version-1-40-0).

While this was a smaller release, are a couple of changes worth calling out.

## Native Windows installs

In version 1.37, we removed our native Windows installation support. We figured that people installing on Windows would be able to use the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and use our [Debian or RPM packages](/direct-download).

We were wrong. Sorry about that!

Our community and customers let us know that they needed native windows installation and that the WSL option was not workable for everyone.

As of this release, FusionAuth can be installed on Windows just as it was pre 1.37.

## Enhanced SCIM support

The SCIM support in FusionAuth continues to improve. With this release, deactivation of users works with Okta systems.

In particular, Okta updates users via `PUT` or `PATCH`, setting `active` to `false` when they are deactivated.

As of this release, receiving this message from a SCIM client will deactivate the user in FusionAuth.

## MySQL database driver download changes

If you are using MySQL or plan to use MySQL as the database for your FusionAuth installation, you will need to manually download the JDBC connector and place it in the correct location of your FusionAuth installation. This is required for FusionAuth to connect to any MySQL database.

If you are using PostgreSQL, this change does not affect you.

See [the installation guide](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/database#install-mysql-connector) for additional information and instructions.

We apologize in advance for any inconvenience this causes you. Unfortunately, the Oracle GPL licensing makes it difficult for FusionAuth to easily deliver the JDBC driver, requiring this action on your part.

## Upgrade at will

The [release notes](/docs/release-notes/archive#version-1-40-0) are a guide to the changes, fixes, and new features. Please read them carefully to see if any features you use have been modified or enhanced.
