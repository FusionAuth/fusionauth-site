## Security considerations

This workflow is a secure methods of authenticating users. It uses a JWT and refresh token that are securely store on the mobile device. One downside is that the application backend receives passwords from the browser. While this isn't an issue if TLS is used and the passwords are not stored by the application backend, developers that do not want to be part of the password chain of responsibility should consider other workflows.

## APIs used

Here are the FusionAuth APIs used in this example:

* [/api/login](/docs/v1/tech/apis/login#authenticate-a-user)
* [/api/jwt/refresh](/docs/v1/tech/apis/jwt#refresh-a-jwt)
* [/oauth2/token](/docs/v1/tech/oauth/endpoints#refresh-token-grant-request)
