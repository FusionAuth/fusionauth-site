Single sign-on (SSO) is a crucial aspect of any customer identity and access management (CIAM) strategy.

Why do you need an SSO? 

Your organization typically has more than one customer-facing application. Even if you start with one custom application, SaaS tools such as support forums, ticketing systems, or chat tools require your customers to log in. SSO can minimize how many times a customer can log in.

Integrating SSO into your applications means your users can access all their applications with one set of credentials, such as a username and password, a magic link, or a WebAuthn passkey.

Offering this functionality allows you to have one view of the user, which is ideal for security and data consistency. 

SSO allows users to minimize the time spent getting into your applications and maximize the time spent using them.

## An SSO Scenario

Let's say you have two applications for which you want to enable SSO:

* The Pied Piper Video Chat application (PPVC)
* The Hooli Jobs application (they're always hiring)

You want to enable users to log in to the PPVC, and then, if they visit Hooli to apply for a job, have them automatically sign in to the Hooli Jobs application. 

You can have more than two applications behave this way.

This pattern scales to any number of applications and can include commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) apps that support OIDC (OpenID Connect) or SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language).

If you have a suite of applications, SSO can provide a seamless authentication experience for your users across the entire set of apps. For example, Google Suite includes various applications that leverage the SSO functionality. Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, and more are entirely different applications running on different servers, however, you can bounce among these apps without having to re-authenticate yourself.

How does SSO work? 

This article will dive into this, but first, let's talk about sessions.

## Sessions

Sessions are HTTP-based servers "know" they've seen a client before. Sessions are typically implemented using cookies whenever the application is browser-based.

In the SSO scenario above, the following sessions exist:

* The PPVC application's session
* The Hooli Jobs application's session
* The identity provider's session

If a session doesn't exist for a given application or isn't valid, then the session must be created or updated. This happens after the user has presented valid credentials and been authenticated.

For the other applications in this example, the credential, which proves authentication has occurred, is a valid token.

## Single Sign-on Request Flow

The OIDC single sign-on flow is described below.

The home page of each application is unavailable to anonymous users. When a browser requests a user to log in, they are directed to the identity provider to authenticate. However, the authentication of the identity provider happens only once.

<SSOLogin alt={"Single sign-on request flow during login."} />

(If you are a stickler, you'll notice there is no request for a token from the apps to the identity provider after the user authenticates. That is implied and required.)

With SSO there are different sessions managed by different applications, which can have varying lifetimes and storage mechanisms.

The PPVC and Hooli Jobs applications delegate authentication to the single sign-on provider, and build their sessions on the foundation of the identity provider's session. That session is, in turn, tied to a user authentication event.

The requirements for implementing single sign-on are:

* A browser that respects redirects
* A single source of truth for user authentication data (often called an identity provider)
* A defined protocol for an application to redirect an unauthenticated user to the identity provider
* A defined protocol for the identity provider to redirect requests back to the application 
* Sessions for each application (typically managed with cookies)

However, there are many use cases to consider, including:

* Account takeover
* Logout
* Account locking and revocation
* Loss of network access

Luckily, other folks have thought about these too, including standards bodies. Let's look at another implementation using a standard.

## SAML SSO

SAML is an alternative to OIDC which also allows single sign-on. It is older, and more complex, but well-supported across many applications, especially B2B applications.

(Again, if you're a stickler, this is talking about SAMLv2, the latest version of SAML, codified in 2005.)

SAML, in contrast to the JWT-based flow of OIDC, uses signed and/or encrypted XML documents to convey information about users. 

Let's look at a different scenario. 

Say you have two different applications: Zendesk and Gusto. You want to use SAML to integrate these applications with your identity provider.

Here's a diagram for an SAML flow. This is a service provider (SP) initiated flow, where a user attempts to access an application, such as Zendesk (the SP), when they are not logged in.

<SAMLSSOLogin alt={"SAML single sign-on request flow during login."} />

SAML is more complicated because of the breadth of the specification and because of the flexibility of XML. If you are looking to implement it, using a battle-tested library is a good idea.

FusionAuth provides an [open-source library for Java](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-samlv2/) that is regularly tested and updated.

## Why Use SAML

Why would you pick SAML over the OIDC flow mentioned above? 

Widespread support. SAML has been around since 2005 and many commercial off-the-shelf and open-source applications support it.

When evaluating your identity provider solution, think about what kinds of applications you need to support.

Any business-focused applications will typically support SAML, whereas support for OIDC is far easier to implement in your custom applications. Newer COTS applications may support OIDC.

For maximum flexibility, choose an identity provider that supports both standards.

## Beyond The Browser

Both SAML and OIDC are browser-based. They require functionality such as HTTP redirects, cookies, and the ability to interact using URLs.

There are other single sign-on protocols useful for other kinds of applications, such as desktop applications. Kerberos is a common one for client-server applications.

## Conclusion

Single sign-on is a key part of your application's authentication story. Your users care about it, even if they aren't familiar with the term.

SSO doesn't have to be difficult. Leveraging standards like OIDC and SAML helps you integrate both custom and commercial off-the-shelf applications with an identity provider.
