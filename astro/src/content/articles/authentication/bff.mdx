## What Is Backend For Frontend?

The backend for frontend (BFF) design pattern was popularized by [SoundCloud in 2015](https://philcalcado.com/2015/09/18/the_back_end_for_front_end_pattern_bff.html).

Most companies build a service with some web, Android, iOS, and desktop applications that naturally defaults to having a single API that serves all the apps. The SoundCloud diagram below shows this.

This design has a few problems:
- Each frontend (mobile, web, etc.) has to convert the data format from the one given by the API, to a format the app can use to display content. The frontend also has to make multiple API calls, and combine them, to get all the data it needs. This is extra work for the user's device and extra bandwidth.
- There is more collaboration and testing needed between all backend and frontend teams when anyone wants to change an API endpoint, or add a new feature.
- Since the API is public and may have free and paid features, authorization is tricky.

The BFF pattern, shown below, solves these problems by splitting the single API server into one API per app.

Each backend can now be considered part of the app. Features can be implemented freely by working on both a backend and frontend simultaneously, with affecting any other app.

## BFF And Authentication

How does authentication differ with BFF?

- All auth flows and interactions with the authorization server are handled securely in the backend
- Frontend uses backend endpoints to interact with auth-related capabilities


## BFF Authentication Is More Secure Than TODO
- No sensitive flows taking place in the frontend
- No secure artifacts stored in the frontend
- Reduced attack surface
- more todo

## BFF authentication design use case

Back in 2022, [FA didn't support BFF directly](https://fusionauth.io/blog/how-to-authenticate-your-react-app). which other gateways still don't?

hosted backend meant only browsers, not mobile - https://fusionauth.io/docs/apis/hosted-backend
