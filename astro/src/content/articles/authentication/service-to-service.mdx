## Introduction

This article explains how to use OAuth 2.0 and FusionAuth for service to service communication (which you can call machine OA). In other words, how to both provide and call an API programmatically, with no user logging in on a webpage.

## Understand user login

Let's start by summarizing how OAuth normally works for user login. You've most likely used FA for local login or third-party login. With local login, FA stores usernames and password hashes. With third-party login, another organization, like Google, handles authentication and FA is merely an intermediary. Either way, the authentication flow works as follows:

- A user (resource owner) clicks "Log in" on your website (client).
- Your site redirects the user to the URL of the authorization server, which could either be FA directly, or another redirection to Google. This URL includes parameters for the Id of your site (client Id), the URL the user's browser should be sent to after logging in (redirect URI), the response type of code, and the permissions your site is requesting on behalf of the user (scopes).
- The user logs in and consents to the permissions requested on a page provided by the server.
- The authorization server redirects the browser back to your site (using the redirect URI), with a temporary authorization code.
- Your site then starts a separate HTTP call to the server directly. This is more secure than using the browser. Now your site can ask the server for a key (access token) to access the user's resources in future calls. In this call your site sends the temporary authorization code, your client Id, and your client secret. The server might instead return a refresh token with a long duration, which can be used to request access tokens with short durations. This enhances security and limits the damage caused if an attacker manages to steal an access token.

The protocol above is called a flow, specifically the authorization code flow. What the flow returns is called a grant — access to the requested scopes. The grant is represented by data like the client credentials and the access token. The word grant is often used interchangeably with the word flow, but that isn't strictly correct.

For a detailed overview of all OAuth flows, please read the [FusionAuth modern guide to OAuth](https://fusionauth.io/resources/the-modern-guide-to-oauth.pdf).

## Why Not Use Only A Username And Password For Machine Authorization?

Let's move on from discussing users to discussing services. When you've called an API, you've most likely used a username and password — which might be called an access token or an API key. This is simple and secure, so why complicate it by using OAuth when you don't need to worry about users anyway?

Credential Management & Rotation

- With basic auth, changing passwords requires updating all services using them
- OAuth allows you to rotate client secrets without service downtime
- You can revoke specific tokens without changing the main credentials

Fine-grained Access Control

- OAuth scopes let you limit what each service can do
Example: Service A might only need "read" access to users, while Service B - needs "write" access
- Basic auth is usually all-or-nothing access

Audit Trail & Monitoring

- OAuth tokens can be tracked individually
You can see which service accessed what and when
- With basic auth, multiple services sharing the same credentials are - indistinguishable

Standardized Security

- OAuth is a well-tested protocol with industry best practices
Many security tools and platforms are built to work with OAuth
- Basic auth lacks features like token expiration and scope control

Scalability

- As your system grows, OAuth makes it easier to manage hundreds of service-to-service connections
- Each service can have its own client credentials with specific permissions
- Basic auth becomes a maintenance nightmare at scale




- Client Credentials Grant flow, where the client application directly requests an access token using its client ID and secret. There is no user involved.
- Access tokens often have much shorter expiration times compared to user-granted OAuth tokens, since there is no user to re-authenticate.
- The client authentication can use a pre-established client ID and secret (symmetric key), or leverage public/private key pairs (asymmetric keys) for higher security.
