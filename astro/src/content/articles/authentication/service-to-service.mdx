## Introduction

This article explains how to use OAuth 2.0 and FusionAuth for service to service communication (which you can call machine OA). In other words, how to both provide and call an API programmatically, with no user logging in on a webpage.

## Understand user login

Let's start by summarizing how OAuth normally works for user login. You've most likely used FA for local login or third-party login. With local login, FA stores usernames and password hashes. With third-party login, another organization, like Google, handles authentication and FA is merely an intermediary. Either way, the authentication flow works as follows:

- A user (resource owner) clicks "Log in" on your website (client).
- Your site redirects the user to the URL (authorization endpoint) of the authorization server, which could either be FA directly, or another redirection to Google. This URL includes parameters for the Id of your site (client Id), the URL the user's browser should be sent to after logging in (redirect URI), the response type of code, and the permissions your site is requesting on behalf of the user (scopes).
- The user logs in and consents to the permissions requested on a page provided by the server.
- The authorization server redirects the browser back to your site (using the redirect URI), with a temporary authorization code.
- Your site then starts a separate HTTP call to the server directly (to the token endpoint). This is more secure than using the browser. Now your site can ask the server for a key (access token) to access the user's resources in future calls. In this call your site sends the temporary authorization code, your client Id, and your client secret. The server might instead return a refresh token with a long duration, which can be used to request access tokens with short durations. This enhances security and limits the damage caused if an attacker manages to steal an access token.

The protocol above is called a flow, specifically the authorization code flow. What the flow returns is called a grant — access to the requested scopes. The grant is represented by data like the client credentials and the access token. The word grant is often used interchangeably with the word flow, but that isn't strictly correct.

For a detailed overview of all OAuth flows, please read the [FusionAuth modern guide to OAuth](https://fusionauth.io/resources/the-modern-guide-to-oauth.pdf).

## Understand machine login

Let's move on from discussing users to discussing services. The OA flow for calling an API from a machine with no user login page is called the client credentials flow.

- Your app makes a POST request to the token endpoint of the authorization server, passing your `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `grant_type` with value `client_credentials` as form data.
- Since the app is requesting access to its own resources, not the resources of a user, no consent is required.
- The server will return JSON containing an access token and possibly a list of scopes.

This flow is much simpler than the user flow earlier, but there are still some design choices to be aware of. Both the client and the resource server have to trust the authorization server. So both parties must be registered users of the authorization server. Additionally, the resource server needs to trust that when any call is made to it with an access token, that that access token represents the permissions granted by a client. So the authorization server must sign the access token (encrypt a hash of the token with its private key). Without a signature, any client could create an access token claiming whatever permissions they wanted.

## Designing A FusionAuth Example

Imagine you sell a file backup service that allows customers to save files in your storage. Your free service allows a customer to store up to 1 GB and your premium service allows more than that. You have two customers currently: North University and North Hospital. You want to start using OAuth authentication through FusionAuth. Customers will authenticate with your API using the client credentials flow. This flow is provided in FusionAuth by Entities, not Users. Please read the [documentation on Entities and Entity Types](https://fusionauth.io/docs/get-started/core-concepts/entity-management) before proceeding.

Let's look at the implications of this scenario:

- Your customers don't have to register on FusionAuth, or have any knowledge of it. To them, it is merely a generic OAuth endpoint they call to get an access token. It is only your service that needs to be aware of FusionAuth, and have the Ids of customers and permissions between FusionAuth and the service database agree.
- When receiving an API call, your service needs to check that the access token is signed by FusionAuth, that the caller is trying to access its own resorces, and the caller has permissions to perform the requested operation on those resources.
- A customer will change between free and premium. When working with individual users in FusionAuth, you could use roles, but entities do not support roles. How can you model this?

You can't use entity types for free and premium — one type for customers and one for premium customers — because you cannot change the type of an entity once it is created. Nor can entity types have default permissions to other entity types. Permissions are defined only between two entities.

Instead, you have two options:
- Write a script that calls the [FusionAuth Entity API](https://fusionauth.io/docs/apis/entities/entities#update-an-entity) and updates all permissions for an entity. Note that you will have to track which permissions premium customers should have and which permissions free customers should have, and which customers are of which type, outside FusionAuth. FusionAuth will have no concept of different customer types.
- Use the entity API to add a custom attribute of `premium` to premium customers. Then write a [Lambda](https://fusionauth.io/docs/extend/code/lambdas/client-credentials-jwt-populate) in FusionAuth to check if the customer has the `premium` attribute at login, and if so, add extra permissions to the access token returned to the customer This option is more complex than the previous, but allows you to keep all customer type and permission information in one place, in FusionAuth.

Below is a diagram of the system you'll build in this guide, using two entity types: API and Customer.

```mermaid
graph LR
  n1("NorthHospital (Customer)") --> |Send token, store files| n2("FileApi (API)")
  n3("NorthUniversity (Customer)") --> |Send token, store files| n2
  n4(FusionAuth)
  n1 --> |Get token| n4
  n2 --> |Verify token token|n4
  n3 --> |Get token|n4
```

<Aside type="note">
Entities can be used only with other entities, [not with users](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1295). So you can't model hospitals as entities, and have patients, admission staff, and doctors as users with different permissions to medical records at different hospitals. For that situation, you need to have a hospital as an application, with doctors and patients as roles for users. You would also need to add the hospital as an entity if you wanted external services to call it as an API. But the hospital as an entity and the hospital as an application are completely separate, and changes to each would need to be duplicated.
</Aside>

## Why Not Use Only A Username And Password For Machine Authorization?

Before looking at how to code this example, you might be wondering: why bother with the complexity of OAuth and access tokens, instead of giving customers a username and password? Firstly, calling an endpoint to get an access token, and sending that with API calls instead of the password directly, is only one extra step. So it's not much more work for customers. There are also several advantages:
- You can manage entities and permissions in one place — the FusionAuth web interface.
- Customers can store the client secret (password) very securely, and give only the access token to services that make API calls. In the event this token is exposed to attackers, it can be immediately revoked through an OAuth endpoint, without needing to change the client secret. Since access tokens expire, you also have password rotation by default.
- Basic authentication with a password usually gives an API caller full rights to do anything. With OAuth, you can issue a token with only certain permissions. In FusionAuth, you will need to create multiple entities to do this. For instance, you might create North Hospital Imaging and North Hospital Admissions as different entities with slightly different FileAPI permissions.
- Access tokens can be logged individually. You can see which service accessed what resource and when. With basic authentication, different services sharing the same customer username and password are indistinguishable.
