## Introduction

This article explains how to use OAuth 2.0 and FusionAuth for service to service communication (which you can call machine OA). In other words, how to both provide and call an API programmatically, with no user logging in on a webpage.

<PremiumEditionBlurbApi />

## Understand OAuth User Login

Let's start by summarizing how OAuth normally works for user login. You've most likely used FA for local login or third-party login. With local login, FA stores usernames and password hashes. With third-party login, another organization, like Google, handles authentication and FA is merely an intermediary. Either way, the authentication flow works as follows:

- A user (resource owner) clicks "Log in" on your website (client).
- Your site redirects the user to the URL (authorization endpoint) of the authorization server, which could either be FA directly, or another redirection to Google. This URL includes parameters for the Id of your site (client Id), the URL the user's browser should be sent to after logging in (redirect URI), the response type of code, and the permissions (scopes) your site is requesting on behalf of the user.
- The user logs in and consents to the permissions requested on a page provided by the server.
- The authorization server redirects the browser back to your site (using the redirect URI), with a temporary authorization code.
- Your site then starts a separate HTTP call to the server directly (to the token endpoint). This is more secure than using the browser. Now your site can ask the server for a key (access token) to access the user's resources in future calls. In this call your site sends the temporary authorization code, your client Id, and your client secret. The server might instead return a refresh token with a long duration, which can be used to request access tokens with short durations. This enhances security and limits the damage caused if an attacker manages to steal an access token.

The protocol above is called a flow, specifically the authorization code flow. What the flow returns is called a grant — access to the requested scopes. The grant is represented by data like the client credentials and the access token. The word grant is often used interchangeably with the word flow, but that isn't strictly correct.

For a detailed overview of all OAuth flows, please read the [FusionAuth modern guide to OAuth](https://fusionauth.io/resources/the-modern-guide-to-oauth.pdf).

## Understand OAuth Machine Login

Let's move on from discussing users to discussing services, or machine-to-machine OAuth. The flow for calling an API from a machine with no user login page is called the client credentials flow.

- Your app makes a POST request to the token endpoint of the authorization server, passing your `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `grant_type` with value `client_credentials` as form data.
- Since the app is requesting access to its own resources, not the resources of another user, no consent is required.
- The server will return JSON containing an access token and possibly a list of scopes.

This flow is much simpler than the user flow earlier, but there are still some design choices to be aware of. Both the client and the resource server have to trust the authorization server. So both parties must be registered users of the authorization server. Additionally, the resource server needs to trust that when any call is made to it with an access token, that that access token represents the permissions granted by a client. So the authorization server must sign the access token (encrypt a hash of the token with its private key). Without a signature, any client could create an access token claiming whatever permissions they wanted.

## Designing A FusionAuth Example

Imagine you sell a file backup service that allows customers to save files in your storage. Your free service allows a customer to store up to 1 GB and your premium service allows more than that. You have two customers currently: North University and North Hospital. You want to start using OAuth authentication through FusionAuth. Customers will authenticate with your API using the client credentials flow. This flow is provided in FusionAuth by Entities, not Users. Please read the [documentation on Entities and Entity Types](https://fusionauth.io/docs/get-started/core-concepts/entity-management) before proceeding.

Let's look at the implications of this scenario:

- Your customers don't have to register on FusionAuth, or have any knowledge of it. To them, it is merely a generic OAuth endpoint they call to get an access token. It is only your service that needs to be aware of FusionAuth, and have the Ids of customers and permissions between FusionAuth and the service database agree.
- When receiving an API call, your service needs to check that the access token is signed by FusionAuth, that the caller is trying to access its own resorces, and the caller has permissions to perform the requested operation on those resources.
- A customer will change between free and premium. When working with individual users in FusionAuth, you could use roles, but entities do not support roles. How can you model this?

You can't use entity types for free and premium — one type for customers and one for premium customers — because you cannot change the type of an entity once it is created. Nor can entity types have default permissions to other entity types. Permissions are defined only between two entities.

Instead, you have two options:
- Write a script that calls the [FusionAuth Entity API](https://fusionauth.io/docs/apis/entities/entities#update-an-entity) and updates all permissions for an entity. Note that you will have to track which permissions premium customers should have and which permissions free customers should have, and which customers are of which type, outside FusionAuth. FusionAuth will have no concept of different customer types.
- Use the entity API to add a custom attribute of `premium` to premium customers. Then write a [Lambda](https://fusionauth.io/docs/extend/code/lambdas/client-credentials-jwt-populate) in FusionAuth to check if the customer has the `premium` attribute at login, and if so, add extra permissions to the access token returned to the customer This option is more complex than the previous, but allows you to keep all customer type and permission information in one place, in FusionAuth.

Below is a diagram of the system you'll build in this guide, using two entity types: API and Customer.

```mermaid
graph LR
  n1("NorthHospital (Customer)") --> |Send token, store files| n2("FileApi (API)")
  n3("NorthUniversity (Customer)") --> |Send token, store files| n2
  n4(FusionAuth)
  n1 --> |Get token| n4
  n2 --> |Verify token token|n4
  n3 --> |Get token|n4
```

<Aside type="note">
Entities can be used only with other entities, [not with users](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1295). So you can't model hospitals as entities, and have patients, admission staff, and doctors as users with different permissions to medical records at different hospitals. For that situation, you need to have a hospital as an application, with doctors and patients as roles for users. You would also need to add the hospital as an entity if you wanted external services to call it as an API. But the hospital as an entity and the hospital as an application are completely separate, and changes to each would need to be duplicated.
</Aside>

## Why Not Use Only A Username And Password For Machine Authorization?

Before looking at how to code this example, you might be wondering: why bother with the complexity of OAuth and access tokens, instead of giving customers a username and password? Firstly, calling an endpoint to get an access token, and sending that with API calls instead of the password directly, is only one extra step. So it's not much more work for customers. There are also several advantages:
- You can manage entities and permissions in one place — the FusionAuth web interface.
- Customers can store the client secret (password) very securely, and give only the access token to services that make API calls. In the event this token is exposed to attackers, it can be immediately revoked through an OAuth endpoint, without needing to change the client secret. Since access tokens expire, you also have password rotation by default.
- Basic authentication with a password usually gives an API caller full rights to do anything. With OAuth, you can issue a token with only certain permissions. In FusionAuth, you will need to create multiple entities to do this. For instance, you might create North Hospital Imaging and North Hospital Admissions as different entities with slightly different FileAPI permissions.
- Access tokens can be logged individually. You can see which service accessed what resource and when. With basic authentication, different services sharing the same customer username and password are indistinguishable.

## Set Up A FusionAuth Machine-To-Machine OAuth Example

TODO fusionauth light docker compose

### Create Entity Types

- Browse to the FusionAuth web interface at http://localhost:9011.
- Authorize your paid FusionAuth features in Reactor.
- In the sidebar, open `Entity Management - Entity Types`.
- Click the `Add` button to create a new type.
- Enter `Customer` for `Name`. (You don't need to enter a specific UUID, because you won't be altering entity types in scripts.)
- In the JWT tab, enabled `Enabled` and set the `Access token signing key` to `RS256`.
- Click `Save` at the top right.
- You have just created a new Entity Type, Customer, that will be the type of all your customers using your API.
- Add a new type with the name `API`.
- You don't need to change the JWT signing algorithm here, because the API doesn't ever create access tokens - it only verifies tokens from clients.
- This time, before saving, add the following permissions in the permissions tab: `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, `StoreLargeData`.
- Save.

<Aside type="note">
All OAuth providers expose their public keys at the standard endpoint: http://localhost:9011/.well-known/jwks.json (on different domains though, of course). FusionAuth exposes apps' public keys at this endpoint, such as the `RS256` one you used above. This public key is used for any service to check that an access token it received was truly signed by FusionAuth. But FusionAuth doesn't expose the default signing key, an `HS256` one, so you actually can't use the default key for access tokens. This is why you changed the JWT key in the instructions above.
</Aside>

### Create Entities

- In the sidebar, open `Entity Management - Entites`.
- Click the `Add` button to create a new entity.
- Enter the following values:
  - `Id` - `09a00bb3-5099-4eff-af10-a1c139e847f9`
  - `Name` - `FileApi`
  - `Client Id` - `09a00bb3-5099-4eff-af10-a1c139e847f9`
  - `Client Secret` - `fDt7Pn5s3FymamBobVUxUtDwggxNpW1iyaujCOZjX6E`
  - `Entity Type` - `API`
- Save.

![FileApi](../../../../public/img/articles/authentication/service-to-service/fileapi.webp)

- Click the `Add` button to create a new entity.
- Enter the following values:
  - `Id` - `de085100-893e-463d-9641-a96c265b1f6c`
  - `Name` - `NorthHospital`
  - `Client Id` - `de085100-893e-463d-9641-a96c265b1f6c`
  - `Client Secret` - `_snp1-t_0ec5Tm9gj3RBoH-LNmZlqS4mVorcBPoF5go`
  - `Entity Type` - `Customer`
- Save.

- Click the `Add` button to create a new entity.
- Enter the following values:
  - `Id` - `40450891-0231-49c4-839b-b2c444f57f9c`
  - `Name` - `NorthUniversity`
  - `Client Id` - `40450891-0231-49c4-839b-b2c444f57f9c`
  - `Client Secret` - `EmQ3FL-rDqHuESnJCmZacFK3sKQbOKX-gQYnC5pPLio`
  - `Entity Type` - `Customer`
- Save.

Note that the client Ids and FusionAuth Ids are the same for each entity by default. This makes it easier to match entities between your API database and FusionAuth.

You are not saying anything about premium customers yet, except to have the `StoreLargeData` attribute in the API type.

### Add Permissions To Customers

- In the Entities screen, click `Manage` for `NorthUniversity`.
- In the `Entity grants` tab at the bottom, click `Add`.
- Type `api` in the search box and select `FileApi`.
- Enable all permissions except `StoreLargeData` and click `Save`.

The university now has permissions to add and update files through the API.

### Create Customer Code To Get Access Token

You are ready to get access tokens from FusionAuth as a Customer, and verify tokens as the API.

- Create a file called `customer.mjs`.
- Add the code below to get the access token for NorthUniversity.
  ```js
  import axios from "axios";

  async function getAccessToken() {
    try {
      const formData = new URLSearchParams();
      formData.append("grant_type", "client_credentials");
      formData.append("client_id", "40450891-0231-49c4-839b-b2c444f57f9c");
      formData.append("client_secret", "EmQ3FL-rDqHuESnJCmZacFK3sKQbOKX-gQYnC5pPLio");
      formData.append("scope", "read create update");

      const response = await axios({
        method: "post",
        url: "http://localhost:9011/oauth2/token",
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"},
        data: formData,
      });

      console.log("Access Token:", response.data.access_token);
      return response.data.access_token;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error getting access token:", error.response?.data || error.message);
      throw error;
    }
  }

  await getAccessToken();
  ```
- Run the command below in a terminal to make the JavaScript above get a token.
  ```sh
  docker run --rm -v ".:/app" -w "/app" node:23-alpine3.19 sh -c  \
  "npm install axios jsonwebtoken jwks-rsa"
  docker run --rm --network host -v ".:/app" -w "/app" node:23-alpine3.19 sh -c  \
  "node customer.mjs"

  # Output
  # Access Token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImd0eSI6WyJjbGllbnRfY3JlZGVudGlhbHMiXSwia2lkIjoiOGE3NWQ3YzkzIn0.eyJleHAiOjE3MzA0NjQ1MzIsImlhdCI6MTczMDQ2MDkzMiwiaXNzIjoiYWNtZS5jb20iLCJzdWIiOiI0MDQ1MDg5MS0wMjMxLTQ5YzQtODM5Yi1iMmM0NDRmNTdmOWMiLCJqdGkiOiI0ZWRkOGRjMy04YjAwLTQ2YTktOWZhNy1lNTY2YmE2ZGU4ZDUiLCJ0aWQiOiJkN2QwOTUxMy1hM2Y1LTQwMWMtOTY4NS0zNGFiNmM1NTI0NTMifQ.a46p7gVAHKOM4yPIPrvc_WzEd7AdToWPwR0Xguaoxyg
  ```
- Paste the token from your terminal into the textbox on the page at https://fusionauth.io/dev-tools/jwt-decoder.
  ![Decoded JWT](../../../../public/img/articles/authentication/service-to-service/jwt.webp)
- Below is what each of the fields means:
  ```js
  {
    "alg": "HS256",      // Algorithm used for signing the token (HMAC SHA-256)
    "typ": "JWT",        // Type of token (JSON Web Token)
    "gty": [             // Grant type used to obtain this token
      "client_credentials"
    ],
    "kid": "8a75d7c93"   // Key ID - identifies which key was used to sign this token
  }
  {
    "exp": 1730464532,   // Expiration time (Unix timestamp when token expires)
    "iat": 1730460932,   // Issued At (Unix timestamp when token was issued)
    "iss": "acme.com",   // Issuer (who created and signed this token)
    "sub": "40450891-0231-49c4-839b-b2c444f57f9c",  // Subject (whom the token refers to, in this case the client ID)
    "jti": "4edd8dc3-8b00-46a9-9fa7-e566ba6de8d5",  // JWT ID (unique identifier for this token)
    "tid": "d7d09513-a3f5-401c-9685-34ab6c552453"   // Tenant ID (if using multi-tenancy)
  }
  ```

### Authenticate The Access Token

The API needs to authenticate the access token is really from FusionAuth, rather than being sent by an attacker.



  ```js
  Token verification result: {
    active: true,
    exp: 1730466482,
    iat: 1730462882,
    iss: 'acme.com',
    jti: '7cc7151c-aa32-4d4b-b602-072a8584f052',
    sub: '40450891-0231-49c4-839b-b2c444f57f9c',
    tid: 'd7d09513-a3f5-401c-9685-34ab6c552453'
  }
  ```

- create server.js
  - use express to receive a single file storage call
  - create js to verify token in api - FIX error that won't allow you to use server client id to call the introspect endpoint
  -
  - unwrap token to see claims
- create curl script to update customer permissions
- create curl script to add or remove `premium` attribute
  - create lambda to change access token permissions based on the attribute
