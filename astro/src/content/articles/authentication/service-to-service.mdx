## Differences From User OAuth

- Client Credentials Grant flow, where the client application directly requests an access token using its client ID and secret. There is no user involved.
- Access tokens often have much shorter expiration times compared to user-granted OAuth tokens, since there is no user to re-authenticate.
- The client authentication can use a pre-established client ID and secret (symmetric key), or leverage public/private key pairs (asymmetric keys) for higher security.

## Why Not Use Only A Username And Password?

While username/password (basic auth) might seem simpler, using OAuth for service-to-service communication provides several crucial security benefits:

    Credential Management & Rotation

    With basic auth, changing passwords requires updating all services using them
    OAuth allows you to rotate client secrets without service downtime
    You can revoke specific tokens without changing the main credentials

    Fine-grained Access Control

    OAuth scopes let you limit what each service can do
    Example: Service A might only need "read" access to users, while Service B needs "write" access
    Basic auth is usually all-or-nothing access

    Audit Trail & Monitoring

    OAuth tokens can be tracked individually
    You can see which service accessed what and when
    With basic auth, multiple services sharing the same credentials are indistinguishable

    Standardized Security

    OAuth is a well-tested protocol with industry best practices
    Many security tools and platforms are built to work with OAuth
    Basic auth lacks features like token expiration and scope control

    Scalability

    As your system grows, OAuth makes it easier to manage hundreds of service-to-service connections
    Each service can have its own client credentials with specific permissions
    Basic auth becomes a maintenance nightmare at scale
