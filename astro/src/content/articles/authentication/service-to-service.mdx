## Introduction

This article explains how to use OAuth 2.0 and FusionAuth for service-to-service authentication, also known as machine-to-machine OAuth. In other words, how to provide and call an API programmatically, with no user logging in on a webpage.

<PremiumPlanBlurb />

## Understand OAuth User Login

Let's start by summarizing how OAuth normally works for user login, which you're more familiar with than machine OAuth. You've most likely used FusionAuth or another service for local login or third-party login. With local login, FusionAuth stores usernames and password hashes itself. With third-party login, another organization, like Google, handles authentication and FusionAuth is merely an intermediary. Either way, the authentication flow works as follows:

- A user (resource owner) clicks <InlineUIElement>Log in</InlineUIElement> on your website (client).
- Your site redirects the user to the URL (authorization endpoint) of the authorization server, which could either be FusionAuth directly, or another redirection to Google. This URL includes parameters for the Id of your site (client Id), the URL the user's browser should be sent to after logging in (redirect URI), the response type of code, and the permissions (scopes) your site is requesting on behalf of the user.
- The user logs in and consents to the permissions requested on a page provided by the server.
- The authorization server redirects the browser back to your site (using the redirect URI), with a temporary authorization code.
- Your site then starts a separate HTTP call to the server directly (to the token endpoint). This is more secure than using the browser, where the access token might be stolen. Now your site can ask the server for a key (access token) to access the user's resources in future calls. In this call your site sends the temporary authorization code, your client Id, and your client secret. The server might instead return a refresh token with a long duration, which can be used to request access tokens with short durations. This enhances security and limits the damage caused if an attacker manages to steal an access token.

The protocol above is called a flow, specifically the authorization code flow. What the flow returns is called a grant — access to the requested scopes. The grant is represented by data like the client credentials and the access token. The word grant is often used interchangeably with the word flow, but that isn't strictly correct.

For a detailed overview of all OAuth flows, please read the [FusionAuth modern guide to OAuth](https://fusionauth.io/resources/the-modern-guide-to-oauth.pdf).

## Understand OAuth Machine Login

Let's move on from discussing users to discussing services. In OAuth, the flow for calling an API from a machine with no user login page is called the client credentials flow.

- Your app makes a POST request to the token endpoint of the authorization server, passing your `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `grant_type` with value `client_credentials` as form data.
- Since the app is requesting access to its own resources, not the resources of another user, no consent is required.
- The server will return JSON containing an access token and possibly a list of scopes.

This flow is much simpler than the user flow earlier, but there are still some design choices to be aware of. Both the client and the resource server have to trust the authorization server. So both parties must be registered users of the authorization server. Additionally, the resource server needs to trust that when any call is made to it with an access token, that that access token represents the permissions granted by a client. So the authorization server must sign the access token (encrypt a hash of the token with its private key). Without a signature, any client could create an access token claiming whatever permissions they wanted.

## Designing A FusionAuth Example

Imagine you sell a file backup service that allows customers to save files in your storage. Your free service allows a customer to store up to 1 GB and your premium service allows more than that. You have two customers currently: North University and North Hospital. You want to start using OAuth authentication through FusionAuth. Customers will authenticate with your API using the client credentials flow. This flow is provided in FusionAuth by Entities, not Users. Please read the [documentation on Entities and Entity Types](https://fusionauth.io/docs/get-started/core-concepts/entity-management) before proceeding.

Let's look at the implications of this scenario:

- Your customers don't have to register on FusionAuth themselves   or use the web interface. To them, FusionAuth is merely a generic OAuth endpoint they call to get an access token. However, both your server and all clients need to know their Ids in FusionAuth, the Ids of the API to which they want access, and which permissions they have.
- When receiving an API call, your service needs to check that the access token is signed by FusionAuth, that the caller is trying to access its own resources, and the caller has permissions to perform the requested operation on those resources.
- A customer will change between free and premium. When working with individual users in FusionAuth, you could use roles, but entities do not support roles. How can you model this?

You can't use entity types for free and premium — one type for customers and one for premium customers — because you cannot change the type of an entity once it is created. Nor can entity types have default permissions to other entity types. Permissions are defined only between two entities, not types.

Instead, you have two options:
1. Write a script that calls the [FusionAuth Entity API](https://fusionauth.io/docs/apis/entities/entities#update-an-entity) and updates all permissions for an entity. Note that you will have to track which permissions premium customers should have and which permissions free customers should have, and which customers are of which type, outside FusionAuth. FusionAuth will have no concept of different customer types.
1. Use the entity API to add a custom attribute of `premium` to premium customers. Then write a [Lambda](https://fusionauth.io/docs/extend/code/lambdas/client-credentials-jwt-populate) in FusionAuth to check if the customer has the `premium` attribute at login, and if so, add extra permissions to the access token returned to the customer. This option is more complex than the previous one, but allows you to keep all customer type and permission information in one place, in FusionAuth.

Below is a diagram of the system you'll build in this guide, using two entity types: API and Customer.

```mermaid
graph LR
  n1("NorthHospital (Customer)") --> |Send token, store files| n2("FileApi (API)")
  n3("NorthUniversity (Customer)") --> |Send token, store files| n2
  n4(FusionAuth)
  n1 --> |Get token| n4
  n2 --> |Verify token|n4
  n3 --> |Get token|n4
```

<Aside type="note">
Entities can be used only with other entities, [not with users](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1295). So you can't model hospitals as entities, and have patients, admission staff, and doctors as users with different permissions to medical records at different hospitals. For that situation, you need to have a hospital as an application, with doctors and patients as roles for users. You would also need to add the hospital as an entity if you wanted external services to call it as an API. But the hospital as an entity and the hospital as an application are completely separate in FusionAuth, and changes to each would need to be duplicated.
</Aside>

## Why Not Use Only A Username And Password For Machine Authorization?

Before looking at how to code this example, you might be wondering: why bother with the complexity of OAuth and access tokens, instead of giving customers a username and password? Firstly, calling an endpoint to get an access token, and sending that with API calls instead of the password directly, is only one extra step. So it's not much more work for customers. There are also several advantages:
- You can manage entities and permissions in one place — the FusionAuth web interface.
- Customers can store the client secret (password) very securely, and give only the access token to services that make API calls. In the event this token is exposed to attackers, it can be immediately revoked through an OAuth endpoint, without needing to change the client secret. Since access tokens expire, you also have password rotation by default.
- Basic authentication with a password usually gives an API caller full rights to do anything. With OAuth, you can issue a token with only certain permissions.
- Access tokens can be logged individually. You can see which service accessed what resource and when. With basic authentication, different services sharing the same customer username and password are indistinguishable.

<Aside type="note">
You'll read the terms "verify" and "validate" a lot. "Verify" means that something is true, in other words, authentic or genuine. The person is who she says she is.

"Validate" means to check if something is correct, in other words, has the correct syntax and structure, and has the correct permissions to do what is being asked.
</Aside>

## Write A FusionAuth Machine-To-Machine OAuth Example

In this section, you'll learn how to set up FusionAuth to create the API and customer example. This guide needs only Docker. To follow along, download and unzip the repository (or use `git clone`) at https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-docker-compose.

Open a terminal in the `light` subdirectory. All commands will be run here.

### Create Entity Types

- First, start FusionAuth by running `docker compose up`, and wait a minute for all services to initialize.
- In a web browser, browse to the FusionAuth web interface at http://localhost:9011.
- In the sidebar, browse to <Breadcrumb>Reactor</Breadcrumb>, and authorize your paid FusionAuth features by entering your key.
- In the sidebar, open <Breadcrumb>Entity Management -> Entity Types</Breadcrumb>.
- Click the <InlineUIElement>Add</InlineUIElement> button to create a new type.
- Enter `Customer` for <InlineField>Name</InlineField>. (You don't need to enter a specific UUID, because you won't be altering entity types in scripts.)
- In the <InlineUIElement>JWT</InlineUIElement> tab, enabled <InlineUIElement>Enabled</InlineUIElement> and set the <InlineUIElement>Access token signing key</InlineUIElement> to `RS256`.
- Click <InlineUIElement>Save</InlineUIElement> at the top right.
- You have just created a new Entity Type, `Customer`, that will be the type of all customers using your API, both premium and free.
- Repeating the steps above, add a new entity type with the name `API`.
  - You don't need to change the JWT signing algorithm here, because the API doesn't ever create access tokens — it only verifies tokens from clients.
  - This time, before saving, add the following permissions in the <InlineUIElement>Permissions</InlineUIElement> tab: `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, `StoreLargeData`.
  - Save.

![Entity types in FusionAuth](../../../../public/img/articles/authentication/service-to-service/types.webp)

<Aside type="note">
All OAuth providers expose their public keys at the standard endpoint: http://localhost:9011/.well-known/jwks.json (on different domains though, of course). FusionAuth exposes apps' public keys at this endpoint, such as the `RS256` one you used above, which is an asymmetric key. This public key is used for any service to check that an access token it received was truly signed by FusionAuth.

The default signing key FusionAuth provides is symmetrical. This means that the same key both encrypts and decrypts the signature of the JWT. A FusionAuth administrator has to give the key, in a secret exchange, to any system that wants to verify signatures. The key cannot be publicly available in the `jwks.json` file, else anyone on the Internet can pretend to be FusionAuth and make fake JWTs. This is why you changed the key from the default symmetric one, `HS256`, to an asymmetric one.

Why offer symmetric keys at all if they're more work than asymmetric ones? Because the algorithm is much faster. If you have only one master system with lots of clients, then using a symmetric key will give you a performance improvement over using asymmetric keys. For example, the system you're building in this guide would be fine for a symmetric key. But if you have many services that all want to verify JWTs, then it's impractical to create and share symmetric keys with all of them.
</Aside>

### Create Entities

- In the sidebar, open <Breadcrumb>Entity Management -> Entites</Breadcrumb>.
- Click the <InlineUIElement>Add</InlineUIElement> button to create a new entity.
- Enter the following values:
  - <InlineField>Id</InlineField> — `09a00bb3-5099-4eff-af10-a1c139e847f9`
  - <InlineField>Name</InlineField> — `FileApi`
  - <InlineField>Client Id</InlineField> — `09a00bb3-5099-4eff-af10-a1c139e847f9`
  - <InlineField>Client Secret</InlineField> — `fDt7Pn5s3FymamBobVUxUtDwggxNpW1iyaujCOZjX6E`
  - <InlineField>Entity Type</InlineField> — `API`
- Save.

This API entity represents the single server that all customers will upload files to.

![FileApi](../../../../public/img/articles/authentication/service-to-service/fileapi.webp)

- Click the <InlineUIElement>Add</InlineUIElement> button to create a new entity.
- Enter the following values:
  - <InlineField>Id</InlineField> — `de085100-893e-463d-9641-a96c265b1f6c`
  - <InlineField>Name</InlineField> — `NorthHospital`
  - <InlineField>Client Id</InlineField> — `de085100-893e-463d-9641-a96c265b1f6c`
  - <InlineField>Client Secret</InlineField> — `_snp1-t_0ec5Tm9gj3RBoH-LNmZlqS4mVorcBPoF5go`
  - <InlineField>Entity Type</InlineField> — `Customer`
- Save.

- Click the <InlineUIElement>Add</InlineUIElement> button to create a new entity.
- Enter the following values:
  - <InlineField>Id</InlineField> - `40450891-0231-49c4-839b-b2c444f57f9c`
  - <InlineField>Name</InlineField> - `NorthUniversity`
  - <InlineField>Client Id</InlineField> - `40450891-0231-49c4-839b-b2c444f57f9c`
  - <InlineField>Client Secret</InlineField> - `EmQ3FL-rDqHuESnJCmZacFK3sKQbOKX-gQYnC5pPLio`
  - <InlineField>Entity Type</InlineField> - `Customer`
- Save.

<Aside type="note">
Note that the client Ids and FusionAuth Ids are the same for each entity by default. This makes it easier to match entities between your API database and FusionAuth.
</Aside>

You are not saying anything about premium customers yet, except to have the `StoreLargeData` attribute in the API type for future use.

### Add Permissions To Customers

- In the <InlineUIElement>Entities</InlineUIElement> screen, click <InlineUIElement>Manage</InlineUIElement> for `NorthUniversity`.
- In the <InlineUIElement>Entity grants</InlineUIElement> tab at the bottom, click <InlineUIElement>Add</InlineUIElement>.
- Type `api` in the search box and select <InlineUIElement>FileApi</InlineUIElement>.
- Enable all permissions except `StoreLargeData` and click <InlineUIElement>Save</InlineUIElement>.

The university now has permissions to add and update files through the API. The hospital has no permissions. Both customers are free customers, not premium, and don't have the `StoreLargeData` permission.

### Create Customer Code To Get Access Token

You are ready to get access tokens from FusionAuth as a customer, and verify tokens as the service provider (also called server or API).

Create a file called `customer.mjs` and add the code below to get the access token for NorthUniversity.
  ```js
  //import { storeFile } from "./api.mjs";
  import axios from "axios";

  async function getAccessToken() {
    try {
      const formData = new URLSearchParams();
      formData.append("grant_type", "client_credentials");
      formData.append("client_id", "40450891-0231-49c4-839b-b2c444f57f9c");
      formData.append("client_secret","EmQ3FL-rDqHuESnJCmZacFK3sKQbOKX-gQYnC5pPLio");
      formData.append("scope", "target-entity:09a00bb3-5099-4eff-af10-a1c139e847f9:Read   target-entity:09a00bb3-5099-4eff-af10-a1c139e847f9:Create   target-entity:09a00bb3-5099-4eff-af10-a1c139e847f9:Update");

      const response = await axios({
        method: "post",
        url: "http://localhost:9011/oauth2/token",
        headers: {"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"},
        data: formData,
      });

      console.log("Access Token:", response.data.access_token);
      return response.data.access_token;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(
        "Error getting access token:",
        error.response?.data || error.message,
      );
      throw error;
    }
  }

  const token = await getAccessToken();
  //storeFile("xray.jpg", token);
  ```

This code uses the Axios library to make HTTP calls simpler. It has one function, `getAccessToken()`, that calls the FusionAuth `/oauth2/token` endpoint to get an access token. Note the form parameters given in this function. Here you are saving the secret key directly in the code, which is not safe in reality. In a real application, you should save keys in a `.env` file that you don't commit to Git.

Finally, note the `scope` parameter. If you excluded this line, you would have an access token that provided authentication only, with no permissions (authorization) to do anything. FusionAuth requires all scopes to be requested in the format shown — with `target-entity` and the Id of the API you want access to.

Normally, you make an HTTP to a call to the API with the access token, but in this simplistic example, you simply import the API as another file, and call the `storeFile` method directly. This means you don't have to bother writing an HTTP request handler for this test. (Since the API doesn't exist yet, the first and last lines of the code are commented out for now).

- Run the command below in a new terminal to make the JavaScript above get a token and display it. Here you run Node.js in a Docker container to isolate it from the rest of your machine for safety's sake.
  ```sh
  docker run --rm -v ".:/app" -w "/app" node:23-alpine3.19 sh -c  \
  "npm install axios jsonwebtoken jwks-rsa"

  docker run --rm --network host -v ".:/app" -w "/app" node:23-alpine3.19 sh -c  \
  "node customer.mjs"

  # Output
  # Access Token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImd0eSI6WyJjbGllbnRfY3JlZGVudGlhbHMiXSwia2lkIjoiOGE3NWQ3YzkzIn0.eyJleHAiOjE3MzA0NjQ1MzIsImlhdCI6MTczMDQ2MDkzMiwiaXNzIjoiYWNtZS5jb20iLCJzdWIiOiI0MDQ1MDg5MS0wMjMxLTQ5YzQtODM5Yi1iMmM0NDRmNTdmOWMiLCJqdGkiOiI0ZWRkOGRjMy04YjAwLTQ2YTktOWZhNy1lNTY2YmE2ZGU4ZDUiLCJ0aWQiOiJkN2QwOTUxMy1hM2Y1LTQwMWMtOTY4NS0zNGFiNmM1NTI0NTMifQ.a46p7gVAHKOM4yPIPrvc_WzEd7AdToWPwR0Xguaoxyg
  ```
- Paste the returned token from your terminal into the text box on the page at https://fusionauth.io/dev-tools/jwt-decoder. Since an access token is plaintext encoded as Base64 bytes, no key is needed to display the original contents.
  ![Decoded JWT](../../../../public/img/articles/authentication/service-to-service/jwt.webp)
- Below is what each of the fields means:
  ```js
  {
    "alg": "HS256",      // Algorithm used for signing the token (HMAC SHA-256)
    "typ": "JWT",        // Type of token (JSON Web Token)
    "gty": [             // Grant type used to obtain this token
      "client_credentials"
    ],
    "kid": "8a75d7c93"   // Key ID - identifies which key was used to sign this token
  }
  {
    "exp": 1730464532,   // Expiration time (Unix timestamp when token expires)
    "iat": 1730460932,   // Issued At (Unix timestamp when token was issued)
    "iss": "acme.com",   // Issuer (who created and signed this token)
    "sub": "40450891-0231-49c4-839b-b2c444f57f9c",  // Subject (whom the token refers to, in this case the client ID)
    "jti": "4edd8dc3-8b00-46a9-9fa7-e566ba6de8d5",  // JWT ID (unique identifier for this token)
    "tid": "d7d09513-a3f5-401c-9685-34ab6c552453"   // Tenant ID (if using multi-tenancy)
  }
  ```

### Create Server Code To Authenticate The Access Token

- Create a file called `api.mjs`. This will act as the server that receives the file upload request and the access token from the customer. The API needs to authenticate the access token is really from FusionAuth, rather than being sent by an attacker.
- Add the code below to `api.mjs`.
```js
import axios from "axios";
import jwksClient from "jwks-rsa";
import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";

export async function storeFile(filename, token) {
  const verifiedToken = await verifyToken(token);
  if (verifiedToken.active &&
      verifiedToken.scope.includes("target-entity:09a00bb3-5099-4eff-af10-a1c139e847f9:Create"))
    console.log("\n" + filename + " stored successfully for " + verifiedToken.sub);
  else
    console.log("\nError: invalid token");
}

async function verifyToken(token) {
  const header = jwt.decode(token, { complete: true }).header;
  const client = jwksClient({jwksUri: "http://localhost:9011/.well-known/jwks.json"});
  const key = await client.getSigningKey(header.kid);
  const decodedToken = await jwt.verify(token, key.getPublicKey());
  decodedToken.active = decodedToken.exp > Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
  console.log(decodedToken);
  return decodedToken;
}
```

The server has two functions. The first, exported, function that the client calls, takes a token and checks if it is valid. If so, the server prints that the file was saved successfully. A valid token has three properties:
- It is correctly signed by FusionAuth.
- It has not expired yet.
- It has the `Create` permission for the `FileAPI` Id.

You can see the code above checks all three criteria. (Note that the function does not need to check the customer's Id, because this is not a situation where one customer has access to another customer's files.)

The other function in the code, `verifyToken()`, uses two JWT helper libraries. The function gets the public key of FusionAuth from the localhost URL, and uses it to check that the access token was signed correctly. It also checks that the current time is less than the expiry date of the access token.

Let's run both the customer and server to see if they work.

- Uncomment the first and last lines of `customer.mjs`, so it will call the server.
- Run the customer code again to see if the file is uploaded to the server successfully.
  ```sh
  docker run --rm --network host -v ".:/app" -w "/app" node:23-alpine3.19 sh -c  \
  "node customer.mjs"
  ```

## A Better Way To Verify A Token — Introspection

Verifying a token by manually looking at JWT signatures, as the code above does, is not standard in OAuth. Instead, all OAuth servers should allow anyone to verify a token by passing the token to the standard `introspect` endpoint. Example code to do this is given below.

```js
async function verifyTokenThroughIntrospectionEndpoint(token) {
  const response = await axios({
    method: "post",
    url: "http://localhost:9011/oauth2/introspect",
    headers: {"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"},
    data: `token=${token}&client_id=40450891-0231-49c4-839b-b2c444f57f9c&client_secret=EmQ3FL-rDqHuESnJCmZacFK3sKQbOKX-gQYnC5pPLio`
  });
  console.log("\nToken verification result:", response.data);
  return response.data;
}
```

Unfortunately, FusionAuth does not implement this endpoint correctly. In the code above, you have to send the customer's secret key along with the token to be verified. But the server is the one that wants to verify the key, and the server doesn't have access to the customer's secrets. So the server can't verify any access tokens with this endpoint, as it should be able to. If you try passing the server's secret key to FusionAuth it doesn't work either.

## Update An Entity's Permissions Using curl

Now that you know all the steps of machine OAuth in FusionAuth, let's consider the complexities of changing permissions for the case of a premium customer. If you don't need to know this for your situation, you can end the tutorial here.

Let's run a script to remove the `Read` permission for the API from North University and give it the premium functionality of `StoreLargeData`. Removing the read permission will show you what FusionAuth does if an entity requests a permission it doesn't have. You're going to use the FusionAuth API in the terminal to make these updates.

The documentation for the grants (permissions) API is [here](https://fusionauth.io/docs/apis/entities/grants#grant-a-user-or-entity-permissions-to-an-entity). For any APIs you would expect that the URL refers to the object you are updating, such as `http://localhost:9011/api/entity/09a00bb3-5099-4eff-af10-a1c139e847f9` updating the FileAPI in the code below. But in this FusionAuth API, it's backwards — the Id in the URL is where the permissions point to, and the Id of the object that's actually being updated is inside the JSON, `"recipientEntityId": "40450891-0231-49c4-839b-b2c444f57f9c" ` (North University).

- Run the curl command below to change the permissions `NorthUniversity` has to `FileApi`. (The API key in the header of this request was automatically created by the Kickstart file for this FusionAuth demonstration instance.)
  ```sh
  curl -X PUT \
    -H "Authorization: 33052c8a-c283-4e96-9d2a-eb1215c69f8f-not-for-prod" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "grant": {
        "permissions": [
          "Create",
          "Update",
          "StoreLargeData"
        ],
        "recipientEntityId": "40450891-0231-49c4-839b-b2c444f57f9c"
      }
    }' \
    "http://localhost:9011/api/entity/09a00bb3-5099-4eff-af10-a1c139e847f9/grant"
  ```

The script above is a manual way to change a customer's permissions from free to premium.

Next you're going to run another script to add the `premium` attribute to the North University entity. This allows you to manually add permissions to the access token in a lambda, as discussed earlier. This API is documented [here](https://fusionauth.io/docs/apis/entities/entities#update-an-entity).

```sh
curl -X PATCH \
  -H "Authorization: 33052c8a-c283-4e96-9d2a-eb1215c69f8f-not-for-prod" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "entity": { "data": { "premium": true } }
  }' \
  "http://localhost:9011/api/entity/40450891-0231-49c4-839b-b2c444f57f9c"
```

If you view North University in the FusionAuth web interface entities screen, you'll see it now has updated data and permissions.

In reality, you'll want to use one of the scripts above, not both, as they accomplish the same thing in different ways.

## Check The Updated Permissions

Run the customer script from before and you will now see it immediately fail, as expected, because the university requests read permissions to the File API, but they were removed in FusionAuth.

```sh
docker run --rm --network host -v ".:/app" -w "/app" node:23-alpine3.19 sh -c  \
  "node customer.mjs"

# Output: error_description: 'Invalid target-entity scope. The permission names [Read] are invalid.',
```

In `customer.mjs`, replace the request for the read permission, `"target-entity:09a00bb3-5099-4eff-af10-a1c139e847f9:Read",` with the large data permission, `"target-entity:09a00bb3-5099-4eff-af10-a1c139e847f9:StoreLargeData",`, and rerun the code. It should run successfully again, and in the decoded token you can see the access token now has the `StoreLargeData` permission, as shown below.

```js
{
  aud: '09a00bb3-5099-4eff-af10-a1c139e847f9',
  ...
  scope: 'target-entity:09a00bb3-5099-4eff-af10-a1c139e847f9:Create      target-entity:09a00bb3-5099-4eff-af10-a1c139e847f9:Update     target-entity:09a00bb3-5099-4eff-af10-a1c139e847f9:StoreLargeData',
  ...
}
```

You now know how to use the first method of changing permissions — manually updating them with a script. In the next section, you'll see the other way: how to check if a customer has the `premium` attribute you just added, and set the relevant permissions directly in FusionAuth for each access request.

## Write A Lambda Function To Add The `StoreLargeData` Permission To Premium Customers

- In the FusionAuth web interface sidebar, browse to <Breadcrumb>Customizations -> Lambdas</Breadcrumb>.
- Click the <InlineUIElement>+</InlineUIElement> button at the top right.
- For <InlineUIElement>Name</InlineUIElement>, enter `PremiumPermissions`.
- For <InlineUIElement>Type</InlineUIElement>, choose `Client credentials JWT populate`.
- Enter the code below and save the new lambda.
  ```js
  function populate(jwt, recipientEntity, targetEntities, permissions) {
    if (recipientEntity.data && recipientEntity.data.premium) {
      if (typeof targetEntities === "object") {
        var targetId = Object.keys(targetEntities)+""; //convert to string
        jwt.scope += ' target-entity:' + targetId + ':StoreLargeData';
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- Browse to <Breadcrumb>Tenants</Breadcrumb> in the sidebar.
- Click the <InlineUIElement>Edit</InlineUIElement> button for the default tenant.
- Select the <InlineUIElement>OAuth</InlineUIElement> tab.
- For <InlineUIElement>Client credentials populate lambda</InlineUIElement>, select `PremiumPermissions` lambda you just created.
- Click <InlineUIElement>Save</InlineUIElement> at the top right.

Now FusionAuth will run your custom code whenever returning an access token to a client. If the entity has the attribute `premium`, which you added earlier, then the client will be given the `StoreLargeData` permission to the entity it is requesting permission for.

## Test The Lambda Code

Before testing that the lambda populates `StoreLargeData` for North University, you first need to remove the permission you added earlier using the script. Return to the entities screen in FusionAuth and remove the `StoreLargeData` permission there for North University.

In `customer.mjs`, you also need to remove `target-entity:09a00bb3-5099-4eff-af10-a1c139e847f9:StoreLargeData`, because that permission is no longer explicitly set for the entity. If you try to request it from FusionAuth, you will receive an error. Instead, the lambda function will now automatically append the large data permission to any premium customers.

Run the customer script in the terminal again. Note below the permission added the end of the `scope` line by the lambda.

```sh
docker run --rm --network host -v ".:/app" -w "/app" node:23-alpine3.19 sh -c  \
  "node customer.mjs"

<Aside type="tip">
If you encounter errors in lambdas, you can enable the debug switch, add `console.log(` statements, and see their output in System -> Event log.
</Aside>

You've now seen both ways of managing permissions for different types of customers in FusionAuth, and can choose whichever you think is more appropriate for your situation. Using one or the other does not lock you into that approach. You can always switch later if things become more complex.
