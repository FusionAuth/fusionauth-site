## Security considerations

This a safe and feature rich login workflow in FusionAuth. It has the benefit that passwords are only ever provided directly to FusionAuth. It also has the benefit of full SSO capabilities when the user is automatically logged into the forum application by FusionAuth. The downside of this workflow is that the sessions might be shorter lived than refresh tokens, forcing the user to login more regularly. If this is the preferred behavior, than this workflow might be the best fit.  

## APIs used

Here are the FusionAuth APIs used in this example:

* [/oauth2/authorize](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/endpoints#authorize)
* [/oauth2/token](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/endpoints#refresh-token-grant-request)
