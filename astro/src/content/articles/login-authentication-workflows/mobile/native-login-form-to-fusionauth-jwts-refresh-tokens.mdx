## Security considerations

This workflow is one of the more secure methods of authenticating users. It uses a JWT and refresh token that are securely store on the mobile device. It has the benefit that passwords are only provided directly to FusionAuth.

## APIs used

Here are the FusionAuth APIs used in this example:

* [/api/login](/docs/apis/login#authenticate-a-user)
* [/api/jwt/refresh](/docs/apis/jwt#refresh-a-jwt)
* [/oauth2/token](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/endpoints#refresh-token-grant-request)
