  <li>FusionAuth looks up the refresh token and returns a new JWT</li>

## Security considerations

This workflow is less secure than other workflows because it is storing the user's JWT in local storage. While local storage provides convenient storage for single-page applications, any JavaScript running on the page has access to it. If an attacker can inject JavaScript into the page, they can begin stealing user's tokens (JWTs and refresh tokens). The attacker might introduce JavaScript into an open source project through obfuscated code or through a backend exploit of some kind. Many platforms like Wordpress also allow plugins to add JavaScript includes to websites as well. Therefore, ensuring that your JavaScript is secure can be extremely difficult.

This workflow might still be a good solution for some applications. Developers should just weigh the risks associated with local storage of JWTs versus the other workflows we have documented.

## APIs used

Here are the FusionAuth APIs used in this example:

* [/api/login](/docs/apis/login#authenticate-a-user)
* [/api/jwt/refresh](/docs/apis/jwt#refresh-a-jwt)
* [/oauth2/token](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/endpoints#refresh-token-grant-request)
