## Security considerations

This workflow is less secure than other workflows because the JWT is available to JavaScript during the cookie drop process. While this is a small window of time, it is still possible that malicious JavaScript running in the application could gain access to the JWT. If an attacker can inject JavaScript into the page, they can begin stealing user's JWTs. The attacker might introduce JavaScript into an open source project through obfuscated code or through a backend exploit of some kind. Many platforms like Wordpress also allow plugins to add JavaScript includes to websites as well. Therefore, ensuring that your JavaScript is secure can be extremely difficult.

This workflow might still be a good solution for some applications. Developers should just weigh the risks associated with JWTs accessible to JavaScript versus the other workflows we have documented.

## APIs used

Here are the FusionAuth APIs used in this example:

* [/api/login](/docs/apis/login#authenticate-a-user)
* [/api/jwt/refresh](/docs/apis/jwt#refresh-a-jwt)
* [/oauth2/token](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/endpoints#refresh-token-grant-request)
