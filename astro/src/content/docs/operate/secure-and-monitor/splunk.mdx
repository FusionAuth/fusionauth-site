## Introduction

> [Splunk Observability Cloud is a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution for infrastructure monitoring (Splunk IM), application performance monitoring (Splunk APM), real user monitoring (Splunk RUM), and synthetic monitoring (Splunk Synthetic Monitoring). Splunk Observability Cloud also provides a direct integration with logs ingested in Splunk Cloud Platform and Splunk Enterprise through Log Observer Connect.](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/get-started/service-description.html)

Splunk has two sets of docmentation, the [primary](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/) and the [developer](https://dev.splunk.com/observability/docs).

## FusionAuth Metrics

https://fusionauth.io/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/monitor#metrics
- [Application events](https://fusionauth.io/docs/extend/events-and-webhooks/events/)
- [Metrics](https://fusionauth.io/docs/apis/system#retrieve-system-status)
- OpenTelemetry data

### Login Records

<strong>System -> Login Records</strong> lists all user logins to FusionAuth.

User | User Id | Application | Application Id | Time | Location | IP address
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
workaddress/fa@simplelogin.com | 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 | FusionAuth | 3c219e58-ed0e-4b18-ad48-f4f92793ae32 | 6/4/2024 11:17 AM SAST | â€“ | 172.20.0.1

### Logs

<strong>System -> Logs</strong> show nothing if you are running Docker. Instead, the logs are written to the terminal.

## Splunk Setup

- Sign up for Splunk at https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-cloud.html with an email address at a custom domain.
- Splunk will email you a link to another site with a username and password. Note that this is **not** the correct site. Splunk divides its products into completely separate dashboards.
- Register for the Observability Cloud trial at https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/o11y-cloud-free-trial.html.
- Verify your email address with the link in the email they send you. This should also log you in to the Observability dashboard.
- In the future, you can log in to the dashboard at https://login.signalfx.com.

Documentation for Splunk Observability is at https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/get-started/welcome.html.

Pricing is at https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/pricing/observability.html. Infrastructure monitoring, Log observer connect, and Synthetic uptime monitoring are included in the Splunk Infrastructure monthly fee. Each Splunk product has a separate 14 day trial.

- Click <InlineField>Connect Accounts</InlineField>

## Import Data To Splunk With The API

Using the Splunk API to import metrics is documented [here](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/gdi/other-ingestion-methods/rest-APIs-for-datapoints.html#rest-api-ingest).

[To authenticate API requests that send data to Splunk Observability Cloud, you must use an organization access token, not a user API access token.](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/admin/authentication/authentication-tokens/api-access-tokens.html)

- Log in to your Observability account at https://login.signalfx.com.
- Click the logo at the top left to expand the menu labels.
- Click <strong>Settings -> View Profile -> Organizations</strong>
  - Note your realm and endpoints, for instance `us1`, `https://api.us1.signalfx.com`, `https://ingest.us1.signalfx.com`
- Get an [access token](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/admin/authentication/authentication-tokens/org-tokens.html#admin-org-tokens) (also called organization token).
  - Click <strong>Settings -> Access Tokens</strong>
  - Expand the `Default` access token
  - Click <InlineField>Show Token</InlineField> and note the token

Test that you can import data with the terminal command below.
  - Replace `<ORG_TOKEN>` with your token and `<REALM>` with your realm.

```sh
curl --request POST \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --header "X-SF-TOKEN: <ORG_TOKEN>" \
  --data \
  '{
      "gauge": [
          {
              "metric": "memory.free",
              "dimensions": { "host": "server1" },
              "value": 42
          }
      ]
  }' \
  https://ingest.<REALM>.signalfx.com/v2/datapoint
```

The response should be `"OK"`.

- Return to the Observability dashboard home.
- Browse to <strong>Metric Finder</strong>.
- Enter `memory` in the text box and click <InlineField>Search metrics</InlineField>
- Click <InlineField>memory.free</InlineField>
- You should see the data point created by the command above on the chart. If you can't, try switching to the Column chart view, or run the command again with a different value.

## Import Data To Splunk With OpenTelemetry And Java

## Import Data To Splunk With The OpenTelemetry Linux Collector

```mermaid
graph LR
  subgraph G[Docker]
    H[(Postgresql)]
  end
  subgraph C[Docker]
    D(OpenTelemetry for Java) --> A(FusionAuth)
  end
  subgraph E[Docker]
    B(Splunk OpenTelemetry collector)
  end
  A --> H
  D --> B
  B --> F(OpenTelemetry web server)
```


This section is a demonstration of Splunk's [OpenTelementry Linux collector tutorial](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/gdi/opentelemetry/collector-linux/collector-configuration-tutorial/about-collector-config-tutorial.html#about-collector-configuration-tutorial).

To make the FusionAuth Docker image small, the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/blob/master/docker/fusionauth/fusionauth-app/Dockerfile) makes some changes to the Ubuntu installation that need to be reversed to use OpenTelemetry.

After starting the FusionAuth container with `docker compose up`, open a terminal and attach to the container as the `root` user (the default user is `fusionauth`). Replace `fa` with your container name.

```sh
docker exec -it -u root fa bash
```

Now enter the commands below to install OpenTelemetry for Splunk in the container.

```sh
mkdir -p /var/lib/apt/lists/partial
chmod 755 /var/lib/apt/lists/partial
apt update
apt install -y ca-certificates
apt install -y systemctl
apt install -y curl
apt install -y software-properties-common
apt install -y lsb-release
apt install -y systemd
apt install -y dialog

export SPLUNK_REALM="us1" # replace with your realm
export SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN="abSE5G5ZAJ8K34h5a-qXwg" # replace with your access token
export SPLUNK_MEMORY_TOTAL_MIB="512"

curl -sSL https://dl.signalfx.com/splunk-otel-collector.sh > /tmp/splunk-otel-collector.sh;
sh /tmp/splunk-otel-collector.sh --realm $SPLUNK_REALM --memory $SPLUNK_MEMORY_TOTAL_MIB -- $SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN
# The Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector for Linux has been successfully installed.
```
