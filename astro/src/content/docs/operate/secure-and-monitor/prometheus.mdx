## Prometheus Setup

<Aside type="version">
Available since `1.26.0`

Prometheus is a tool to monitor metrics and setup alerts in the case that some metric has responded negatively for an extended period.

### Setup
Setting this up with FusionAuth is easy. To monitor FusionAuth with Prometheus, point your Prometheus server to the FusionAuth Prometheus endpoints. Below is an example of Prometheus configuration for a FusionAuth instance running locally on the docker host. You can reach the host via the `host.docker.internal` hostname on MacOS and Windows.

<Aside type="caution">
These instructions are for monitoring FusionAuth with Prometheus when you are self-hosting.

FusionAuth Cloud deployments with more than one compute node round-robin requests to the Prometheus endpoint. Using this endpoint to monitor such a deployment is not recommended.

[Learn more about this issue here](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2379).

## Configuration

The Prometheus endpoint is configured with the YAML file. [Learn more about the Prometheus configuration](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/).

Prometheus does not provide functionality to authenticate using custom HTTP headers.

To authenticate, use basic auth. Use the value `apikey` as the username and an API key as the password. The API key must have `GET` permission for the `/api/prometheus/metrics` endpoint. Refer to the [Authentication](/docs/apis/authentication) document for more details about API keys.

If you prefer to allow unauthenticated access to this endpoint from local scrapers, you may set `fusionauth-app.local-metrics.enabled=true`. See the  [configuration reference](/docs/reference/configuration) for more info.

All other configuration in the YAML file is standard Prometheus `scrape_config` configuration.

```yaml title="Sample prometheus.yaml"
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: FusionAuth
    scrape_interval: 60s
    scheme: https
    metrics_path: api/prometheus/metrics
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['local.fusionauth.io']
    basic_auth:
      username: "apikey"
      password: "Jw4cGzKpzxcEsqnqFKw3m7jUvgeS-jtUvn8B0TDBxgQ="
```

Start Prometheus:

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd)/prometheus.yaml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml -p 9090:9090 prom/prometheus
```

Your Prometheus dashboard will look something like this.
