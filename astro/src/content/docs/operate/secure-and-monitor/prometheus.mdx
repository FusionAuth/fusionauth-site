## Prometheus Setup

Prometheus is a tool to monitor metrics and setup alerts in the case that some metric has responded negatively for an extended period.

### Setup
Setting this up with FusionAuth is easy. The only requirement to hookup FusionAuth is to direct Prometheus to the FusionAuth Prometheus endpoints. We used the following configuration for a FusionAuth instance running locally on the docker host. (You can reach docker host IP via `host.docker.internal` on mac and windows docker.)

## Configuration
The Prometheus endpoint is configured with the YAML file. You can learn more about the Prometheus configuration [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#). Prometheus does not provide functionality to authenticate using custom HTTP headers. As a workaround, we are using API key as password using "basic auth" authorization method.

In order to authenticate using basic auth please use string "apikey" as the username and a valid API key as the password. The API key must have `GET` permission for the `/api/prometheus/metrics` endpoint.

If you prefer to allow unauthenticated access to this endpoint from local scrapers, you may set `fusionauth-app.local-metrics.enabled=true`. See the  [configuration reference](/docs/reference/configuration) for more info.

All other configuration is standard Prometheus `scrape_config`.

Please refer to the [Authentication](/docs/apis/authentication#) document for more details about API keys.


```yaml title="prometheus.yaml"
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: FusionAuth
    scrape_interval: 5s
    scheme: https
    metrics_path: api/prometheus/metrics
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['local.fusionauth.io']
    basic_auth:
      username: "apikey"
      password: "Jw4cGzKpzxcEsqnqFKw3m7jUvgeS-jtUvn8B0TDBxgQ="
```


We then started Prometheus with
```bash
docker run -v $(pwd)/prometheus.yaml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml -p 9090:9090 prom/prometheus
```
