## Overview

After a grant, FusionAuth delivers access tokens to the client. The client may also receive refresh and Id tokens, depending on the scopes requested.

These tokens are signed and signify that an authentication has occurred. You must store these tokens appropriately.

## Access Token And Refresh Storage Options

Access tokens are meant to be presented by the client to secure resources to gain access to data or functionality. This includes APIs or other services. 

Refresh tokens are designed to be presented by the client to FusionAuth in order to get a new access token.  Your refresh tokens live longer, typically while your Access Tokens may be shorter lived for security reasons.

Access tokens and refresh tokens should be stored in a secure fashion. In general, FusionAuth recommends that these tokens be inaccessible to the client.

Here are storage options for access and refresh tokens.

## Id Token Storage Options

Id tokens contain data meant to be used by the client. For example, a JavaScript component can examine an Id token to display the name of a user.

Secure them in the same way you would any other user data that is readable by a browser or mobile app.
