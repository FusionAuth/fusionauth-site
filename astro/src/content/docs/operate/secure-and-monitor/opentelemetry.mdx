FusionAuth is a Java application. You can use the [OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation) project to instrument it. Doing so can assist troubleshooting performance issues and make it easier to run.

<Aside type="note">
As of FusionAuth version 1.37.0, FusionAuth has switched to a lighter weight HTTP server backend. The `java-http` server does not have out of the box instrumentation from the `opentelemetry-javaagent.jar`. In versions 1.37.0 or later, you can not get request traces from FusionAuth.

See [this open GitHub issue](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1665) for more discussion and to upvote or comment.
</Aside>

FusionAuth has no custom tracing spans embedded, but it can be set up as an OpenTelemetry exporter. Doing so provides useful data about types of requests, database queries, and more.

### Set Up the Exporter

Download the [Java OpenTelemetry agent](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation). Make it available to the FusionAuth instance. If you are using a zip/deb/rpm, put it in a directory. If using docker, mount the host directory to the container.
Set an environment variable `OT_PATH` to point to the directory.

Next, you need to configure FusionAuth to use the agent by passing the correct Java command line switches. There are a couple of ways to do this.

You can use Java system properties, environment variables, or edit the `fusionauth.properties` configuration file. See the [configuration reference](/docs/reference/configuration) for more info. For this example, environment variables will be used.

Set this environment variable and make sure it is available when you start FusionAuth (in a startup script, `.bashrc`, etc.):

```shell title="Enabling OpenTelemetry export"
export FUSIONAUTH_APP_ADDITIONAL_JAVA_ARGS="-javaagent:$OT_PATH/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar"
```

Next, configure OpenTelemetry to point to your collector.
Here's an example of the environment variables to set to use [HoneyComb](https://www.honeycomb.io/) as your collector. The specific variables needed will vary based on your chosen solution; please consult the collector's documentation.

```shell title="Configuring OpenTelemetry collector"
# from https://docs.honeycomb.io/getting-data-in/opentelemetry/java-distro/#using-opentelemetry-without-the-honeycomb-distribution
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://api.honeycomb.io
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=x-honeycomb-team=$HONEYCOMB_API_KEY
export OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=fusionauth-test
export OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER=traceidratio
export OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG=0.5
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=SampleRate=2
export OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_CAPTURE_HEADERS_CLIENT_REQUEST=X-FusionAuth-TenantId
```

Start FusionAuth and enjoy your new insights.
