## Overview

[Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/application/) is an observability service you can integrate with your FusionAuth applications to collect events and metrics and send them to Datadog to analyze your monitoring and performance data.

This guide, we show you how to connect FusionAuth to Datadog. It will cover:

- How to create and set up a Datadog account
- How to add a Datadog Agent inside Fusionauth docker image to collect and export telemetry data.
- How to create a dashboard to monitor FusionAuth metrics.
- How to add a Datadog Agent on a separate (windows) host and monitor the Prometheus endpoint exposed by FusionAuth.
- How to set up an OpenTelemetry Linux collector to receive, process, and export telemetry data.
- How to add export logs or events with a Python app with the use of the Datadog API.

## FusionAuth Metrics

Before reading this guide, please read the [FusionAuth guide to monitoring](https://fusionauth.io/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/monitor) to understand what metrics are available and choose the ones relevant to your needs.

### Set Up Prometheus API Access In FusionAuth

Fusionauth exposes metrics in a 'Prometheus Endpoint', but you must generate an API key and give permission to the "get" request to access it.
To do this

- Log in to your FusionAuth instance and navigate to settings. Click on the API keys link. On the top-right side of the page, click on the green + to add a new API key.

![Enable-APIKey-Prometheus-Endpoint-FusionAuth](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/datadog-fusionauth-enableapikey-prometheus-endpoint.png).

- Enter a description for the API to identify it. Scroll down and add the GET permission on the endpoint :/api/prometheus/metrics.
- Go back to the previous screen.
- Click on the Red lock, next to the API key that you generated, to copy the value of the key.

![APIKey-FusionAuth](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/datadog-fusionauth-apikey.png).

## Datadog Metrics

Please read the following documentation about metrics with Datadog to get a better understanding.

- General introduction on metrics with Datadog(https://docs.datadoghq.com/metrics/).
- OpenTelemetry is discussed [here](https://docs.datadoghq.com/opentelemetry/?_ga=2.63663855.1324212944.1718441678-2001470719.1718441677&_gac=1.150758018.1718441678.EAIaIQobChMI1OXNip7dhgMV_UNBAh1xfQDYEAAYASAAEgIBs_D_BwE).

### Set up The Datadog Agent

The Datadog Agent collects metrics and events from your systems and apps. It can be installed anywhere, even on your workstation. Click on the Ubuntu agent, and it will show the below code. This will be added to the Fusionauth Dockerfile to install and start the agent. Make sure your API key and region are correct.

```bash
DD_API_KEY=<yourapikey> DD_SITE="us5.datadoghq.com" bash -c "$(curl -L https://s3.amazonaws.com/dd-agent/scripts/install_script_agent7.sh)"
```

![Install-Datadog-Agent-Ubuntu](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/install-datadog-agent-ubuntu.png)

<Aside type="note">
  For more information on manual configuration or troubleshooting see the "Manual Step-by-Step Instructions on the agent setup page.
</Aside>

- Save the <InlineField>Dockerfile</InlineField> from the [FusionAuth official image](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/blob/master/docker/fusionauth/fusionauth-app/Dockerfile) to your computer. 
- Edit the file. Above the paragraph labelled ###### Start FusionAuth App, you will add a version of the code generated from the Datadog site to the DockerFile.

```bash
 ### NEW FOR DATADOG ###
    RUN mkdir -p /var/lib/apt/lists/partial \
    && chmod 755 /var/lib/apt/lists/partial \
    && apt update \
    && apt install -y ca-certificates curl  sudo \
    && cd /usr/local/fusionauth \
    && curl -L -o install_script_agent7.sh https://s3.amazonaws.com/dd-agent/scripts/install_script_agent7.sh \ 
    && chmod +x /usr/local/fusionauth/install_script_agent7.sh

    ### Install DATADOG Agent App ###
    ENV DD_API_KEY="<your API key from datadog website>"  
    ENV DD_SITE="us5.datadoghq.com" #<your site from Datadog website>
    ENV DD_INSTALL_ONLY=false
    ENV DD_HOSTNAME="fusionauthdocker"
    RUN /bin/bash -c "/usr/local/fusionauth/install_script_agent7.sh"

    ### Copy the OpenMetrics configuration file ###
    COPY openmetrics.d-conf.yaml /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/openmetrics.d/conf.yaml
    
    # Allow fusionauth user to run datadog-agent service without password
    RUN echo "fusionauth ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/service datadog-agent start" > /etc/sudoers.d/fusionauth

    # Ensure correct ownership and permissions for the log directory
    RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/fusionauth/logs \
        && chown -R fusionauth:fusionauth /usr/local/fusionauth/logs

    # # Modify FusionAuth start script to start Datadog Agent as root and continue on failure
    # RUN head -n -1 /usr/local/fusionauth/fusionauth-app/bin/start.sh > temp.sh \
    # && echo 'sudo service datadog-agent start <&- >>  /dev/null' >> temp.sh \
    # && mv temp.sh /usr/local/fusionauth/fusionauth-app/bin/start.sh \
    # && chown fusionauth:fusionauth /usr/local/fusionauth/fusionauth-app/bin/start.sh \
    # && chmod +x /usr/local/fusionauth/fusionauth-app/bin/start.sh

```

- Download the Datadog agent from https://s3.amazonaws.com/dd-agent/scripts/install_script_agent7.sh, and set some extra environment variables to complete the installation.
- After installing the Datadog agent, copy the config(openmetrics.d-conf.yaml), to handle the open metrics integration.

openmetrics.d-conf.yaml:

 ```yaml 
  init_config:
  instances:
  - prometheus_url: http://localhost:9011/api/prometheus/metrics
    namespace: Fusionauth_docker_metrics_openmetric_agent
    metrics:
      - '*'
    headers:
      Authorization: '<Your fusion Auth API key with access to Prometheus metrics>'
      Content-Type: 'application/json'
```

Build the Dockerfile into a new image to use in place of the official FusionAuth one.

```sh
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t faimage .
```

Use the <InlineField>docker-compose-yaml</InlineField> file from the FusionAuth [five-minute guide](/docs/quickstarts/5-minute-setup-guide).

To start the docker containers use docker-compose

``` bash
  docker-compose.exe  -f .\docker-compose.yml  up    -d

```
<Aside type="note">
  The code to autostart is commented out in the sammple because the current version of the agent gives a fail message when it starts, althoug it start sucessfully.
  This stops fusion auth from starting in the docker component.
  You must start the agent manually when Fusionauth is running with the script below
</Aside>

  ```bash
    docker ps    # to get the uid for the FAimage  i.e  0d

    docker  exec -u root -it 0d service datadog-agent start  #start the agent 

    docker  exec -u root -it 0d service datadog-agent status #get tehe service status shoud respomnd with  * datadog-agent is running
  ```

When the agent is successfully installed and started, you will get a screen that will refresh and indicate that reports from the agent are received. Click on finish to continue.

<Aside type="note">
  - If you navigate to infrastructure on the Datadog website on the left and click on hosts, it will show all the hosts/agents registered. If you click on the agent block, it will show you the metrics that were received.
</Aside>

### Create Your First Dashboard

![Datadog-Agent-Reporting](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/datadog-agent-reporting.png)

- On the <InlineField>Create Dashboard</InlineField>, click on the <InlineField>Create Dashboard</InlineField>.

![Datadog-Agent-Reporting](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/datadog-website-create-dashboard.png)

- Name the dashboard. If you have organizations configured, you may select the team or ignore it of not. You can select your preferred layout. Click on 'New Dashboard'.

![Datadog-Agent-Reporting](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/datadog-website-create-new-dashboard.png)

<Aside type="note">
Here are some of the available metrics, others can be found in the documents attached in the further reading section. When you integrations more metrics will be available.
- datadog.agent.python.version
- datadog.agent.running
- datadog.agent.started
- datadog.agent.retry_queue_duration.by_bytes_per_sec
- datadog.agent.retry_queue_duration.capacity_bytes
- datadog.agent.retry_queue_duration.capacity_secs
- ntp.offset
- cpu 
- procss memory usage
- load average
- memmory breakdown
- available swap
- diskusage by device
- disk latency 
- network trafic
</Aside>

Add data to the dashboard.

- For visualization, choose TimeSeries.
- Add the following to Metrics to monitor: system.net.bytes_rcvd, system.net.bytes_sen.  On the right side, change the colour to yellow in the one metric to see the difference.
- For the <InlineField>time preference</InlineField> choose last 15 minutes.
- Give a title to the graph. Click on save.

![Datadog-Website-New-Dashboard-Configuration](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/datadog-website-new-dashboard-configuration.png)

You created your first dashboard page!.
![Datadog-Website-New-Dashboard-Configuration](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/datadog-website-new-dashboard-preview.png)

## Add OpenMetrics Integration In Datadog.

Fusionauth exposes a Prometheus endpoint, which can be monitored by an "openMetric" Integration in Datadog.

- On the Main Datadog website, Click the Integrations tab in the bottom left. Search for open metrics, and click on the tile presented.

![Datadog-Website-Integrations-OpenMetrics](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/datadog-openmetrics-install-integration.png)

The installation consists of 2 parts.

- Click on the installation-button, in the top right.
- Configured the OpenMertics Section in the agent.

<Aside type="note">
   You must configure an API key to allow Prometheus metrics on the Fusionauth instance. [Set Up Prometheus API Access in FusionAuth](#set-up-prometheus-api-access-in-fusionauth)
</Aside>

Use the sample config file to configure the open metrics integrations. It was already copied to the docker container when we created it.

``` yaml
init_config:
instances:
  - prometheus_url: http://localhost:9011/api/prometheus/metrics  
    namespace: Fusionauth_docker_metrics_openmetric_agent #any name that you want reflected in datadog
    metrics:
      - '*'
    headers:
      Authorization: '<your Datadog API key>'
      Content-Type: 'application/json'
```

This file must be copied to the config folder after the installation of the Datadog agent to send metrics to Datadog. This must be added to the DockerFile before the section <InlineField> ### start the agent ###</InlineField>

``` bash
  # Copy the OpenMetrics configuration file
    COPY openmedtrics.d-conf.yaml /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/openmetrics.d/conf.yaml
```

When successfully configured, the Datadog container and the Datadog agent should start sending data to Datadog.

Below is a sample of the data sent.

![Datadog Openmetrics Dashboard](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/datadog-openmetrics-dashboard.png)

You can add a new dashboard time display these metrics, using the same steps as [Create Your First Dashboard](#create-your-first-dashboard).
Use your namespace from the config file i.e. <InlineField>Fusionauth_docker_metrics_openmetric_agent</InlineField> to search for metrics to add from this agent.

### Add The Datadog Agent On A Remote Host To Capture Prometheus/Open Metric Data

The Datadog agent can be installed on a separate machine to monitor Prometheus metrics from a remote fusionauth host. You can install the <InlineField>Windows datadog agent</InlineField> on a Windows host and monitor a remote FusionAuth Host.
Before Installing and configuring the Prometheus agent, install the Prometheus integrations using similar steps as used in [Add OpenMetrics Integration in Datadog](#add-openmetrics-integration-in-datadog),
but instead of searching for Openmetrics, search for [Prometheus](https://us5.datadoghq.com/integrations/prometheus?search=Prometheus).

Navigate to the agent download [page](https://us5.datadoghq.com/account/settings/agent/latest?platform=overview).

- Click on Windows. If you have more than one API key, you can select the one to use. We only have one and will use that one.
- Make sure of the region. The guide use "us5.datadoghq.com", but yours might vary depending on the selection when you created your Datadog [account](#sign-up-for-a-free-datadog-trial-account).
- Click Download Agent Installer. If asked, Choose a folder to save the download, else it will be saved in your default downloads folder.
- Run the installer (as Administrator) by opening datadog-agent-7-latest.amd64.msi.
- Follow the prompts, accept the license agreement, and enter your Datadog API key, enter your Datadog Region: us5.datadoghq.com 
- When the installation finishes, you are given the option to launch the Datadog Agent Manager. Launch the Datadog agent Manager

![Datadog-Agent-Windows-Setup](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/datadog-agent-windows-setup.png)

- Look for a green button at the top that says "Connected to agent". If not, follow the installation instructions again.
- Click on checks on the menu and select manage checks. Select Prometheus from the list.

![Datadog-Agent-Prometheus-Config](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/datadog-agent-prometheus-config.png)

Complete the following config for the remote Fusionauth server, in the right-hand pane:

```yaml
## All options defined here are available to all instances.
init_config:
  
instances:
- prometheus_url: https://<your fusionauth host>/api/prometheus/metrics
    namespace: Prometheus_remote_metrics #namespace to identify requests in datadog
    metrics:
      - '*'  #you can filter or add specific metrics here , see documentation. 
    headers:
      Authorization: '<your Fusionauth apikey?
      Content-Type: 'application/json'
```

- When the config is done click on Add check to save. Click on Restart Agent. You can confirm on the Checks/Checksummary screen if everything is running ok.

![Datadog-Agent-Prometheus-Check-Summary](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/datadog-agent-prometheus-check-summary.png)

To see the results in Datadog navigate to the Metrics Explorer on the Datadog website. You can use the namespace defined above in the config <InlineField>Prometheus_remote_metrics</InlineField> and add metrics in the metric explorer. Choose the last 15 minutes for the period. You will see that data being pulled from the Prometheus fusionauth endpoint.- Following the steps above when we created a [dashboard](#create-your-first-dashboard), you can easily add these metrics to the dashboards required.

![Datadog-Website-Metrics-Exploere-Prometheus](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/datadog-website-metrics-explorer-prometheus.png)

## Send Events With A Python App To Datadog

Datadog also provides an API whereby you can create cron jobs or services that run on your FusionAuth that provide additional/ custom events or logs to Datadog.

Below is a sample python appliaciont that just checks if a given FusionAuth host is alive/not alive and sent the status event to Datadog.

Run the following command before you try the script:

```bash
  pip install requests datadog-api-client
```

```python
import requests

from datadog_api_client import ApiClient, Configuration
from datadog_api_client.v1.api.events_api import EventsApi
from datadog_api_client.v1.model.event_create_request import EventCreateRequest
from datetime import datetime

# Get the current date and time
now = datetime.now()


def is_website_alive(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
        # Check if the response status code is 200 (OK)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return True
        else:
            return False
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        # If there was an issue (e.g., network error, timeout), the website is not reachable
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return False
    

formatted_now = now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")


url = "https://<your fusionauth/>"
if is_website_alive(url):
    status  = f"[{ formatted_now}] - {url} is alive. "
else:
    status = f"[{ formatted_now}] - {url} is not reachable."

#### here you can define your message/event
body = EventCreateRequest(
    title="FusionAuthStatusEvent",
    text=status,
    tags=[
        "FusionAuth:StatusEvent",
    ],
)



configuration = Configuration()

configuration.api_key["apiKeyAuth"] = "<your DataDog API KEY>"
configuration.server_variables["site"] = "us5.datadoghq.com" #your Region
configuration.api_key["appKeyAuth"] = "<your Application key if needed>"

with ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    api_instance = EventsApi(api_client)
    response = api_instance.create_event(body=body)

    print(response)
``` 

When you navigate [to](https://us5.datadoghq.com/event/overview) and click on Explorer, you will see the event that was logged with the script.

![DataDog-Custom-Events](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/datadog-custom-events.png)
Read more about all the possible API's [here](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/using-the-api/).

## Send Data To Datadog With The Opentelemetry Colector 

You can also use the open telemetry java colletor to push data from the Fusionauth host to Datadog.

You must modify the official FusionAuth Docker image to download the OpenTelemetry Java agent and change the script that starts FusionAuth. 
Configuration values for Java OpenTelemetry are described [here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/java/configuration).

Save the <InlineField>Dockerfile</InlineField> from the [FusionAuth official image](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/blob/master/docker/fusionauth/fusionauth-app/Dockerfile) to your computer. 

Edit the file. Above the paragraph labelled <InlineField>###### Start FusionAuth App</InlineField>, insert the code below.

```bash
##### NEW FOR OPENTELEMETRY #######################################################################
RUN mkdir -p /var/lib/apt/lists/partial \
    && chmod 755 /var/lib/apt/lists/partial \
    && apt update \
    && apt install -y ca-certificates \
    && cd /usr/local/fusionauth \
    && curl -L -o otel.jar https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/releases/download/v2.4.0/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar\
    && (head -n -1 /usr/local/fusionauth/fusionauth-app/bin/start.sh; echo 'exec "${JAVA_HOME}/bin/java" -javaagent:/usr/local/fusionauth/otel.jar -Dotel.resource.attributes=service.name=fusionauth -Dotel.traces.exporter=otlp -Dotel.exporter.otlp.endpoint=http://otel:4318 -cp "${CLASSPATH}" ${JAVA_OPTS} io.fusionauth.app.FusionAuthMain <&- >> "${LOG_DIR}/fusionauth-app.log" 2>&1') > temp.sh \
    && mv temp.sh /usr/local/fusionauth/fusionauth-app/bin/start.sh;
RUN chown fusionauth:fusionauth /usr/local/fusionauth/otel.jar /usr/local/fusionauth/fusionauth-app/bin/start.sh \
    && chmod +x /usr/local/fusionauth/fusionauth-app/bin/start.sh
```

- This code edits <InlineField>start.sh</InlineField>, which is the command run when the container starts, to start FusionAuth using OpenTelemetry. 
- The command takes the head of the file (all lines except the last), and writes the new command to the end of the file.

By default, the OpenTelemetry Java agent sends data to the OpenTelemetry collector at http://localhost:4317. It was changed to send data to the container, at http://otel:4318.

Build the Dockerfile into a new image to use in place of the official FusionAuth one.

```sh
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t faimage .
```

Modify the <InlineField>docker-compose-yaml</InlineField> file from the FusionAuth [five-minute guide](/docs/quickstarts/5-minute-setup-guide) to have the content below. 
The Opentelemetery collector is now included in your compose file. 

``` yaml
# OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib
  otel:
    image: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:latest
    volumes:
      - ./otel-collector.yml:/etc/otel-collector.yml
    command: ["--config=/etc/otel-collector.yml"]
    #,"--feature-gates=-exporter.datadogexporter.DisableAPMStats"]
    ports:
      - "1888:1888"   # pprof extension
      - "8888:8888"   # Prometheus metrics exposed by the collector
      - "8889:8889"   # Prometheus exporter metrics
      - "13133:13133" # health_check extension
      - "4317:4317"   # OTLP gRPC receiver
      - "4318:4318"   # OTLP gRPC receiver
      - "55679:55679" # zpages extension
    environment:
      - OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_ENDPOINT=http://otel:4318/v1/logs
      - OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT=http://otel:4318
      - OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=http://otel:4318/v1/traces  
    networks:
      - db_net
      
    depends_on:
      - db
      - search
      - fusionauth

```

You must also configure the otel-collector.yml file for use with this container. This file is passed into the container through the docker-compose yaml.

```yaml
receivers:
  hostmetrics:
      scrapers:
        load:
        cpu:
        disk:
        filesystem:
        memory:
        network:
        paging:
        # process:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      http:
        #endpoint: "localhost:4318"
      grpc:
        #endpoint: "localhost:4317"
processors:
  batch:
    send_batch_max_size: 100
    send_batch_size: 10
    timeout: 10s
    
connectors:
  datadog/connector:

exporters:
  datadog/exporter:
    api:
      site: "us5.datadoghq.com"   #<make sure of your region>
      key: "<your Datadog API key>" 
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [datadog/connector, datadog/exporter]
    metrics:
      receivers: [hostmetrics, otlp, datadog/connector] #// The connector provides the metrics to your metrics pipeline
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [datadog/exporter]

```

Start the docker-compose with

```bash
  docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yaml up -d

#if you want to monitor the progress
# docker-compose logs --follow
```

### Visualize The Opentelemetery Metrics In Datadog

<Aside type="note">
  To visualize the open-telemetry metrics the OpenTelemetry integration must be [installed](https://us5.datadoghq.com/integrations?integrationId=otel).
  You can follow the same steps as [Adding OpenMetrics Integration in Datadog.](#add-openmetrics-integration-in-datadog).
</Aside>
- Navigate to dashboards. Click on dashboard list. Click on OpenTelemetry Host Metrics Dashboard
- If you followed the guide correctly you will see some metrics on the graps
[DataDog-opentelemetry-Dashboard](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/dataDog-opentelemetry-dashboard.png)

## Conclusion

The guide looked at various ways to get data into Datadog from a FusionAuth instance.

- The Datadog agent could be installed and configured with various integrations inside the FusionAuth docker container.
- The OpenTelemetry collector can be installed inside the docker container to collect data with the Linux collector.
- The Datadog agent can be installed on an external host to monitorFusionAuth Prometheus Endpoint.
- You looked at using the API in a Python app to push sample events/logs to Datadog.

 You can visualize collected metrics in dashboards created on the Datadog website. It is fair to say many metrics are available from fusionauth to Datadog. Should you need any others, you can create your own using the API.
