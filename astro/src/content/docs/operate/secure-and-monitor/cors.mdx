## Overview

[Cross-Origin Resources Sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) (CORS) provides a mechanism to control permission
to resources on a server on a different domain or origin than the originating request. Practically, this means that in order to make HTTP requests in JavaScript to FusionAuth when the request
is coming from a different domain, CORS needs to be configured to allow the request.

Most of the time this works as designed, you do not need to think much about CORS configuration. In some cases you may find the configuration is restricting the way you want to use FusionAuth, especially if you are building out browser-based single page applications (SPAs). If this happens, FusionAuth allows you to modify or enable the CORS filter.

## Configuration

<Aside type="version">
Available Since Version 1.8.0.
</Aside>

To modify the default CORS configuration navigate to <strong>Settings -> System -> CORS</strong>. Please utilize caution when modifying this configuration, with great power comes great responsibility.

### Form Fields

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Enabled">
    When enabled, the CORS filter will process requests made to FusionAuth. The default setting disables the CORS filter, and all CORS requests will be denied.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Allow credentials">
    The `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` response header values as described by [MDN Access-Control-Allow-Credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Credentials).
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Allowed headers">
    The `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header values as described by [MDN Access-Control-Allow-Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Headers).
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Allowed methods">
    The `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header values as described by [MDN Access-Control-Allow-Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Methods).
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Allowed origins">
    The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header values as described by [MDN Access-Control-Allow-Origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin). If the wildcard `*` is specified, no additional domains may be specified.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Exposed headers">
    The `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` response header values as described by [MDN Access-Control-Expose-Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Expose-Headers).
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Preflight max age">
    The `Access-Control-Max-Age` response header values as described by [MDN Access-Control-Max-Age](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Max-Age).
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Debug enabled" since="1.25.0">
    Enable debug to create an event log to assist you in debugging `403` HTTP response codes. When enabled, a Debug event log will be created when the FusionAuth CORS filter returns a `403` detailing the reason for the response to assist you in configuration.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

### CORS Excluded URI Paths
We have excluded some paths from FusionAuth CORS filtering in order to force same-origin browser requests on these paths. The following are the URL patterns excluded from our CORS filter.

* `/account*`
* `/admin*`
* `/support*`
* `/ajax*`

## Default Configuration

The following reference has been provided in case you want to return the CORS filter configuration to the original values provided by FusionAuth.

{/* Internal Note: This needs to match our shipped CORS configuration. See Migration_1_8_0.java */}
