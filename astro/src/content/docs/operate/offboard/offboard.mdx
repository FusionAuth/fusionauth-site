## Introduction

This guide explains how to export your user data from FusionAuth to prepare it for migration to another system. Reasons for exporting your data include:
- Swapping from FusionAuth to another authentication service.
- Wondering if you start using FusionAuth how easy it is to leave.
- Wanting to export your users into a data warehouse for analytical investigation.

If you'd like to follow along with this guide, please install Docker. You will start a new FusionAuth instance with a sample user and see how to export their data.

If you already use FusionAuth, you can export your data from that instance.

For integration of FusionAuth with other services, such as exporting user data into a dataware house with Twilio Segment, using monitoring services like Prometheus or Elastic, or , please see those guides.
