## Overview

FusionAuth is an architectural component integrated into your applications or systems. Such integration means that when changes to FusionAuth occur, it can negatively affect your application. As developers ourselves, we strive to maintain backwards compatibility. 

However, there are times when features or functionality must be removed. FusionAuth has [extensive release notes](/docs/release-notes/), which are the source of truth for changes to the FusionAuth system, and any deprecated features will be listed there.

However, beyond adding them to the release notes, as a measure of our commitment to backwards compatibility, FusionAuth commits to certain steps and time before removing.

### What Is A Feature

Here are examples of features that will follow this policy.

* A documented API endpoint or parameter
* A documented way to authenticate against an API
* A documented themeable page

### What Is Not A Feature

Anything not documented in the [FusionAuth technical documentation](/docs) is not considered a feature.

## Deprecation Steps 

Before removing a feature, the FusionAuth team takes the following steps:

* The feature is marked as deprecated in the documentation.
* In the first release where the behavior is deprecated, the deprecation is noted in the release notes.
* The documentation deprecation note remains for three full releases.
* In the fourth release, any documentation about the feature is removed from the FusionAuth technical documentation. Blog posts or forum posts about this feature may remain.
* In the same release where the feature documentation is removed, the deprecation is again noted in the release notes.
* The documentation removal lasts for three full releases.
* In the seventh full release, the feature is removed.

## Example Removal Timeline

Suppose the current release is 1.52.0 and FusionAuth needed to remove feature ABC in the next release. Here is what that feature removal timeline would look like.

| FusionAuth Version    | Feature ABC Changes | Release Notes Updates |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| 1.52.0  | No change | N/A |
| 1.52.1  | No change | N/A |
| 1.53.0  | Feature documentation marked as deprecated. | Deprecation announced in release notes. |
| 1.53.1  | Feature documentation remains marked as deprecated. | N/A |
| 1.53.2  | Feature documentation remains marked as deprecated. | N/A |
| 1.54.0  | Feature documentation remains marked as deprecated. | N/A |
| 1.55.0  | Feature documentation remains marked as deprecated. | N/A |
| 1.56.0  | Feature documentation removed. | Deprecation and documentation removal announced in release notes. |
| 1.57.0  | Feature documentation remains removed. | N/A |
| 1.57.1  | Feature documentation remains removed. | N/A |
| 1.58.0  | Feature documentation remains removed. | N/A |
| 1.59.0  | Feature removed. | Feature removal announced in release notes. |

## Policy Exceptions

If this is a change adding new functionality which requires changes to your integration, the FusionAuth team won't follow this policy. This only applies to deprecation and removal of functionality.

If a feature impacts performance or security, FusionAuth reserves the right to deprecate features in a different manner than outlined in this policy. For example, a feature introduced in version 1.52.0 that negatively impacts performance may be removed in version 1.52.1.
