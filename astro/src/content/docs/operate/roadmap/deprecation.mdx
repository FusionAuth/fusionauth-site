## Overview

FusionAuth is an architectural component which is integrated into your applications or systems. That deep level of integration means that when changes to FusionAuth occur, it can affect your application. As developers ourselves, we strive to maintain backwards compatibility. However, there are times when features need to be removed.

FusionAuth has [extensive release notes](/docs/release-notes/), which are the source of truth for changes to the FusionAuth system, and any deprecations will be listed there.

## Deprecation Steps 

If a feature is to be removed, the FusionAuth team will take the following steps:

* The feature is marked as deprecated in the documentation at the point of a release. 
* In the first release where the behavior is marked as deprecated, the deprecation will be noted in the release notes.
* The documentation deprecation note will remain for three full releases.
* In the fourth release, the feature will be removed from the documentation.
* In the release where the feauture is removed from the documentation, the removal will be noted in the release notes.
* The removal will last for three full releases.
* In the seventh full release, the feature will be removed.

## Example Feature Removal Timeline

Suppose that FusionAuth needed to remove feature ABC in the next release, and the current release is 1.52.0.

Here is what that feature removal timeline would look like.

| Version    | Action On Feature ABC | Action On Release Notes |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| 1.52.0  | No change | N/A |
| 1.52.1  | No change | N/A |
| 1.53.0  | Feature documentation marked as deprecated. | Deprecation announced in release notes. |
| 1.53.1  | Feature documentation remains marked as deprecated. | N/A |
| 1.53.2  | Feature documentation remains marked as deprecated. | N/A |
| 1.54.0  | Feature documentation remains marked as deprecated. | N/A |
| 1.55.0  | Feature documentation remains marked as deprecated. | N/A |
| 1.56.0  | Feature documentation removed. | Deprecation and documentation removal announced in release notes. |
| 1.57.0  | Feature documentation remains removed. | N/A |
| 1.57.1  | Feature documentation remains removed. | N/A |
| 1.58.0  | Feature documentation remains removed. | N/A |
| 1.59.0  | Feature removed. | Feature removal announced in release notes. |

## Exceptions

If this is a change adding new functionality which requires changes to your integration, the FusionAuth team won't follow this. This policy only applies to deprecation and removal of functionality.

If a feature impacts performance or security, FusionAuth reserves the right to deprecate features more quickly than outlined above.
