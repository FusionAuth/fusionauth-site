You must create an API key either manually or via Kickstart. There is no way to create the initial API key using Terraform.

The Terraform implementation is not currently at parity with the client libraries and the REST API. If you run into any discrepancies that affect your usages, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/FusionAuth/terraform-provider-fusionauth).
