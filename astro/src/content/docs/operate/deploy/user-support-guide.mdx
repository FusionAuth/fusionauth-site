## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for basic operations in the FusionAuth admin UI. This is intended for customer service representatives supporting end users with login problems, resetting passwords or removing account lockout, and resolving other authentication related issues.

This guide also contains information on customizing the admin UI forms which may be helpful to developers working on enabling customer service representatives.

## Adding Users And Assigning Roles In The FusionAuth Admin UI

The FusionAuth administrative user interface allows you to assign one of several built-in roles to users registered with the FusionAuth admin application. These roles control access to functionality within the FusionAuth administrative user interface. Refer to the  [roles](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/roles#fusionauth-application-roles) documentation for more information about roles in FusionAuth.

Customer service reps are likely to be assigned one of two roles:

* `user_support_viewer`: Users assigned this role can view user information in the FusionAuth admin UI, but cannot make any changes.
* `user_support_manager`: A special role tuned for tier 1 technical support personnel that has a mix of capabilities.

To add a user in FusionAuth, you need to have a `user_manager`, `user_support_manager`, or `admin` role.

Only a user with `user_manager` or `admin` permissions can assign a role to an existing user.

### Adding A New User

To add a new user, log in to the FusionAuth admin UI using your admin credentials and select <strong>Users</strong> from the left sidebar of the dashboard.

Click on the green <Icon name="plus" /> icon to open the "Add User" form:

<img src="/img/docs/operate/deploy/new-user-form.png" alt="image" width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

Complete the fields for the new user. You can choose to set the userâ€™s password or let the user set their own password by toggling the <InlineUIElement>Send email to set up password</InlineUIElement> button.

Click on the <Icon name="save" /> icon in the top right corner to save.

### Assign A Role To A User

On the "Users" page, search for the user you will assign the role to and click on the <Icon name="user" /> icon in the action column to open the user details page.

Scroll down and click the <InlineUIElement>Add registration</InlineUIElement> button.

<img src="/img/docs/operate/deploy/add-registration.png" alt="image" width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

Select an <InlineField>Application</InlineField> if you have configured multiple applications.

<img src="/img/docs/operate/deploy/select-application.png" alt="image" width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

On the "Add User Registration" page, scroll down to the <InlineField>Roles</InlineField>. Select the role to assign to the user, in this case, <InlineUIElement>User support manager (user_support_manager)</InlineUIElement>.

<img src="/img/docs/operate/deploy/roles.png" alt="image" width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

Save your changes by clicking the <Icon name="save" /> icon.

## Basic Authentication Operations

The FusionAuth admin UI provides a user-friendly interface for performing basic authentication operations. Here are some common tasks a user account manager may need to perform.

### Send A Password Reset

Use the Password Reset operation to help an end user regain access to their account.

* Log in to the FusionAuth admin UI.
* Navigate to <strong>Users</strong> and search for the user whose password needs to be reset.
* Click on the <Icon name="user" /> icon to open the user's details page.
* Click on the down arrow next to the <InlineUIElement>Edit user</InlineUIElement> button to open a dropdown with user management options.
* Select <InlineUIElement>Send password reset</InlineUIElement> to send password reset instructions to the end user by email.

<img src="/img/docs/operate/deploy/send-password-reset.png" alt="image" width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

* Confirm the password reset by clicking <InlineUIElement>Submit</InlineUIElement> in the popup.

<img src="/img/docs/operate/deploy/confirm-reset.png" alt="image" width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

### Require A Password Change

You might need a user to change their password for security reasons without sending a password reset email. You can use this feature to require the user to change their password the next time they log in.

* Log in to the FusionAuth admin UI.
* Navigate to <strong>Users</strong> and search for the user whose password needs to be changed.
* Click on the <Icon name="user" /> icon to open the user's details page.
* Click on the down arrow next to the <InlineUIElement>Edit user</InlineUIElement> button to open a dropdown with user management options.
* Select <InlineUIElement>Require password change</InlineUIElement> from the dropdown.

<img src="/img/docs/operate/deploy/require-password-change.png" alt="image" width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

* Click <InlineUIElement>Submit</InlineUIElement> in the "Confirm require password change" popup.

<img src="/img/docs/operate/deploy/confirm-change.png" alt="image" width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />


### Verify User Information

You might need to verify a user's information for security purposes or to ensure up-to-date user data.

* Log in to the FusionAuth admin UI.
* Navigate to <strong>Users</strong> and search for the user whose information needs to be updated.
* Click on the <Icon name="user" /> icon to open the user's details page.
* Here you can view user information such as  <InlineField>Email</InlineField> address, <InlineField>Mobile Phone</InlineField> number, <InlineField>Birthdate</InlineField>, and <InlineField>Username</InlineField>.

<img src="/img/docs/operate/deploy/verify.png" alt="image" width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

* To update the information click the <InlineUIElement>Edit user</InlineUIElement> button to open the "Edit User" form.

<img src="/img/docs/operate/deploy/edit-user.png" alt="image" width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

Save your changes by clicking the <Icon name="save" /> icon.


### Log A User Out

You might need to log a user out of their account for security reasons, following a data breach, or to perform system maintenance. 

* Log in to the FusionAuth admin UI using your admin credentials.
* Navigate to <strong>Users</strong> and search for the user who needs to be logged out.
* Click on the <Icon name="user" /> icon to open the user's details page.
* Select the <strong>Sessions</strong> tab to view the user's current sessions.
* Click on the <Icon name="trash" /> icon to delete a single session or <InlineUIElement>Delete all sessions</InlineUIElement> to clear all the user's sessions and the user will be logged out.

<img src="/img/docs/operate/deploy/sessions.png" alt="image" width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />



### Delete A User

<Aside type="caution">
The Delete user action is destructive and cannot be reversed. Instead, FusionAuth recommends that you lock (deactivate) the user which is not destructive and may be reversed. Navigate to <ScrollRef target="Lock Or Unlock A User Account" /> for instructions on locking and unlocking an account.
</Aside>

### Lock Or Unlock A User Account

You might need to lock a user account for security or troubleshooting purposes. 

* Log in to the FusionAuth admin UI.

## Customizing Admin UI Forms

<PremiumPlanBlurb />

You can customize the forms and fields used in the FusionAuth admin UI. While the instructions below document how to do so using the admin UI, you can also create and manage these forms via [the Form APIs](/docs/apis/custom-forms/forms).

### The User Form

<AdminUserForm />

### The Registration Form

<AdminUserRegistrationForm />

### User Management Outside Of The Admin UI

If you want to create customer user support forms because custom forms don't meet your needs, you can use [the APIs](/docs/apis/) or one of the [Client Libraries](/docs/sdks/) to build any workflow you desire.

For instance, suppose you wanted to take the following actions in one screen:

* create a user
* add them to a group
* verify their identity against an external database
* register them to an application with a role based on their identity
* ensure they had first name, last name and favorite color set

In this case, a custom form built against the FusionAuth APIs is the best path forward. The FusionAuth admin UI, while flexible, is not capable of this level of customization.

## Privilege Escalation

If you grant someone the `user_manager` role, they can then create a user, set the user's email address and password, and grant that user the `admin` or any other FusionAuth role. They could then log in as that user and have `admin` privileges.

This is working as designed, as the `user_manager` role gives full control of all users to any account which is granted it. Read more about this design choice in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2170).

To prevent this escalation, use the `user_support_manager` role, which can add users, but cannot register a user for the FusionAuth admin UI application.

<Aside type="caution">
Prefer the `user_support_manager` role to the `user_manager` role to avoid undesired privilege escalation.
