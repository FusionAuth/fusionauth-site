FusionAuth stores almost all state in its database. For clustered environments, the following interactions may occur between nodes:

* Cache invalidations.
* When an admin navigates to <Breadcrumb>System -> Log</Breadcrumb> and the logs are viewed or downloaded, each node may receive a log retrieval request.

FusionAuth occasionally needs to communicate with other nodes in a cluster. Each node is identified by the `fusionauth-app.url` value, which is either automatically assigned or manually configured. 

This node-to-node communication can take place over TLS or, if you are running FusionAuth on a private backplane, HTTP. If using TLS, the TLS certificates must be in the Java trust store or the communication will fail and you may see undesirable behavior such as slow start up times. You can use a certificate signed by a certificate authority, or, if using self-signed certificates, add them to the Java trust store.

There may be future features implemented relying on interactions between nodes. These may not be documented if used for system internals.
