When moving themes from one environment to another, the theme logic and look and feel may be the same, but the assets may be different. FusionAuth does not resolve any environment variables in the themes, or anything other than [what is documented](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/template-variables).

You can set your own variables in the [Helpers](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/helpers) template using [assign](https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/ref_directive_assign.html) that can be used in other templates. You could use a templating language like jinja to build the `Helpers` template at build time and then a script to load it during deploy.

You may also use the `tenant.data` field, as the `tenant` object will always be available for any theme. For example, if you have your development assets at `dev.example.com/assets` and your production assets at `prod.example.com/assets` you could set a variable in `tenant.data`: `tenant.data.themes.asset_url` to be either of these values, then reference `${tenant.data.themes.asset_url}/logo.png` (for your logo) in your templates.
