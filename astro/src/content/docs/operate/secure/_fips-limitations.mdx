Running FusionAuth in FIPS compliant mode has limitations:

* FIPS mode may only be enabled on new installations of FusionAuth. An existing FusionAuth installation cannot be converted to run in FIPS mode.
* All nodes in a cluster must be running in FIPS mode. Any node that is started in non-FIPS mode will automatically shutdown during the initialization process and write an error to the logs.
* Customers must use a FIPS compliant database and search engine. FusionAuth does not provide the database or the search engine. It is your responsibility to use a FIPS compliant version of PostgreSQL, MySQL, and/or OpenSearch.
* Currently, FIPS mode is only available for self-hosted instances.

<Aside type="note">
It's important to note that the FIPS version of Bouncy Castle doesn't directly prohibit the use of some weak algorithms, such as MD5. This is in compliance with FIPS 140-3, since in some cases MD5 is allowed. Therefore, FusionAuth is unable to prevent the use of MD5 for password hashing in any meaningful way.

Based on this limitation, it is your responsibility to ensure that the FusionAuth is configured to use algorithms that are FIPS compliant, such as PBKDF2 or BCrypt.
