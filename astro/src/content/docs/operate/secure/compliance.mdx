## Overview

FusionAuth is in the process of conforming with various standards including the [Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)](https://www.nist.gov/standardsgov/compliance-faqs-federal-information-processing-standards-fips) and [FedRAMP](https://www.fedramp.gov).

While full certification is not yet available, FusionAuth conforms and self-certifies compliance as appropriate. Since most compliance frameworks restrict encryption standards, this is currently the primary focus area.

Below you will find the status of FusionAuth's compliance as well as details about the encryption in use.

## Cryptographic and Encryption Functionality

Here is a non-exhaustive list of cryptographic and encryption functionality FusionAuth uses:

* signing
* encryption
* password hashing

### Signing

FusionAuth signs the items below using various cryptographic signature algorithms including HMAC, RSA, ECDSA, and EdDSA:

* JWT signing
* XML signing for SAML
* Webhook signing
* WebAuthN (Passkeys) signing

### Encryption

FusionAuth encrypts the items below using various cryptographic algorithms including AES, RSA, and ECDSA:

* XML encryption for SAML
* Various encryption of plain-text passwords prior to being hashed
* Encryption for all cookies that contain data
* TLS connections to the database and search engine
* TLS connections to Reactor (advanced threat detection and breached password detection)

### Password Hashing

FusionAuth hashes the items below using various cryptographic algorithms including bcrypt, PBKDF2, MD5, SHA, and others:

* Passwords
* API keys

<Aside type="caution">
  FusionAuth allows custom password hashing algorithms to be enabled via our plugin system. These custom algorithms are not checked for compliance.

  FusionAuth also allows the password hashing algorithm to be changed per tenant, Application, or User. FusionAuth cannot certify that the algorithms used are secure or conform to any particular compliance framework.

## FIPS Compliance

<EnterprisePlanBlurb />

Beginning with version `1.62.0`, FusionAuth supports a runtime mode that provides compliance with FIPS 140-3 cryptographic module restrictions. 

This support is provided by [Bouncy Castle's FIPS compliant library](https://www.bouncycastle.org/download/bouncy-castle-java-fips/), and is configurable via the `fusionauth-app.fips.enabled` configuration parameter (i.e. in `fusionauth.properties`, a command-line parameter, or an environment variable).

### Details

The FIPS support in FusionAuth covers the main components of the FIPS 140-3 Level 1 standard. Here's a list that outlines the main areas within FusionAuth that change when FIPS mode is enabled:

* Passwords must be a minimum of 14 characters in length
* The password used to connect to the database must be a minimum of 14 characters in length
* RSA keys must be a minimum of 2048 bits in length
* Deprecated algorithms, such as RSA 1024, are not allowed

Some items might provide validation errors, such as creating a Tenant with a password length minimum less than 14 characters. However, there are other features that might result in `500` responses from the API, such as importing invalid keys. Regardless, FusionAuth prevents most non-FIPS compliant configurations (see the note under Limitations for exceptions).

Additionally, FusionAuth is not FIPS certified. We've done our best to ensure FusionAuth is using FIPS compliant libraries and implementing the required FIPS validation, such as password lengths. However, we make no guarantees that FusionAuth is fully FIPS compliant or FIPS certified.
