This guide will show you how to enable SCIM for your tenant (multiple FusionAuth applications), how to create and delete users for applications using the SCIM protocol, and how to map user details using a lambda.

This guide is a concrete example that integrates the information in the following FusionAuth documentation:
- [Overview of SCIM in FusionAuth](https://fusionauth.io/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/scim)
- [FusionAuth SCIM API](https://fusionauth.io/docs/apis/scim)
- [FusionAuth SCIM API for Users](https://fusionauth.io/docs/apis/scim/scim-user)
- [Lambdas to map SCIM](https://fusionauth.io/docs/extend/code/lambdas/scim-user-request-converter)

You should read the overview article before continuing. The other pages you don't need to read until you want to manage users in more advanced ways that aren't not shown in this guide.

<Aside type="note" title="When to use SCIM?">
FusionAuth has an alternative to SCIM, [the user API](https://fusionauth.io/docs/apis/users), which allows you to provision users with simple HTTP calls. If you're looking for an easy way to automatically create users in FusionAuth, the API is a better choice. Use SCIM in FA only when you have an existing user-management system in your organization that is primarily designed to work with SCIM. SCIM is a secure and full-featured standard, but does require more work to configure than the user API.

If you're looking for a way to automatically create a set of users when installing FA, then you can use [Kickstart](https://fusionauth.io/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/kickstart), which is easier than both the API and SCIM.
