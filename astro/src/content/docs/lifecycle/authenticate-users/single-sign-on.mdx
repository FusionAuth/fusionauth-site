This guide will walk you through setting up single sign-on (SSO) between two web applications using FusionAuth as their common authentication and authorization server. You will use the hosted login pages for your login form.

These are the applications you'll build:

* Pied Piper
* Hooli

At the end of this guide, both applications will be running. You can then log in to Pied Piper. Then if you visit Hooli, you will be automatically signed in to that second application. If you sign out from either of them, you'll be signed out from both.

This pattern scales to any number of applications, and can include commercial off the shelf apps. If you have a suite of applications, you can provide a seamless single sign-on experience for all your users. 

<Aside type="note">
This guide illustrates a single sign-on scenario where FusionAuth is the system of record for your users.

If, instead, another datastore is your system of record, check out the [Identity Providers](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/identity-providers/) documentation, which allows users to authenticate with third party login. This includes both social sign-on providers like Google as well as providers implementing standards such as OIDC.

## Concepts

It's worth spending a bit of time to discuss sessions. Sessions are how servers know they've seen the client, usually a browser, before. They are usually implemented with cookies, but the actual technologies used don't matter. In the SSO scenario, the following sessions exist:

* FusionAuth's session, also known as the single sign-on session
* The Pied Piper application's session
* The Hooli application's session

If a session doesn't exist for a given application, or expected values aren't present in it, then the session must be created or updated after the user has presented valid credentials. For FusionAuth, the credentials are a username and password, but for the other applications, the credential is a valid FusionAuth token. 

## Request Flow Diagrams

Here's the flow of a single sign-on login request.

<SSOLogin alt="Single sign-on request flow during login." />

Here's the flow of the corresponding logout request.

<SSOLogout alt="Single sign-on request flow during logout." />

Above, note that FusionAuth automatically logs the user out of the Hooli application after the user chooses to log out of the Pied Piper application. The user does not have to log out of multiple applications. The logout URLs will be called for each application in this tenant, allowing you to transparently sign the user out of three, five or ten web applications. However, you can disable this setting too.

## Prerequisites

To walk through this guide, you will need to have FusionAuth and Node installed. For FusionAuth installation instructions, please visit [the 5 minute setup guide](/docs/quickstarts/5-minute-setup-guide).

## Set Up The Domains

In order to properly exercise single sign-on, applications need to live on different domains, or at least different paths. If you, for instance, set up two Node applications at `localhost:3000` and `localhost:3001`, browser sessions won't be separated and the SSO functionality won't work as intended. Cookies typically don't differ based on ports, so you'll see confusing behavior.

You can, however, easily set up two local domains. Edit your hosts file; on macOS, this file lives at `/etc/hosts`. Look for a line starting with `127.0.0.1`, which is the address of your computer.

Add the following text to that line:

```ini title="Additions to the /etc/hosts file"
 hooli.local piedpiper.local
```

You want it to look something like this after editing:

```ini title="The modified localhost line in /etc/hosts file"
127.0.0.1       localhost hooli.local piedpiper.local
```

Later, when you have the code running, you can type `http://piedpiper.local:3000` or `http://hooli.local:3001` into your browser's address bar and the local Node application will serve the request.

## Configure The Applications In FusionAuth

Next, create and configure the applications in FusionAuth. You can do this via the API, but in this guide it'll be accomplished through the administrative user interface. 

Navigate to <Breadcrumb>Applications</Breadcrumb> and create two new applications. Configure the following for each application:

* <InlineField>Name</InlineField>
* <InlineField>Authorized redirect URL</InlineField>
* <InlineField>Logout URL</InlineField>

The <InlineField>Name</InlineField> is used for display purposes. 

The <InlineField>Authorized redirect URL</InlineField> lists all the valid redirect URLs that the application is capable of handling. In this case there is only one per application, but if you want your user to be sent to different landing pages based on where they signed in or some other parameter, you can add more. 

<InlineField>Logout URL</InlineField> is where the user is sent if they log out from this application. It is also a URL requested by FusionAuth if you have multi-application logout enabled. The value of <InlineField>Logout behavior</InlineField> controls this. The default value of `All applications` means that when a user signs out of one FusionAuth application in a tenant, they are automatically signed out of all of them.

For the Pied Piper application, the configuration values will be:

* <InlineField>Name</InlineField>: Pied Piper
* <InlineField>Authorized redirect URL</InlineField>: `http://piedpiper.local:3000/oauth-redirect`
* <InlineField>Logout URL</InlineField>: `http://piedpiper.local:3000/endsession`

For the Hooli application, the values will be:

* <InlineField>Name</InlineField>: Hooli
* <InlineField>Authorized redirect URL</InlineField>: `http://hooli.local:3001/oauth-redirect`
* <InlineField>Logout URL</InlineField>: `http://hooli.local:3001/endsession`

All of these will be configured on the <Breadcrumb>OAuth</Breadcrumb> tab. 

Here's what the Pied Piper application might look like when properly configured:

<img src="/img/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/add-application-docs.png" alt="Example of configured application." width="1200" />

Click "Save" for each application.

View each application by clicking the green magnifying glass when looking at the list of applications and note the `Client Id` and `Client Secret` values:

<img src="/img/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/application-config-docs.png" alt="Looking up the Client Id and Client Secret values." width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

## Set Up The User

You'll need to make sure that a FusionAuth user is registered for both applications you created. You can use the default user created when installing FusionAuth or any other user. Here's an example of what the user details of a user registered for both the Pied Piper and Hooli applications will look like:

<img src="/img/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/user-registration-docs.png" alt="Registering a user for both applications." width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

## Set Up The Code

Next, set up the code. Both of the applications in this guide are written in Node, but the logic will be the same no matter the language. This [code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-example-node-sso), feel free to clone the repository.

Set up two Node applications, one for Pied Piper and one for Hooli. In this guide, the applications are very similar, so let's create the Pied Piper application first. Once this is running, you can copy most of the code for the Hooli application. 

First off, make a `pied-piper` directory and change into it.

```shell script title="Creating Pied Piper directory"
mkdir pied-piper && cd pied-piper
```

### Required packages

Set up your needed packages. Here's what the `package.json` file should look like:

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/pied-piper/package.json"}
  lang="javascript" 
  title="package.json" />

Go ahead and install the needed modules:

```shell script title="Installing needed modules"
npm install
```

### The Express Server

This guide uses express for each application and the [typescript client](/docs/sdks/typescript) for interactions with the FusionAuth API. Create an `app.js` file; this is what will be executed when the server starts.

This is a pretty standard express application which uses pug and sessions. It reads routes from files in the `routes` directory and views from the `views` directory.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/pied-piper/app.js"}
  lang="javascript" 
  title="app.js" />

The session length for this application is 60 seconds; the `maxAge` value is in milliseconds. When the node application's session expires, it will redirect the end user to FusionAuth. If the single sign-on session has not expired, the user will be transparently redirected back. If it has expired, the user must re-authenticate.

### The `www` script

The next step is to create a script which starts up express. Place the contents of this file in `bin/www`.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/pied-piper/bin/www"}
  lang="javascript" 
  title="bin/www" />

This script is what running `npm start` actually executes.

This code isn't that interesting with regards to single sign-on but is included for completeness. 

It looks for a port from the environment or uses `3000` as the default. It also registers some error handling code. Then it starts up a server listening on that port, based on configuration from `app.js`.'

### The .env File

Here's the `.env` file, which should be placed at `.env`:

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/pied-piper/.env"}
  lang="properties" 
  title="The .env File" />

This contains configuration settings such as the Client Id and Client Secret. Make sure to update it with the correct values you've copied in the [Configure The Applications In FusionAuth](#configure-the-applications-in-fusionauth) section.

Next, build out the `indexRouter` code referenced from the `app.js` file above.

### The Index Route

Here's the entire `index.js` file, which should be placed at `routes/index.js`:

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/pied-piper/routes/index.js"}
  lang="javascript" 
  title="routes/index.js" />

This code handles a number of paths. Let's look at the code in more detail.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/pied-piper/routes/index.js"}
  tags="constants"
  lang="javascript" 
  title="Constants section" />

The top of the `index.js` file has configuration values and some needed constants. 

The `clientId` and `clientSecret` are the values noted in the administrative user interface when you created the application in FusionAuth. The `fusionAuthURL` value needs to match your FusionAuth location, typically `http://localhost:9011`. If the FusionAuth server is running at a different hostname, update that.

The first argument to the FusionAuth client creation is `noapikeyneeded` because the client interactions this application performs do not require an API key. If you extend these applications to update user data or make other privileged API calls, you'll need to change that value to a [real API key](/docs/apis/authentication#managing-api-keys).

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/pied-piper/routes/index.js"}
  tags="homepageroute"
  lang="javascript" 
  title="Home page route" />

In this SSO implementation, users can't view the homepage if they aren't signed in. This is a design choice you can make. The code checks for the presence of a user in the session and if it isn't present, the user is redirected to the FusionAuth login page. 

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/pied-piper/routes/index.js"}
  tags="loginpageroute"
  lang="javascript" 
  title="Login page route" />

This page is available to users who are not logged in. For this guide, the only information on this page is a login link, but for a real application you'd probably want to entice the user to register or log in.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/pied-piper/routes/index.js"}
  tags="logoutpageroute"
  lang="javascript" 
  title="Logout page route" />

This route removes the user object from the session and then redirects to the FusionAuth logout URL. 

Recall that there are three sessions present in this system: the FusionAuth session and one for each application. This route invalidates the local node application's session and then sends the browser to FusionAuth's logout URL, which will invalidate both the FusionAuth session and all other Node application sessions. 

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/pied-piper/routes/index.js"}
  tags="endsessionroute"
  lang="javascript" 
  title="End session route" />

This route is what FusionAuth requests when a user logs out from any other application in this tenant. If a user is in the Hooli application and logs out, they will be signed out from the Pied Piper application as well. You configured this endpoint in the FusionAuth application details; FusionAuth is responsible for calling this endpoint. This is a separate endpoint from the `/logout` endpoint because in this request, the browser needs to end up on a page accessible to unauthenticated users, but in the `/logout` case, the user needs to be sent to FusionAuth. 

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/pied-piper/routes/index.js"}
  tags="oauthredirectroute"
  lang="javascript" 
  title="OAuth redirect route" />

This route is responsible for catching the authorization code request from FusionAuth after the user has signed in. It retrieves an access token and from that gathers the user data. This code ensures that the user is registered for this application, and then places the user data in the session. 

Implementation of features that might cause a user to want to log in are left as an exercise for the reader.

### Views

Next, create the views. Each of these live in the `views` subdirectory. First, the layout view, which looks like this:

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/pied-piper/views/layout.pug"}
  lang="pug" 
  title="Layout view" />

The content is displayed using the `block content` directive. Above it is a menu which lets users switch between both applications.

Next, the login view:

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/pied-piper/views/login.pug"}
  lang="pug" 
  title="Login view" />

This is where you'd put information about your application for unauthorized users.

Then, create the index view:

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/pied-piper/views/index.pug"}
  lang="pug" 
  title="Index view" />

This welcomes the user by name. If you were building a more complicated application, this is where you would put functionality that required a user to be authenticated..

There is some CSS in this application too; the CSS is available in the GitHub repository, but won't be covered here.

### Start It Up

Start the Pied Piper application on port 3000 after you've built the above files.

```shell script title="Starting up the Pied Piper application"
PORT=3000 npm start
```

Next, create the sibling Hooli application.

### Hooli application

In real life, these applications would have different functionality. For this guide, they are going to be similar. The only changes you need to make for the Hooli application are:

* Put the same files in a directory called `hooli`.
* Change `index.js` constants to use the Hooli values for the title (to 'Hooli'), hostname (`hooli.local`), port (`3001`), and the Client Id and Client Secret (from the admin UI application screen).
* Change the layout so that the menu links to the Pied Piper application. Make sure to include the port.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/hooli/views/layout.pug"}
  lang="pug" 
  title="Index view" />

* Start the application on the port `3001`. Use a different terminal window so that you can have both Node applications running at once.

```shell script title="Starting up the Hooli application"
PORT=3001 npm start
```

And that's it. You've just created a second application. Congrats!

## Test The Results

Here's how you can test the work you've just done:

* Visit `http://piedpiper.local:3000`. You'll be redirected to the FusionAuth login screen. 
* Check <InlineUIElement>Keep Me Signed In</InlineUIElement>
* Log in.  You'll be greeted with a welcome message by the Pied Piper app.
* Click on the 'Hooli' link and you'll be automatically signed in to that application. 

Here's a demo video of the single sign-on process from the end user perspective:

<YouTube id="KxxLLoS74Ks" />

### Caveat

If you are testing these applications with a modern browser, logout won't work due to browser quirks when you are running over `http`. However, if you set up TLS and change the redirects to happen over `https`, then logout works.

## Other Scenarios

In this guide users who click on the Hooli link are automatically logged in. This is appropriate for most applications. However, if you have an application but can't customize the login process to check a session value and redirect if it doesn't exist, you can still use SSO.

Instead of redirecting the user when there's value is missing in such an application, display the FusionAuth login URL with the appropriate redirect parameter. The user will not be automatically signed in, but when they click on the login link, they will be sent to FusionAuth. FusionAuth will recognize the user as being signed in and redirect them back without requiring credentials.

### COTS applications

If you are looking to integrate with a commercial off the shelf or open source software package, FusionAuth can act as a SAML identity provider or an OIDC OpenID Provider. For example, FusionAuth can act as an IdP for Zendesk, as shown in this video:

<YouTube id="QYuTOD8wjZU" />

Please see the [SAML IdP](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/saml/) and [OIDC documentation](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/) or the single sign-on documentation for the application you're looking to integrate with for more.

## Additional Configuration

### Session Expiration

<SessionsExpiration />

### Logout Behavior

The default behavior is to log a user out of all applications when they log out of one. If you want to only log the user out of the application where the user made the logout request, you can do that.

Navigate to <Breadcrumb>Applications -> Your Application -> OAuth</Breadcrumb> and configure <InlineField>Logout behavior</InlineField> to have the value `Redirect Only`.

<img src="/img/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/application-config-logout-behavior-docs.png" alt="Configuring the logout behavior for an application." width="1200" role="top-cropped" />

## Limitations

<LogoutBehaviorAllApplications />
