<Aside type="note">
Cognito users must have a public email address configured to link on email (see [linking strategies for more on this](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/identity-providers/#linking-strategies)). An approach that will work for all users is to link on username or create an anonymous link. Using these strategies ensures that the configured Cognito OIDC connection works for every user, no matter their Cognito privacy settings.
