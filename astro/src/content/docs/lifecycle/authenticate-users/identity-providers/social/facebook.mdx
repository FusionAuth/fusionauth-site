## Overview

Adding a Login with Facebook button to FusionAuth is straightforward, and this guide will walk you through the steps necessary to collect the credentials from Facebook in order to enable this Social login.

Once you have completed this configuration you will be able to enable the Facebook login button for one or more FusionAuth Applications. Below is an example login page with the Facebook Identity Provider enabled.

## Create a Facebook Account

If you do not yet have a Facebook account, go ahead and do that first. If you need help with this step, ask your kids.

https://www.facebook.com/

## Add a Facebook Application

In order to enable the Login with Facebook option in FusionAuth we'll need to add a Facebook application. Follow the provided link or navigate to your Facebook developer account to continue.

https://developers.facebook.com/apps/

### Create a New App Id

Click on the `Create App` button to create a new Facebook application. The application `Display Name` will be shown to users when they log into FusionAuth using Facebook. Complete this form and click the `Create App` button.

### Configure Facebook Login

In order to enable Facebook login for this newly created Application, add the `Facebook Login` product to this application. The `Add a Product` is likely the first page you'll see after creating the Application, but if not find the `Products +` or `Add Product` section and find the `Facebook Login` tile and click `Set Up`.

You'll now have the `Facebook Login` product listed under the `Products` section of your application. Click on the `Settings` sub-menu of the `Facebook Login` section in the left navigation. Review this page to ensure it meets your security requirements, however the default Client OAuth Settings should be sufficient.

If you are using the redirect login method, you will want to add the absolute URL to the callback endpoint (for example, `https://login.piedpiper.com/oauth2/callback`) to the `Valid OAuth Redirect URIs` field.

If you are using the popup login method, provide an `App Domain`, `User Data Deletion` field, and `Privacy Policy URL`. When selecting a domain, add the top level domain of your application in the `App Domains` field (for example, in our app we added `piedpiper.com` because our application login will originate from `https://login.piedpiper.com`).

### Collect App ID and App Secret

To complete the configuration you will need to collect the `App ID` and the `App Secret` to use in the FusionAuth configuration. To find these values, navigate to <strong>Settings -> Basic</strong> in the left navigation.

You can either record these values now, or keep this page open so you can copy and paste these values during the next step in FusionAuth.

Note the mode of your application begins as `development`. To make this application public or `live` you will need to toggle the `App Mode` button. If toggled to `live` you will be prompted by Facebook to complete a few other settings. However, you may still use this application to login while in this non-public state.

## Create a Facebook Identity Provider

The last step will be to create a Facebook Identity Provider in FusionAuth. To create an Identity Provider navigate to <strong>Settings -> Identity Providers</strong> and click `Add provider` and select `Facebook` from the dialog.

This will take you to the `Add Facebook` panel, and you'll fill out the `App Id` and `App Secret` required fields using the values from the Facebook console. The button text is also required but it will be defaulted to `Login with Facebook`, you may optionally modify this default value.

### Form Fields

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="App Id" required>
    The Facebook App ID found in your Facebook application settings in the `App ID` field.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="App secret" required>
    The Facebook App Secret found in your Facebook application settings in the `App Secret` field.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Button text" required>
    The text to be displayed in the button on the login form. This value is defaulted to `Login with Facebook` but it may be modified to your preference.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Fields" optional defaults="email">
    This optional field defines the fields you're requesting from the user during login. See the [Facebook Graph API documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/using-graph-api/) for further information.

    If this field is omitted it will default to `email`. This field is the minimum required to complete login. This field will not be modified on an update if the field is left blank during an edit.

    You may want to request additional fields such as name and birthday. Here is an example to request multiple fields: `email,name,first_name,last_name,birthday`
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Login Method" optional>
    User interaction behavior after clicking on the IdP button (`Login with Facebook`, for instance).

     * `Use redirect for login` - if selected, the user is redirected to a Facebook login page. Once authenticated, the user is redirected back to FusionAuth.
    If selected, the redirect URL *must* be set to an absolute URL in the Facebook console for your application. If your hostname is login.piedpiper.com, the redirect URL would be `https://login.piedpiper.com/oauth2/callback/`.
     * `Use popup for login` - if selected, a popup is displayed to the user to login with Facebook. Once authenticated, the window is closed.
    If using `Use Popup for login`, you will need to fill in `App Domain`, `User Data Deletion`, and `Privacy Policy URL` fields in your Facebook App settings.  Additionally, you need to enable `Login with the JavaScript SDK`.
     * `Use vendor JavaScript` - if selected, behavior will match `Use popup for login`

    Please note if an `idp_hint` is appended to the OAuth Authorize endpoint, then the login method interaction will be `redirect`, even if popup interaction is explicitly configured.

  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Permissions" optional defaults="email">
    This optional field defines the permissions you're requesting from the user during login. See the [Facebook Login API documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/) for further information.
