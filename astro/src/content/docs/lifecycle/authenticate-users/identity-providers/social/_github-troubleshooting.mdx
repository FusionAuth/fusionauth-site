GitHub users must have a public email address to allow FusionAuth to link their account on an email address. If they do not, you will get an error message stating `An email address was not provided for the user. This account cannot be used to login, unable to complete this login request.`  You have two options:

* Require all users who use GitHub to log in have a public email address. This is configured on a per-user basis under <Breadcrumb>Public Profile -> Public Email</Breadcrumb>. This is done **on GitHub**.
* Link on [username or create an anonymous link](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/identity-providers/#linking-strategies). Using these strategies ensure the configured GitHub OIDC connection works for every user, no matter their GitHub privacy settings, but means you won't have access to their email address.
