## Configure OpenID Connect with Discord

Once you have completed this configuration you may enable an OpenID Connect "Login with Discord" button for one or more FusionAuth Applications. See [Discord - OAuth2](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2/) for an additional reference.

### Register a Discord OAuth2 Application

You will first need to log in to [Discord](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).

Once logged in, navigate to [https://discord.com/developers/applications/](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) and create a new application.

Once the application has been created, note the `CLIENT ID` and the `CLIENT SECRET`.  These will be used respectively as the <InlineField>Client Id</InlineField> value and the <InlineField>Client secret</InlineField> value in your FusionAuth OpenID Connect Identity Provider configuration.

Now navigate to <strong>Selected App -> Settings -> OAuth2</strong> in the navigation pane on the left side of the screen to configure OAuth2 for your Discord app.

Here we have configured a `REDIRECT` for our application.  If FusionAuth is running at `https://login.piedpiper.com`, this value should be `https://login.piedpiper.com/oauth2/callback`.

### Configure a New FusionAuth OpenID Connect Identity Provider

To create a Discord Identity Provider return to FusionAuth and  navigate to <strong>Settings -> Identity Providers</strong> and click `Add OpenID Connect`.

This will take you to the `Add OpenID Connect` screen, and you'll fill out the required fields. <InlineField>Client Id</InlineField> and <InlineField>Client secret</InlineField> values reference the previously noted Discord Application's `CLIENT ID` and `CLIENT SECRET`. The <InlineField>Redirect URL</InlineField> is read only and generated for you based upon the URL of FusionAuth. This value should match the one you configured in your Discord application.

Discord has not implemented a well-known configuration endpoint, so you will need to disable the <InlineField>Discover endpoints</InlineField> field and specify the endpoints manually.  The values for these fields are:

* `Authorization endpoint` - `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize`
* `Token endpoint` - `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/token`
* `Userinfo endpoint` - `https://discord.com/api/users/@me`

You will need to specify the scopes `identify` and `email` in the <InlineField>Scope</InlineField> field for your application.

You will need to set <InlineField>Client authentication method</InlineField> to `Request body (client_secret_post)`, as Discord expects the `client_secret` in the request body of the authentication request.

Additionally, you will need to update the <InlineField>Unique Id Claim</InlineField> field to `id` (from the standard claim of `sub`) under the <strong>Options</strong> tab.

In the following screenshot you will see that we have enabled this login provider for the `Pied Piper` application and enabled <InlineField>Create registration</InlineField>.

Discord does not implement OpenID Connect to spec. In order to pull in some additional data for populating the user profile (Discord username, Avatar URL, etc.) you can enable a <InlineField>Reconcile lambda</InlineField>.  Review [the lambda documentation](/docs/extend/code/lambdas/openid-connect-response-reconcile) to learn about how to create and assign your own lambda.  This is optional.

That's it, now the `Login with Discord` button will show up on the login page of our `PiedPiper` application.
