You may optionally scope this identity provider to one or more managed domains. For example, if you were to use an {props.type} identity provider only for your employees, add your company domain `piedpiper.com` to this field. You can add multiple domains, one on each line. 

Adding one or more managed domains for this configuration will cause this provider not to be displayed as a button on your login page. Instead of a button the login form will first ask the user for their email address. If the user's email address matches one of the configured domains the user will then be redirected to this login provider to complete authentication. If the user's email address does not match one of the configured domains, the user will be prompted for a password and they will be authenticated using FusionAuth.

These configured domains will be used by the [Lookup API](/docs/apis/identity-providers/#lookup-an-identity-provider).
