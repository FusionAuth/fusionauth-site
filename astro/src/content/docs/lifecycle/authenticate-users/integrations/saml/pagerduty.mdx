## PagerDuty + FusionAuth Integration Benefits

* Simplify the user login experience because each user only has to remember one set of credentials.
* Maintain centralized control of who has access to your Pager Duty account.
* Authorized users gain transparent access between all applications using FusionAuth as an identity provider.
* Increase security and flexibility of login credentials, including using passkeys and multi-factor authentication

## How it Works

* When a user reaches the PagerDuty login screen, they can sign in using their credentials from FusionAuth.
* User management and access is managed by FusionAuth.

## Requirements

**In PagerDuty:** you must have a [Business or Digital Operations plan](https://www.pagerduty.com/pricing/) and be the *Account Owner* in order to enable Single Sign-On. For more information about this feature, please visit their [SSO support page](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/sso). If you do not have this role, please reach out to the **Account Owner** within your organization to configure the integration.

**In FusionAuth:** you need to be able to configure a SAML connection on an application. This can be done manually with a user account assigned either the `admin` or `application_manager` role. It can also be done with an API key that has the `application` permission.

## Support

If you need help with this integration, you can request assistance in one of two ways.

* If you have a plan which includes technical support, please [open a support ticket](https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/).
* If you do not have a plan which includes technical support, [please create a forum post](/community/forum/).

You can review our [Technical Support documentation](/docs/operate/troubleshooting/technical-support) for more details.

## Integration Walkthrough

### In PagerDuty

1. The _Account Owner_ can configure the SSO settings by navigating to <Breadcrumb>User Icon -> Account Settings -> Single Sign-On</Breadcrumb>.
2. Select the **SAML** radio button.
3. Copy the **SAML Endpoint URL**.

### In FusionAuth

1. Click the <Breadcrumb>Applications</Breadcrumb> link in the sidebar.
2. Create a new Application by clicking the green <InlineUIElement>+</InlineUIElement> button in the top right corner of the page.
3. Enter a name, such as *PagerDuty*, for the app and then click on the <Breadcrumb>SAML</Breadcrumb> tab.
4. Set the <InlineField>Enabled</InlineField> field to true to turn the integration on.
5. Configure SAML functionality to integrate with your PagerDuty account.
   * Set the <InlineField>Issuer</InlineField> value to `https://YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.pagerduty.com`, where `YOUR-SUBDOMAIN` is the value of your PagerDuty subdomain.
   * Leave the <InlineField>Audience</InlineField> blank.
   * Paste the <InlineUIElement>SAML Endpoint URL</InlineUIElement> you copied from PagerDuty into the <InlineField>Authorized redirect URLs</InlineField> field. The value in this field will be blue when entered.
6. Save the application by clicking the *blue floppy disk icon* in the top right corner of the page.
7. When redirected back to the <Breadcrumb>Applications</Breadcrumb> page, view your application details by clicking the magnifier green icon.
   * In the dialog, scroll down to the <InlineUIElement>SAML v2 Integration details</InlineUIElement> section.
   * Copy the <InlineUIElement>Entity Id</InlineUIElement> URL and open it in a new browser tab. This will contain configuration you'll need shortly.
     * _Note: This address contains an XML file. If your browser doesn’t automatically format it, you can copy everything and use [an online XML beautifier](https://xmlviewer.org/)_.
     * Copy the contents of the `X509Certificate` element from the XML file and paste them in PagerDuty.
       * You should paste the contents enclosed between `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`, like the example below:


```
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<contents of X509Certificate copied from FusionAuth>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

   * Copy the <InlineUIElement>Login URL</InlineUIElement> from FusionAuth <InlineUIElement>SAML v2 Integration details</InlineUIElement> section and paste it in PagerDuty’s own <InlineField>Login URL</InlineField> field.
8. In PagerDuty, click *Save Changes* at the bottom of the screen.

### Testing

. To test the integration, open your PagerDuty application address in another browser or in private mode.
* Below the login form, click the blue <InlineUIElement>Sign In With Your Identity Provider</InlineUIElement> button to navigate to the FusionAuth login screen.
* After logging in, you should be automatically redirected to your PagerDuty application already signed in with that same account.

## How to Uninstall

In PagerDuty, the **Account Owner** can disable SSO settings by navigating to the <Breadcrumb>User Icon -> Account Settings -> Single Sign-On</Breadcrumb> and choosing the <InlineField>PagerDuty</InlineField> radio button.
