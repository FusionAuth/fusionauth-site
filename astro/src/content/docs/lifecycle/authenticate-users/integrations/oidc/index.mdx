While OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a standard and is broadly interoperable, this section contains examples of integrations where external applications delegate to FusionAuth for user authentication.

## Examples

* [CockroachDB](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/integrations/oidc/cockroachdb)
* [Salesforce](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/integrations/oidc/salesforce)

This is not the limit of supported OIDC Relying Parties (RPs). The FusionAuth community has integrated FusionAuth with many others. If you have questions about support for a specific RP, please [contact us](/contact).
