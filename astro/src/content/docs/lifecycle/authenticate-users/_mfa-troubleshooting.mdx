If using the email MFA method and your emails don't get sent, ensure you have configured your SMTP settings correctly. See the [Email Troubleshooting](/docs/operate/troubleshooting/troubleshooting#troubleshooting-email) section for more.

If using the SMS MFA method and your text messages don't get sent, ensure that you have tested the SMS messenger configuration, enabled debugging, and reviewed the event log.

If you have enabled MFA on a user but are not prompted for MFA in the login process, ensure the MFA method associated with the user is enabled on the tenant.
