Users with supported multi-factor methods can be migrated.
By using the [Users API](/docs/apis/users) and updating the <InlineField>twoFactor</InlineField> attributes of each user, you can migrate any of the supported MFA methods.
You can use this with a bulk import or a slow migration.

```json title="twoFactor object when migrating email MFA methods"
"twoFactor": {
  "methods": [{
    "method": "email",
    "email": "dinesh@aol.com"
  }, 
  {
    "method": "email",
    "email": "dinesh@gmail.com"
  }]
}
```

If your MFA method is not supported, but is message based (such as push notifications) please evaluate the [Generic Messenger](/docs/customize/email-and-messages/generic-messenger) to see if it fits your needs.
You might be able to use the SMS method with a generic messenger.

Otherwise, please open a [GitHub issue](http://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-issues/issues) detailing your use case.
