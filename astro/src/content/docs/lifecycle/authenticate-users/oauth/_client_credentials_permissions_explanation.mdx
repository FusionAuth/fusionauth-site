Permissions associated with the grant from the target entity to the recipient entity will be available in the `permissions` claim in the token. If specific permissions are requested, the recipient entity must have previously been granted all of those permissions for a successful access request. If specific permissions are requested, only the requested permissions will be in the `permissions` claim, otherwise all permissions will be available in that claim.
