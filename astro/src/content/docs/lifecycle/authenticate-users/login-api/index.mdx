## Overview

You can use the [login API](/docs/apis/login) to build your own Login experiences. This is useful when the standard hosted login pages workflow does not work for you.

Examples of why this might be the case:

* You are building a mobile application and do not want to use the system browser, however styled, to capture login information.
* You have a single-page application (SPA) and don't want to redirect your users over to FusionAuth's login pages.
* You need a login workflow that doesn't follow the standard FusionAuth workflow. For example, capturing a user's login identifier, followed by prompting them for additional profile information, then sending them a code, and finally asking for a password.
* You have a SPA and a predefined set of components, so theming won't work.
