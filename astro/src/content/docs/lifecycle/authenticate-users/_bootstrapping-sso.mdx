<Aside type="version">Available in FusionAuth 1.56.0</Aside>

In certain scenarios you may have authenticated a user outside of the typical OAuth flow. If so, you can still acquire an SSO session from FusionAuth as long as you have a valid access token for the user.

There are one-time setup steps:

* Enable the access token bootstrap setting on the tenant either via the <InlineField>Allow access token bootstrap</InlineField> setting in the [Admin UI](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/tenants#oauth) or by setting the <InlineField>tenant.ssoConfiguration.allowAccessTokenBootstrap</InlineField> field to `true` in the [Tenant API](/docs/apis/tenants).
* FusionAuth requires the access token to be in in an `Authorization` header. Because browsers do not provide a way to set the `Authorization` header when browsing to a location, you'll need to add the header using, for example, a reverse proxy.

To set up the SSO session for a given user:

* provide the access token as a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header
* redirect the user's browser to the `/oauth2/authorize` endpoint, including a `redirect_uri` parameter 

The header will need to be in the following form:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access token>
```

If the token is valid, FusionAuth will create an SSO session and redirect the browser to the provided `redirect_uri`. This `redirect_uri` parameter must be an authorized URI, registered with the given application. See the [OAuth Authorize](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/endpoints#authorize) documentation for details.
