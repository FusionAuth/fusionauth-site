## Overview

Passwordless authentication refers to any method where users do not need to provide a password to authenticate.

These methods have user interface benefits and can help decrease friction for users looking to log in. No more passwords to remember, or, worse, to forget.

## Magic Links

Instead of asking your users to remember a password, with a magic link, send an email, text message, or other communication to the user. Possession of the message proves their identity and authenticates the user.

This method works well when you: 

* know or require your users provide a communication method, such as an email address or phone number
* want to minimize login friction

## WebAuthn Passkeys

Instead of forcing users to remember a password, with WebAuthn passkeys, they can use strong biometric means of authentication. Using a standard protocol called WebAuthn, web and mobile applications can leverage devices such as phones or YubiKeys to authenticate a user.

This method works well when you:

* know your users use WebAuthn capable browsers
* want to allow for secure, phishing resistant authentication
* want to minimize login friction
