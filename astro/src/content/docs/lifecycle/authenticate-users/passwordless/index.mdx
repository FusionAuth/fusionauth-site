## Overview

Passwordless authentication refers to any method where users to not need to provide a password to authenticate.

These methods have user interface benefits and can help decrease friction for users looking to login. No more passwords to remember, or, worse, to forget.

## Magic Links

Instead of asking your users to remember a password, with a magic link, you send an email, text message, or other communication to the user. Possession of the message proves their identity and authenticates the user.

This method works well when you know your user will provide a communication mechanism, such as an email address or phone number, and you want to minimize login friction.

## WebAuthn Passkeys

Instead of forcing users to remember a password, with WebAuthn passkeys, they can use strong biometric means of authentication. Using a standard protocol called WebAuthn, web and mobile applications can leverage devices such as phones or YubiKeys to authenticate a user.

This method works well when you know your user will have access to WebAuthn capable browsers, you want to allow for secure, phishing resistant authentication, and you want to minimize login friction.
