There's a lifecycle for CIAM users: 

* Users must get into your identity store somehow. You can [migrate them to the new system](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users) if they exist elsewhere, you can create them via APIs or federation, or they must [self-register](/docs/lifecycle/register-users).
* After users are in the CIAM system, they need to [authenticate, log in or sign in](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users) (these all mean the same thing). This includes all manner of authentication methods:
  * passwordless options such as passkeys and magic links
  * Identity Providers such as Google or Facebook
  * SAML and OIDC federation
  * and more
* User profile data also needs to be [managed over time](/docs/lifecycle/manage-users). Functionality for this part of the lifecycle includes forms used by customer service reps, self-service account/profile management, searching to extract user data in bulk, and verifying users.
* Finally, users are sometimes deprovisioned. In FusionAuth this is done by locking user accounts by [deactivating or deleting users](/docs/apis/users#delete-a-user).

The documentation in this section explain FusionAuth's functionality and how it can help with each of these parts of the lifecycle.
