With a slow migration, you move users one at a time, when they log in. You keep the other system running and set up a connection between them. This means you don't have to have access to the underlying password hashes or other user information. With FusionAuth, you implement a slow migration using [Connectors](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/connectors/).

A slow migration is a good choice when you:

* don't have access to password hashes or other data from a previous auth system
* are okay running two different auth systems for a while
