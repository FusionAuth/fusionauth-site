## Overview

This is a basic example to get started configuring Azure AD as a SCIM client and establish a connection between FusionAuth and Azure AD for provisioning purposes.

For complete documentation, please refer to the [Azure AD provisioning documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/user-provisioning).

To configure the integration, in the Microsoft Azure console, navigate to *Azure AD* and click on *Enterprise Applications* and either create a new application, or select the application you will be using for SCIM provisioning. Once you have selected the application, click on *Provisioning* in the left navigation under the *Manage* section.

Here you will find an *Update Credentials* option in the *Manage Provisioning* section at the bottom of the page. Expand the *Admin Credentials* section find the required configuration fields.

<strong>Home -> Azure AD -> Enterprise Applications -> Provisioning -> Update credentials</strong>

  <APIField name="Tenant URL">

  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Secret Token">
