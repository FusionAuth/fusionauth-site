## Overview

This is a basic example to get started configuring Okta as a SCIM client and establish a connection between FusionAuth and Okta for provisioning purposes.

For complete documentation, please refer to the [Okta provisioning documentation](https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/Content/Topics/Apps/Apps_App_Integration_Wizard_SCIM.htm).

To configure the integration, in your Okta Dashboard, find your Application configured for provisioning and click on the *Provisioning* tab of the Application configuration.

Select *Integration* from the left *Settings* navigation menu, and find the required configuration fields.
