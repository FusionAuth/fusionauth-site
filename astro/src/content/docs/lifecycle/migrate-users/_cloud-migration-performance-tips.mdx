* You can't run the import API code in the same network due to security concerns. You can stand up an EC2 instance in the same AWS region to minimize network latency.
* Provide a static IP address to the FusionAuth team so they can allow list your instance. This prevents your requests from being rate limited.
* If you receive 429 error messages, you are being rate limited. Double check you are using an IP address on the allow list.
* If you receive 504 error messages, you are exhausting the resources of your deployment. Increase the size or your deployment or add in pauses.
