You can use this Connector as either a source of authentication or to migrate your users. In the former case, the {props.system_of_record} remains the system of record (where the canonical user data exists). In the latter, the user is moved over once they have authenticated successfully one time, and FusionAuth becomes the system of record.

As [documented](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/connectors/), there are a number of differences between these two choices. However, one difference is worth emphasizing. 

When you are not migrating the user and therefore using the {props.system_of_record} as the system of record, the following user attributes will reset every time the user authenticates:

* Group memberships
* Application registrations

If, for instance, you were to register such a user for an application using the FusionAuth API or the administrative user interface, the next time they authenticated, they would not be registered for that application.

Since FusionAuth is not the system of record, the {props.system_of_record} is the authoritative data source.
