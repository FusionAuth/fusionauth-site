Bulk migration lets you import users at one point in time, making for a clean cutover. You can import password hashes, including hashes performed with a custom, non-standard algorithm, making a migration seamless to your users. You use the [User Import API](/docs/apis/users#import-users) to perform this. You can also [import refresh tokens](/docs/apis/users#import-refresh-tokens), which helps if you want your users to be able to refresh access tokens transparently. When using the [User Import API](/docs/apis/users#import-users) the recommended batch size per request is dependent on deployment scale (note: 100,000 users per request is a reasonable batch size for a production capable deployment). After completing a migration you should [reindex of the Elasticsearch database](/docs/lifecycle/manage-users/search/search#reindexing-elasticsearch) as well.

A bulk migration is a good choice when you:

* want to migrate users all at once
* are migrating into a new FusionAuth instance
* have access to password hashes from a previous auth system
