## Introduction

This article explains how to import users from Stytch into FusionAuth. It is a low-level technical tutorial focussing on transferring password hashes, calling APIs, and preparing data. The article does not explain the high-level process of migration strategy. This is explained in the [migration overview article](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/bulk/general.mdx). Before proceeding, please ensure you understand concepts like dual write, backfill, final synchronization, rolling migration, and cutover. The [Stytch documentation on migration strategies](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/migrations/migrating-user-data-statically) is also useful reading. Also be aware of all laws regarding the protection and transfer of personal information in your country.

Finally, if you want to import user passwords in addition to user personal details, you need a basic understanding of how password hashing and salts work. FusionAuth has a [hashing article](/articles/security/math-of-password-hashing-algorithms-entropy) that is a good starting point.

### Limitations

This article explains how to migrate Stytch users from a Consumer Authentication project. It has not been tested with their B2B Saas Authentication project type.

This article explains how to import passwords into FusionAuth, but does not deal with other Stytch authentication types: magic links, passkeys, passcodes, mobile biometrics, and social logins such as Google OAuth.

### Prerequisites

This article is in the form of a tutorial, with data and code examples, showing you exactly how to extract and combine user credentials and information, and insert them into your FusionAuth database. To follow this tutorial, you need:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) to run the migration scripts, and npm.
- FusionAuth. The easiest way to run it locally is to use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) with the configuration file provided later in this tutorial.

Stytch also has SDKs for [Go, Java, Python, and Ruby](https://stytch.com/docs/sdks) if you prefer to convert the JavaScript scripts accompanying this tutorial to another language for your migration in production.

## Create Stytch Users

You probably already have a Stytch account with users you want to export to FusionAuth. Even so, it is a good idea to create a separate test project in Stytch with only a few users. You can use this to run an end-to-end migration between Stytch and FusionAuth quickly, without having to handle millions of real users, and the privacy risks of handling their data when encountering errors.

Create a new Stytch project:
- Create or sign in to your Stytch account at https://stytch.com/dashboard.
- In the header there is a workspace button at the top left, then a project button. Use the project button to create a new project you'll use for test users.
- Click <InlineUIElement>Configuration</InlineUIElement> â€” <InlineUIElement>API Keys</InlineUIElement> in the sidebar.
- Note the project Id and secret.

Create three example users:
- Download this tutorial's scripts repository from https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-import-scripts and unzip it, or if you have Git run the code below.
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-import-scripts.git
  ```
- In the file `fusionauth-import-scripts/stytch/js/1_makeStytchUsers.mjs`, change the project Id and secret to match your project.
- In a terminal run the code below to create three new users in Stytch using their JavaScript API.
  ```bash
  cd fusionauth-import-scripts/stytch/js
  npm update
  node 1_makeStytchUsers.mjs
  ```
- In the Stytch web dashboard, check that the users now exist.
- If any errors occur and you need to delete the users, uncomment the lines with `client.users.delete`, set the user Ids from the dashboard, and rerun the script.

<Aside type="note">
The `1_makeStytchUsers.mjs` file uses the Stytch JavaScript SDK to create users with three different hashing algorithms. However, the line `client.passwords.authenticate` provides the cleartext password to Stytch, which Stytch uses to rehash the user password using the Scrypt hashing algorithm. Thus, at the end of this script, all your users' passwords will be hashed with Scrypt in the Stytch database.

Even though you can create passwords for Stytch users with different hashing algorithms ([bcrypt, scrypt, argon2, MD-5, SHA-1, or PBKDF2](https://stytch.com/docs/api/password-migrate)), Scrypt is Stytch's preferred algorithm. Whenever a user logs in, Stytch will verify their password hash using the algorithm it is currently stored with, and then rehash their password using Scrypt and discard the old hash. Password rehashing is a common technique used to upgrade security as hashing algorithms evolve over time.

Once you have completed this tutorial and understand how to import hashes into FusionAuth, you might want to go back and comment out the `authenticate` line to test other hashing algorithms. Note that this is necessary only in the rare case that you previously imported users into Stytch from another system, and some of those users have not yet logged in again.
</Aside>

## Request User Passwords From Stytch

You cannot download your users' password hashes from Stytch using their API. To get them, email support@stytch.com from the email address you used to sign up with Stytch. Ask support to send your users' hashes to you.

### Email The Request

Stytch will encrypt the hashes with your public key. Attach this key in a `.pem` file to the email you send Stytch.

To create a private and public key pair, use the commands below in a terminal.

```shell
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem &&
openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem
```

Email Stytch only `public_key.pem`. Keep `private_key.pem` secret and secure.

An example of what these keys look like is in the directory `fusionauth-import-scripts/stytch/exampleData/1_emailRequest`. You can use the keys to request test users from Stytch, but do **not** use these keys for real users, as they are publicly available on GitHub.

<Aside type="tip">
If you don't want to bother sending Stytch an email, you can use the example response files for the rest of this tutorial. The two files Stytch emailed are in `exampleData/2_emailResponse`. Just remember to change the sample user Ids to your actual user Ids as you proceed.
</Aside>

### Decrypt The Reply

Stytch will reply with two files: an encrypted password hash file (`stytch-project-test-36510638-652a-4d3d-9a94-f0a7106582fc-hashes-2021-01-11.enc`), and the key with which to decrypt it (`key.bin.enc`).

Decrypt the password file with the commands below.

```shell
openssl pkeyutl -decrypt -inkey private_key.pem -in key.bin.enc -out key.bin &&
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in stytch-project-test-36510638-652a-4d3d-9a94-f0a7106582fc-hashes-2021-01-11.enc -out stytch_password_hashes.csv -pass file:./key.bin
```

Now you have all your user hashes in the file `stytch_password_hashes.csv`. Below is the file content for three users, in `exampleData/3_responseDecryption/stytch_password_hashes.csv`.

<RemoteCode
    url={frontmatter.importCodeRoot + "/stytch/exampleData/3_responseDecryption/stytch_password_hashes.csv"}
    lang="csv"
/>

The file header describes the parameters you need to use when running the Scrypt hashing algorithm to convert user passwords to match the hashes in this file.

Below the header are the column names, and then one row per user. In the example data, all hashes were made using Scrypt.

### Common Problems With Hashes

Not all hash algorithms use separate salts. For instance, Bcrypt will create a salt automatically when hashing a password, and store the hash and salt concatenated in one string. You may have to deal with peculiarities of different algorithms like this if you previously migrated users into Stytch from an authentication provider that did not use Scrypt.

Even when using Scrypt with the given parameters, you need to carefully check that how you hash passwords has the same result as Stytch. Hashes and salts are arrays of bytes (numbers) and therefore cannot be displayed directly as text. They are instead mapped to text using a conversion process called Base64. However, there are [different ways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#Variants_summary_table) of doing this mapping. Since you can see the hashes from Stytch use `-` and `_`, they must use RFC 4648 (the URL-safe standard). This can cause miscommunications with other hash libraries, which use `+` and `-`.

For instance, we can use this snippet of JavaScript Node.js code below in `js/2_checkHash.mjs` to create a hash for the last user in the example file above.

<RemoteCode
    url={frontmatter.importCodeRoot + "/stytch/js/2_checkHash.mjs"}
    lang="js"
/>

Note that our hash algorithm looks correct, but the hashes differ by one character, `+`, in
```
8dg6AaIWPfcLTQU7lb4H-CI49dHeqaBXfFE1ogb2qRQ=
and
8dg6AaIWPfcLTQU7lb4H+CI49dHeqaBXfFE1ogb2qRQ=
```

To have the hashes match correctly, you need to replace the `+` and `/` characters in your hash:

```js
const keyBase64 = derivedKey.toString('base64').replace(/\+/g, '-').replace(/\//g, '_');
```

JavaScript and FusionAuth use the `+` and `/` symbols. Stytch and the FusionAuth Java Stytch plugin use `-` and `_`. If you encounter an error when verifying hashes, try converting the hash and salt to use the other character set.

## Get All User Details And Combine With Hashes

Stytch emails you only the user hash and Id. You have to use the Stytch API to retrieve all user details from Stytch, then combine those with the hash from the email, and save the user to FusionAuth.

Open your hash file from Stytch in a text editor and remove all the header lines so only one user per row remains. Save this file into `stytch/js/hash.csv`. The file should look like `exampleData/4_hashFilePreparation/hash.csv` now:

<RemoteCode
    url={frontmatter.importCodeRoot + "/stytch/exampleData/4_hashFilePreparation/hash.csv"}
    lang="csv"
/>

Check the fourth column to ensure that only Scrypt users are included. The first four columns are most important: `id`, `hash`, `salt`, and `hash_method`.

The `3_getUserDetails.mjs` script loops through each user in the `hash.csv` file, uses the API to get the user details from Stytch, and saves them to `js/users.json`.

- Open `3_getUserDetails.mjs` and set your project Id and secret.
- Run the code below in a terminal in the `fusionauth-import-scripts/stytch/js` directory.
  ```bash
  npm update
  node 3_getUserDetails.mjs
  ```

Open `js/users.json`. It should look like the sample in `exampleData/5_userDetailAndHashPreparation/users.json`.

<RemoteCode
    url={frontmatter.importCodeRoot + "/stytch/exampleData/5_userDetailAndHashPreparation/user.json"}
    lang="json"
/>

Note that in Stytch a user can have multiple emails and phone numbers. FusionAuth allows for only one. You will store the extras in the user data JSON field when migrating the user, along with any other Stytch fields FusionAuth does not support.

The last lines of the object show the hash and salt that the script added from the hash file to the user details from the API.

## Install the Scrypt Password Hash Plugin For FusionAuth

The Scrypt hashing algorithm is not [natively supported by FusionAuth](/docs/reference/password-hashes). However, FusionAuth allows [custom plugins](/docs/extend/code/password-hashes/custom-password-hashing). There is a Scrypt plugin accompanying this article [in this GitHub repository](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-contrib/tree/master/Password%20Hashing%20Plugins).

Note that this repository has multiple plugin projects. You need to build and install only the hashing project.

- Download and unzip the repository, or use Git in a terminal with the code below.
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-contrib.git
  ```

Open the file `fusionauth-contrib/Password Hashing Plugins/src/main/java/com/mycompany/fusionauth/plugins/ExampleStytchScryptPasswordEncryptor.java`. It is shown below.

<RemoteCode
    url={frontmatter.javaCodeRoot + "/Password Hashing Plugins/src/main/java/com/mycompany/fusionauth/plugins/ExampleStytchScryptPasswordEncryptor.java"}
    lang="java"
/>

This program takes a password and salt and returns a hash. It accepts and returns the `+` form of Base64, but changes it to `-` to work with Java internally. The `factor` parameter is ignored. Scrypt instead has multiple parameters that are set at the top of the file. If any of these differ from the ones you received in your encrypted CSV file header, you need to change them in the Java file.

There are two other files linked to this Scrypt plugin that you shouldn't need to alter:
- `fusionauth-contrib/Password Hashing Plugins/src/main/java/com/mycompany/fusionauth/plugins/ExampleStytchScryptPasswordEncryptorTest.java`, which holds unit tests for the hasher.
- `fusionauth-contrib/Password Hashing Plugins/src/main/java/com/mycompany/fusionauth/plugins/guice/MyExampleFusionAuthPluginModule.java`, which makes the hasher file known to FusionAuth.

If you make another hash plugin you will need to make your own test and add your plugin to the guice file.

Let's build the Java plugin now and add it to FusionAuth:
- Open the file `fusionauth-contrib/Password Hashing Plugins/src/test/java/com/mycompany/fusionauth/plugins/ExampleArgon2idPasswordEncryptorTest.java` and comment out all the tests. They did not work at the time of writing this tutorial and will break your compilation.
- Open a terminal and run the code below to build a Docker container for Java, with the repository shared as a volume into the container.
  ```bash
  cd fusionauth-contrib/.devcontainer
  docker build -t javaimage .
  cd ..
  docker run -it --name javabox -v .:/workspace javaimage
  ```
- Inside the Docker container terminal that is now running, run the code below.
  ```bash
  cd "/workspace/Password Hashing Plugins"
  mvn clean install
  exit
  ```

All tests should pass and the plugin file should be available in `Password Hashing Plugins/target/fusionauth-example-password-encryptor-0.1.0.jar`.

## Deploy the plugin

You now need to copy `fusionauth-example-password-encryptor-0.1.0.jar` to your FusionAuth `plugins` directory and restart FusionAuth.

If you are not running FusionAuth already, or want to test this process in another instance, you can start FusionAuth in Docker.
- Open a new terminal in the `fusionauth-import-scripts` directory and run the code below.
  ```bash
  cd stytch/fusionAuthDockerFiles
  docker compose up
  ```
- FusionAuth will now be running and browsable at `http://localhost:9011`. You can log in with user `admin@example.com` and `password`. The container is called `fa`.
- In the `fusionauth-contrib` terminal where you built the plugin, run the code below. It will copy the JAR file into the FusionAuth container `plugins` directory.
  ```bash
  docker exec fa mkdir /usr/local/fusionauth/plugins &&
  docker cp "Password Hashing Plugins/target/fusionauth-example-password-encryptor-0.1.0.jar" fa:/usr/local/fusionauth/plugins/fusionauth-example-password-encryptor-0.1.0.jar
  ```
- Finally, you need to restart FusionAuth for it to detect the plugin. In the terminal where FusionAuth is running in Docker push `ctrl-c` to stop it, wait, and run `docker compose up` again.

## Save The User Details And Hash To FusionAuth

You now have the users file `users.json` and installed the Scrypt plugin. To import the users into FusionAuth you need to run the Node.js import script.

Open a terminal in the `fusionauth-import-scripts` directory and run the code below.
```bash
cd stytch/js
npm update
npm 4_import.js
```

This import script needs only FusionAuth to be running locally on port 9011, and the `users.json` file to exist in the same directory. The FusionAuth Kickstart file already set a sample Application (user registration) to match the Ids in `4_import.js`. If your FusionAuth installation is different, please edit the Ids in `4_import.js`.

<Aside type="tip">
You might want to set the user's registration and tenant Ids in your production migration.
```js
faUser.registrations = Array<UserRegistration>;
faUser.tenantId = UUID;
```
</Aside>

If the migration script ran successfully you should be able to log in to FusionAuth with one of the imported users:
- Browse to http://localhost:9011
- Enter username `user1@example.com` and password `averylongandunguessablepasswordwithlotsofrandominfooofisjoafasnr;,n1`
- Logging in should work, but your user will not be able to see anything as it has no administration rights.
- Log out again and login with `admin@example.com`.
- Browse to <InlineUIElement>Users</InlineUIElement> and edit one of the imported users.
- In the <InlineUIElement>Source</InlineUIElement> tab you can see all the user details.

## Debug With The FusionAuth Database

If you have errors logging in, use the FusionAuth database directly to see if your users were imported, and check their hashes manually.

You can use any Postgresql browser. [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/download) is free, cross-platform, and open source. The connection details are in `fusionauth-import-scripts/stytch/fusionAuthDockerFiles/docker-compose.yml` and `.env`.

In DBeaver or your database IDE, create a new Postgresql connection with the following details:
- URL: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:6432/fusionauth
- Host: localhost
- Port: 6432
- Database: fusionauth
- Username: fusionauth
- Password: hkaLBM3RVnyYeYeqE3WI1w2e4Avpy0Wd5O3s3

Log in to the database and browse to `Databases/fusionauth/Schemas/public/Tables/identies` and `users`. These two tables will show you the login credentials and user personal information.

## A Closer Look At The Import Script

The `4_import.mjs` script is the code you will need to spend the most time editing if you want to customize your own migration. Let's look at how it works.

It has two dependencies:
- `stream-json` â€” A JSON library that can read massive files with millions of users incrementally. It opens `users.json` for reading in the line `new Chain([fs.createReadStream(filename), parser(), new StreamArray(),])`. For more information read https://github.com/uhop/stream-json.
- `@fusionauth/typescript-client` â€” The FusionAuth SDK for Node.js. It's only used for a single operation: `fa.importUsers(importRequest);`. For more information read https://fusionauth.io/docs/sdks/typescript.

The main program loop is the code below.

```js
for await (const { value: stytchUser } of stytchUsers) {
  const faUser = getFaUserFromStytchUser(stytchUser);
  await importUser(faUser, stytchUser);
}
```

It takes a Stytch user from the JSON file, maps it to a FusionAuth (FA) user ready for import, sends it to FusionAuth.

The `getFaUserFromStytchUser()` function does a few things:
- Map as many matching fields from Stytch to FusionAuth as possible.
- FusionAuth allows only one email and phone number. Stytch has an array. The import script takes the first verified contact it can find as the primary FusionAuth contact, otherwise it just takes the first contact. Extra contacts are saved in the generic `data` JSON field.
- All Stytch user details that don't map to FusionAuth are stored in the `data` field.
- Empty fields and arrays are ignored.
- The value in `faUser.encryptionScheme = 'example-salted-stytch-scrypt';` matches the name we registered for the hashing algorithm in the Java plugin earlier.

Carefully read this function and see if you agree that the user information you need is imported correctly. If information is not needed, you can comment out the relevant lines.

The function `getNullOrUUIDFromUserId()` extracts a standard UUID from the Stytch format to set a user Id in FusionAuth.

Finally, this script imports users individually. If this is too slow when running the production migration, wrap the `importUsers()` FusionAuth SDK call in a loop that bundles users in batches of 1000.

If you are uncertain what a user attribute in FusionAuth does, read more in the [user guide](docs/apis/users), as linked in the [general migration guide](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/bulk/general) recommended earlier.

### Importing Roles

Stytch does not support user roles and applications as native properties of users. Instead, you can [implement roles](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/authorization/rbac) by adding them as values in the JSON `trusted_metadata` field of the user. This field is similar to the FusionAuth `data` field.

As discussed in the general migration guide, roles in FusionAuth are stored in a Registration object (a link between a User and an Application).

If you have roles in Stytch you want to import, add them to the `faUser.registrations` array in the import script. This is not included in the tutorial script because every Stytch client will have made their own unique way of linking users and applications in Stytch using JSON.
