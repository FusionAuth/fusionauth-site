## Introduction

Review the overview article (link). Ensure you understand password hashing and salts (link). Mentions words below:

- Setup Dual Write: Modify the application to write to both the old system and Stytch.
- Perform Backfill: Export data from the old system and import it into Stytch.
- Final Sync: After backfill, ensure all data is up-to-date on both sides. Password hashes are final step.
- Cutover: Once confident in the data integrity and operation of Stytch, you can fully cutover to using it as the sole authentication system.

Alternatively, redirect new users to FusionAuth and you don't need to do dual write.
Rolling migration:
- keep all usernames in local database
- have a flag to indicate if they are new
- more difficult if your code has provider-specific code to interact with Stytch or FusionAuth. In this case, you need to extract an interface (contract) for what the code is doing, and write a second class that fulfils the contract. Your app can then call the same functions in either class, choosing whether to use new or old based on the user flag.

## Request User Passwords From Stytch

You cannot download your users' password hashes from Stytch using their API. To get them, email support@stytch.com from the email address you used to sign up with Stytch. Ask support to send your users' hashes to you.

### Email The Request

Stytch will encrypt the hashes with your public key. Attach this key in a `.pem` file to the email you send Stytch.

To create a private and public key pair, use the commands below in a terminal.

```shell
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem &&
openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem
```

Email Stytch only `public_key.pem`. Keep `private_key.pem` secret and secure.

### Decrypt The Reply

Stytch will reply with two files: an encrypted password hash file (`something-hashes.enc`), and the key with which to decrypt it (`key.bin.enc`).

Decrypt the password file with the commands below.

```shell
openssl pkeyutl -decrypt -inkey private_key.pem -in key.bin.enc -out key.bin &&
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in something-hashes.enc -out stytch_password_hashes.csv -pass file:./key.bin
```

Now you have all your user hashes in the file `stytch_password_hashes.csv`.

Below is an example of the file content for three users.

```csv

scryptCostParameter,1 << 15,,,
scryptRParameter,8,,,

```

The file header describes the parameters you need to use when running the Scrypt hashing algorithm to convert user passwords to match the hashes in this file.

Below the header are the column names, and then one row per user.

Even though you can create passwords for Stytch users with different hashing algorithms ([bcrypt, scrypt, argon2, MD-5, SHA-1, or PBKDF2](https://stytch.com/docs/api/password-migrate)), Scrypt is Stytch's preferred algorithm. Whenever a user logs in, Stytch will verify their password hash using the algorithm it is currently stored with, and then rehash their password using Scrypt and discard the old hash. Password rehashing is a common technique used to upgrade security as hashing algorithms evolve over time.

This means that the passwords you receive in the CSV file will almost all be in Scrypt format. However, there might be some users who haven't logged in in a long time, and their password hash uses a different algorithm.

### Common Problems With Hashes

Not all hash algorithms use separate salts. For instance, Bcrypt will create a salt automatically when hashing a password, and store the hash and salt concatenated in one string. You may have to deal with peculiarities of different algorithms like this if you previously migrated users into Stytch from an authentication provider that did not use Scrypt.

Even when using Scrypt with the given parameters, you need to carefully check that how you hash passwords has the same result as Stytch.

For instance, we can use this snippet of JavaScript Node.js code below to create a hash for the last user in the example file above. (Stytch also has SDKs for [Go, Java, Python, and Ruby](https://stytch.com/docs/sdks) if you prefer to write your own scripts.)

```js
import * as crypto from 'crypto';

const password = 'averylongandunguessablepasswordwithlotsofrandominfooofisjoafasnr;,n2';
const salt = 'zKia-0BdIFKCzWbzXbj3qrhBnbiWNg==';
const hash = '8dg6AaIWPfcLTQU7lb4H-CI49dHeqaBXfFE1ogb2qRQ=';

const cost = 1 << 15;
const blockSize = 8;
const parallelization = 1;
const keyLength = 32;

crypto.scrypt(password, salt, keyLength, { N: cost, r: blockSize, p: parallelization, maxmem: 1024 * 1024 * 1024*50 }, (err, derivedKey) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  const keyBase64 = derivedKey.toString('base64');
  console.log('Hash:', keyBase64); // 8dg6AaIWPfcLTQU7lb4H+CI49dHeqaBXfFE1ogb2qRQ=
  console.log('Matches provided hash:', keyBase64 === hash);
});
```

Note that our hash algorithm looks correct, but the hashes differ by one character, `+`, in `8dg6AaIWPfcLTQU7lb4H-CI49dHeqaBXfFE1ogb2qRQ=` and `8dg6AaIWPfcLTQU7lb4H+CI49dHeqaBXfFE1ogb2qRQ=`.

This is because Stych uses alternative characters in Base64 encoding to make them safe in URLs. To have the hashes match correctly, you need to replace the `+` and `/` characters in your hash:

```js
const keyBase64 = derivedKey.toString('base64').replace(/\+/g, '-').replace(/\//g, '_');
```

### Create Your Own User Manually To Test Hashing

If you find after migration that your users cannot log in to FusionAuth, you'll need to debug why their password hashes are no longer matching. It's useful to have a known username and password to test this.

The easiest way is to create a user with the Stytch API, so that the user is included in your Stytch password export file.

Below is JavaScript code to create a user.

```js
// npm install bcryptjs stytch;

import * as stytch from "stytch";
import * as bcrypt from 'bcryptjs';

const client = new stytch.Client({
  project_id: "project-test-36510638-652a-4d3d-9a94-f0a7106582fc",
  secret: "secret-test-something=",
});

await createUser({ email: "user4@example.com", phone_number: '+272223331444',  first_name: 'A', last_name: 'Example', password: "averylongandunguessablepasswordwithlotsofrandominfooofisjoafasnr;,n1"});

async function createUser(p) {
  await client.users.create({ email: p.email, phone_number: p.phone_number,  name:{first_name: p.first_name, last_name: p.last_name}});
  const hash = await bcrypt.default.hash(p.password, 0);
  await client.passwords.migrate({
    email: p.email,
    hash: hash,
    hash_type: "bcrypt"
  });
  console.log(`Hash: ${hash}`);
  const user = await client.passwords.authenticate({ email: p.email, password: p.password });
  console.log(user);
}
```

Get your `project_id` and `secret` from the [Stytch web interface](https://stytch.com/dashboard/api-keys).

You create the user's password hash with Bcrypt in this example and save that in Stytch. But you authenticate the user afterwards (which is similar to logging in). Stytch uses the plaintext password you send in the authentication to rehash the user's password using Scrypt. Thus the hash you receive for this user in the emailed file from Stytch will also be in Scrypt, not Bcrypt.

## Example User Details From Stytch

Stytch emails you only the user hash and Id. You have to use the Stytch API to retrieve all user details from Stytch, then combine those with the hash from the email, and save the user to FusionAuth.

Below is a Node.js script to get user details from Stytch.

```js
import * as stytch from "stytch";

const client = new stytch.Client({
    project_id: "project-test-REPLACE",
    secret: "secret-test-REPLACE",
});

let u = await client.users.get({ user_id: "user-test-REPLACE" });
console.log(u);
```

The reply will look similar to the code below.

```json
{
  "biometric_registrations": [],
  "created_at": "2024-01-11T09:54:59Z",
  "crypto_wallets": [],
  "emails": [
    {
      "email": "user1@example.com",
      "email_id": "email-test-8af9b269-8f2f-44a6-8322-6f2f276cba5d",
      "verified": false
    }
  ],
  "name": {
    "first_name": "A",
    "last_name": "Example",
    "middle_name": ""
  },
  "password": {
    "password_id": "password-test-80e44428-9182-4635-8a08-9c4c5ccf6c72",
    "requires_reset": false
  },
  "phone_numbers": [
    {
      "phone_id": "phone-number-test-b4c5c640-3f30-46bc-8bdf-5379ad21367b",
      "phone_number": "+272223334444",
      "verified": false
    }
  ],
  "providers": [],
  "request_id": "request-id-test-1aee71b3-094d-4f90-a1be-086004c695fc",
  "status": "active",
  "status_code": 200,
  "totps": [],
  "trusted_metadata": {},
  "untrusted_metadata": {},
  "user_id": "user-test-178d8ee5-c458-4f48-a482-8fefa30a1a87",
  "webauthn_registrations": []
}
```

Note that in Stytch a user can have multiple emails and phone numbers. FusionAuth allows for only one. You will store the extras in the user data JSON field when migrating the user, along with any other Stytch fields FusionAuth does not support.

## A Script To Get All Users' Details And Combine With Hashes

Let's create a script that loops through every user in the Stytch hash file, gets their details from the API, then combines the details and hash into a JSON file ready for FusionAuth to import.

Firstly, open your hash file from Stytch in a text editor and remove all the header lines so only one user per row remains. The file should look like this now:

```csv
user-test-178d8ee5-c458-4f48-a482-8fefa30a1a87,uiOC_BwbKta9R9QL6Ss6KTDpCcULh9_zhObl5j4398M=,BbV-sGQqUIX1NwE6uqtSITv4fa1iMw==,scrypt,project-test-36510638-652a-4d3d-9a94-f0a7106582fc
user-test-799ea981-b2bb-417f-afe8-4ab6e79fcd2a,A6VzdsTsTHPqafORIb0GkGD6qFxdncqwA15YXRsVgvs=,XPapDAm6xdV5UhMpyPrSpy8FbfCDtA==,scrypt,project-test-36510638-652a-4d3d-9a94-f0a7106582fc
user-test-c1be12e4-fc61-4e7a-8831-0fc14cb87b65,8dg6AaIWPfcLTQU7lb4H-CI49dHeqaBXfFE1ogb2qRQ=,zKia-0BdIFKCzWbzXbj3qrhBnbiWNg==,scrypt,project-test-36510638-652a-4d3d-9a94-f0a7106582fc
```

Check the fourth column to ensure that only Scrypt users are included. In the unlikely case that you have multiple hash algorithms in Stytch, you will need to modify the export and import scripts in this tutorial.

You care only about the first three columns: Id, Hash, and Salt. If you name this file `hash.csv`, you can use the following Node.js code to create the data ready for import to FusionAuth. Put this code into a file called `export.mjs`.

```js
import * as stytch from "stytch";
import * as fs from "fs";
import csv from "csv-parser";

async function processCSV() {
  const client = new stytch.Client({
    project_id: "project-test-REPLACE",
    secret: "secret-test-REPLACE",
  });
  const table = fs.createReadStream('hash.csv')
                  .pipe(csv({ headers: false }));
  const users = [];
  for await (const row of table) {
    try {
      const user = await client.users.get({ user_id: row[0] });
      user.hash = row[1];
      user.salt = row[2];
      users.push(user);
    }
    catch (error) {
      console.error(`Error fetching user details for ID ${row[0]}: ${error.message}`);
    }
  }
  fs.writeFileSync('export.json', JSON.stringify(users, null, 2));
}

processCSV().catch(error => console.error(error));
```

Run it with the code below.

```bash
npm install csv-parser stytch
node export.mjs
```

It creates the file `export.json`.

## Save The User Details And Hash To FusionAuth

The Scrypt hashing algorithm is not [natively supported by FusionAuth](/docs/reference/password-hashes). However, the FusionAuth community can [write custom plugins](/docs/extend/code/password-hashes/custom-password-hashing). There is one available for Scrypt [here](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-contrib/tree/master/Password%20Hashing%20Plugins/src/main/java/com/mycompany/fusionauth/plugins).
