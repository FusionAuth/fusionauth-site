Migrating users with social logins such as Apple or Facebook requires that you have an existing user Id for that provider. What this unique user Id looks like depends on the particular social identity provider. The unique Id may be an email address, an integer, UUID, or a random string.

Configure the appropriate FusionAuth Identity Provider with the same values (`client_id`, etc) as the original user management system you are migrating away from.

Import users with the [Import API](/docs/apis/users#import-users), assigning each user with a social login a random password such as a UUID. 

Your next step depends on whether the social login provider's unique identifier is available as part of your migration data. If you have the social login provider's unique identifier, for each user, use the [Link API](/docs/apis/identity-providers/links) to create a link with the appropriate User Id, Identity Provider Id and Identity Provider User Id.

* The User Id is the Id of the recently created FusionAuth User.
* The Identity Provider Id is found on the corresponding [Identity Provider API documentation](/docs/apis/identity-providers/). Look for <InlineField>identityProvider.id</InlineField>.
* The Identity Provider User Id is the existing social provider user identifier exported or otherwise extracted from the original system.

You do not need to migrate the social network token, which may or may not be accessible. During the first login of a newly migrated user, FusionAuth finds the unique user in the social login provider based on the migrated Identity Provider User Id, and completes the login. During this process, FusionAuth stores a token on the Link, if the social provider returns one. Depending on the configuration of the social provider, users may see a prompt asking if they want to allow FusionAuth to have access to user data such as email address.

IdP Linking Strategies are available since version 1.28.0. Before that version, users were linked on email.

If you do not have the social login provider's identifier, you need to decide if you want to transparently link the two accounts, which is easier for the end user, or if you want to ask the user to manually link the accounts, which is more accurate, but may be confusing.

To transparently link the accounts, choose a linking strategy of `Link On Email` or `Link On Username`, which will create the user if they don't exist. However, if the user has an email address at their social provider which differs from the email address that was used to sign up for your application and which you imported to FusionAuth, then two accounts will be created. 

For example, if the user has a Google account `richard@gmail.com`, but signed up for your application with `richard@fusionauth.io`, then if you use the `Link On Email` strategy, two different accounts will be created, since FusionAuth is trying to match on email address and they don't. The same holds true for usernames with the `Link on Username` strategy.

To prompt the user to link the accounts, choose a linking strategy of `Pending`, which will prompt the end user to sign into FusionAuth after they sign into the social provider, authoritatively linking the two accounts.
