If you want to migrate Client Credentials grants, create Entities in FusionAuth corresponding to each Cognito app client that is configured to use the Client Credentials grant. The scopes within FusionAuth are currently constrained to a certain format. [Learn more about Entity Management](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/entity-management).

You can migrate each of your Cognito app clients to a FusionAuth application using the [Application API](/docs/apis/applications#create-an-application), which allows you to set your Client Id and Client Secret to be the same as they were in Cognito. Maintaining these values will minimize the impact on any applications using the OAuth Authorization Code grant or Implicit grant. Ensure you add the application to the correct tenant.
