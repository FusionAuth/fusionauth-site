## Overview

This document will help you migrate your users from Ping Identity to FusionAuth.

There are a number of different ways applications can be integrated with Ping Identity, and it would be difficult to cover them all. This guide focuses on migrating user data, including profile data and passwords. However, Ping Identity does not allow for password hash export. Therefore, you must perform a slow migration if you don’t want to force users to reset their passwords.

Alternatively, you can do a bulk migration and force everyone to reset their passwords. This option is discussed below, but the primary focus of this guide is enabling you to migrate your users from Ping Identity without requiring any password resets.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you already have FusionAuth installed. If not, please [view our installation guides](/docs/get-started/download-and-install) and install FusionAuth before you begin. For more general migration information, please view the [general migration guide](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/general-migration).

## Planning Considerations

### Slow Migration Or Bulk Migration

To preserve your users' passwords, you need to perform a slow migration. Users log in to FusionAuth with their Ping Identity credentials, and FusionAuth transparently migrates their data. Slow migrations in FusionAuth use [Connectors](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/connectors), a paid feature.

If, on the other hand, resetting user passwords is acceptable, a <ScrollRef target="Bulk Migration" /> can work for you. Review that section for more details on the required steps. You may also perform a bulk migration after a slow migration has run for a while. Active users can be transparently migrated and infrequent users may not mind resetting their password.

You can learn more about the types of migrations that FusionAuth supports [here](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/general-migration#types-of-migrations).

### Mapping User Attributes

<MappingUserAttributes migration_source_name={migration_source_name} />

### One Tenant Or Many

The [Ping Identity platform](https://docs.pingidentity.com/r/en-us/pingone/p1_c_introduction) uses an organization-based model to define tenant accounts and their related entities. The organization is the top-level identifier. It defines your entire enterprise within the platform.

FusionAuth has the concept of [Tenants](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/tenants). Both FusionAuth Tenants and Ping Identity organizations include data about users, applications, and other configuration.

Each tenant in FusionAuth is a distinct user space. You may choose to merge multiple Ping Identity organizations into one FusionAuth Tenant or keep them separate.

Learn more about [FusionAuth Tenants](/docs/extend/examples/multi-tenant).

### Identity Providers

With Ping Identity, you can use the PingOne user directory or an [external identity provider (IdP)](https://docs.pingidentity.com/r/en-us/pingone/p1_c_identityproviders). Using an external IdP allows linked users to authenticate using the credentials provided by the external IdP. An external IdP includes mapping PingOne user attributes to attributes from the IdP. With FusionAuth, these are also called [Identity Providers](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/identity-providers/).

Review the supported FusionAuth [Identity Providers](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/identity-providers/) to ensure any you need are supported. At this time, while there is considerable overlap between the supported identity providers, there are a number of differences.

If not supported explicitly, a provider may work with an OIDC or SAML connection. Otherwise, please open a [feature request](https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-issues/).

<Aside type="note">
  Importing Ping Identity users stored in an external identity provider is more straightforward because you can use the Import API; you don't have to perform a slow migration. Many of the steps in <ScrollRef target="Bulk Migration" /> will apply.
</Aside>

To retrieve the user information, use the approach documented in the <ScrollRef target="Export User Data From Ping Identity" /> section.

### Other Entities

<OtherEntitiesIntro migration_source_name={migration_source_name} other_migrated_entities="app clients or password policies" />

* Ping Identity uses [DaVinci](https://docs.pingidentity.com/r/en-us/davinci/davinci_landing_page), an orchestration platform that lets you create flows using connections and logical operators. These flows guide users through defined processes that can present customized pages, modify values, or perform other actions. In FusionAuth, [Applications](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/applications) are a similar construct, but users are associated with them through [Registrations](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/registrations).
* Ping Identity uses [Flows in DaVinci](https://docs.pingidentity.com/r/en-us/davinci/davinci_flows). A flow is a user journey, such as registration or authentication, built from a set of capabilities and logical operators. FusionAuth has a similar concept called [Lambdas](/docs/extend/code/lambdas/). FusionAuth also has [webhooks](/docs/extend/events-and-webhooks/) fired at certain points in the user lifecycle; in certain configurations, they can also stop a particular authentication flow.
* In Ping Identity a [role](https://docs.pingidentity.com/r/en-us/pingone/p1_c_roles) is a collection of permissions that can be assigned to a user, application, or connection. FusionAuth has [roles](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/roles) that are configured on an application-by-application basis and made available in a token after successful authentication.
* Ping Identity allows using [groups](https://docs.pingidentity.com/r/en-us/pingone/p1_c_groups) to organize a collection of user identities to manage access to applications. FusionAuth also has [groups](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/groups).
* Ping Identity makes use of [populations](https://docs.pingidentity.com/r/en-us/pingone/p1_c_populations). A population defines a set of users and can help you make user management simple. In FusionAuth, you can manage a set of users via a [Tenant](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/tenants).
* Ping Identity sends emails on your behalf, such as forgotten password notifications. FusionAuth also sends emails, and [the templates are customizable](/docs/customize/email-and-messages/).
* Ping Identity supports Client Credentials grant. FusionAuth offers a constrained version of this using [Entity Management](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/entity-management); this is available in all paid plans.
* Ping Identity allows for custom attributes, but they must be configured at the Directory level. In FusionAuth, as mentioned above, custom user attributes are stored on the `user.data` field and are dynamic, searchable, and unlimited in size. Any valid JSON value may be stored in this field.
* Ping Identity supports multi-factor authentication (MFA). FusionAuth also [supports MFA](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/multi-factor-authentication), which may be enabled for a tenant and configured for a user at any time.

<Aside type="note">
  In FusionAuth, users are explicitly mapped to applications with a [Registration](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/registrations).
  In Ping Identity:
  * Users get assigned to a directory in the environment as part of an organization.
  * These users then by default get access to the applications defined in this environment, but access might be dependent on certain roles.
</Aside>

#### Differences

In addition to the different names for common functionality outlined above in <ScrollRef target="Other Entities" />, there are some fundamental differences between FusionAuth and Ping Identity. If your application relies on Ping Identity-specific functionality, please review this section carefully.

* Ping Identity has certain [pricing limitations](https://www.pingidentity.com/en/company/contact-sales.html), like number of users. FusionAuth has no user limit. Instead, you are limited by the resources provided to a FusionAuth instance, such as memory, CPU, and database capacity.

Once you've planned the migration of other entities, the next step is to set up FusionAuth to connect to Ping Identity to import users during login.

### Login UI

Ping Identity allows custom [branding and theming](https://docs.pingidentity.com/r/en-us/pingone/p1_c_branding_themes) on the UI. Login pages are highly variable across Ping Identity instances. This is beyond the scope of this document.

The FusionAuth login experience follows two paths: You can choose to build your own login pages or use the FusionAuth-hosted login pages. [Read more about these choices](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/integration-points#login-options).

### Importing Users

Because you are implementing a slow migration, it will take place over time. But you can set up a test environment to confirm it will work before deploying to production. 

Here are the steps you need to take to import the user data.

1. Set up FusionAuth.
2. Set up Ping Identity to export users.
3. Configure endpoints.
4. Set up authentication logic.
5. Set up the connector.
6. Log in as a test user.
7. Verify the import.
8. Migrate everything else.

### Set Up FusionAuth

<SetUpFusionauth />

#### Create A Test Tenant

<CreateTestTenant migration_source_dir={migration_source_dir} migration_source_name={migration_source_name} add_tenant_image_role={add_tenant_image_role} />

#### Create A Test Application

<CreateTestApplication migration_source_dir={migration_source_dir} migration_source_name={migration_source_name} />

### Set Up Ping Identity To Export Users

There are two main components you need to set up to enable a slow migration from Ping Identity.

- A publicly available API endpoint that can be called from a FusionAuth Connector.
- A Ping Identity authentication "stub" to retrieve the user's details to be imported to FusionAuth.

#### Set Up An API Endpoint

You have a few options for setting up an API endpoint.

- Using Microsoft Azure, you can create an [HTTP trigger](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger?tabs=python-v2%2Cisolated-process%2Cnodejs-v4%2Cfunctionsv2) on an Azure function app.
- You can use an [API gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) on AWS.
- You can create a self-hosted endpoint locally and make it public using a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

This guide will show you how to create an ngrok endpoint that will use a Flask API to validate user credentials from FusionAuth login requests and retrieve the user's Ping Identity profile from the PingOne API.

<Aside type="note">
  ngrok can be downloaded at https://ngrok.com. There are free and paid plans available. This guide uses a free plan.
  
  Follow this [quickstart to get ngrok up and running](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/).
</Aside>

When ngrok is installed, start it with this command.

```sh
ngrok http 5001
```

Take note of the URL ngrok prints to your terminal, as you will need it later. It should look something like `https://random-ngrok-string.ngrok-free.app`.

#### Set Up A Ping Identity Stub To Authenticate Users

There are several ways you can set up a Ping Identity authentication stub.

- With Microsoft Azure, you can use a [Microsoft Azure function app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview).
- You can use an AWS [Lambda function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html).
- You can create a Flask app that exposes an endpoint used with ngrok and configured as a Connector on FusionAuth.

This guide will show you how to use Flask and ngrok.

The authentication stub accepts a login request from FusionAuth over TLS and performs an [ROPC login](https://docs.pingidentity.com/r/en-us/developer/kwc1601508084434) request on Ping Identity, returning the relevant user data via the PingOne API.

#### Add The PingOne Authorize Service To Your Environment

To connect to the Ping Identity API, add the PingOne Authorize service to your environment and then create a [worker application](https://docs.pingidentity.com/r/en-us/pingone/p1az_adding_worker_app) in the environment. To add the PingOne Authorize service to your environment, go to **Overview → Services** and click the <InlineUIElement>+</InlineUIElement> button. Click <InlineUIElement>+ Add</InlineUIElement> next to PingOne Authorize service to add the service.

<img src={`/img/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/provider-specific/${migration_source_dir}/authorise_service.png`} alt="Add PingOne Authorize service to environment." width="1200" />

#### Add A Worker Application For The PingOne Authorize Service

After setting up the PingOne Authorize service in your environment, add a worker application to enable dynamic authorization of API actions for the service. Under **Applications → Applications** click the <InlineUIElement>+</InlineUIElement> button to create a new application. Set the <InlineField>Application Name</InlineField> and select the "Worker" application type. Save the application.

<img src={`/img/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/provider-specific/${migration_source_dir}/add_worker.png`} alt="Add worker application to environment." width="1200" />

After saving, enable the application by clicking the toggle button (top right) next to the application name. Give the worker application sufficient permissions to access your user data by assigning the necessary roles, for example, the "Identity Data Admin" role for your environment.

<img src={`/img/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/provider-specific/${migration_source_dir}/add_roles.png`} alt="Add roles to worker application." width="1200" />

Generate an access token in the Configuration tab by clicking the <InlineUIElement>Get Access Token</InlineUIElement> and take note of it to use in the Flask application you will create shortly.

<img src={`/img/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/provider-specific/${migration_source_dir}/get_access_token.png`} alt="Get access token." width="1200" />

On the Overview tab of the application take note of the <InlineField>Environment ID</InlineField>.

#### Add An OIDC Application In Your Ping Environment

Create an [OIDC application](https://docs.pingidentity.com/r/en-us/pingfederate-pingone-mfa-ik/pingfederate_pingone_mfa_ik_creating_a_web_or_native_application_in_pingone) in your Ping Environment to call from the Flask app. Under **Applications → Applications** click the <InlineUIElement>+</InlineUIElement> button to create a new application. Set the <InlineField>Application Name</InlineField> and select the "OIDC Web App" application type. Save the application. After saving, enable the application by clicking the toggle button (top right) next to the application name.

On the Configuration tab click the pencil edit button to edit the configuration details of the application.

- Select "Code" as the <InlineField>Response Type</InlineField>.
- Select "Authorization Code" as the <InlineField>Grant Type</InlineField>.
- Set `https://www.google.com` for the <InlineField>Redirect URIs</InlineField>
- Take note of the Client Id of the application to use in the Flask app and save the configuration.

<img src={`/img/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/provider-specific/${migration_source_dir}/oidc_edit_config.png`} alt="OIDC application configuration" width="1200" />

<Aside type="caution">
  FusionAuth Connectors will send user credentials to Ping Identity via a Python Flask app for demonstration purposes. In production migrations, it is important to secure both the data in transit and the various endpoints that form part of the solution.

  In this guide, all communication is over TLS, and the Python Flask app can use a unique query string code for security purposes. Regardless of the migration implementation you choose, security in production migrations should be the highest priority and proper review and planning regarding this should be done.

  Ping Identity also uses an access token that needs certain administrative permissions to perform the functions needed. Please bear in mind that the access token may expire and need to be renewed.
</Aside>

### Set Up Authentication Logic

<Aside type="note">
  This section relies on Python being available on your system. Python can be downloaded from  https://www.python.org/downloads/.
</Aside>

Create a directory to set up the Flask application.

```sh
mkdir authenticator_app && cd authenticator_app
```

Set up a virtual environment in the `authenticator_app` directory by running the following command.

```sh
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment with the command.

```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install requirements for the Flask application in the virtual environment with the following command.

```sh
pip install requests flask
```

Create a `pingIdentityAuth.py` file and add the Flask authenticator code below to it. Modify the example function code provided as needed and remember to update the domains (for example, `apiPath`) to match the region where the Ping Identity data is hosted.

The following fields need to be populated from your environment:

* `envID`: The Id of the environment the user data will be exported from.
* `appId`: The Client Id of the OIDC application.
* `access_token`: The access token you generated when you created the worker application in Ping Identity.

<RemoteCode lang="python" url={codeRoot + "/pingidentity/export/slowmigration/pingIdentityAuth.py"} />

This code receives a login request from FusionAuth, attempts to log the user in via ROPC, and then returns a FusionAuth user object on success.

Following successful authentication, the function calls the [PingOne API `users` endpoint](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/main/v1/api/#getting-started-with-the-pingone-apis) to get additional user attributes, which are then transformed into a FusionAuth-compatible format.

Now run the application.

```sh
python pingIdentityAuth.py
```

#### Testing The Deployed API

The `transform_json_user` function converts the JSON returned from Ping Identity to the format FusionAuth requires.

Modify the `transform_json_user` function to match the user properties you want to import. The exact implementation depends on the custom attributes and business logic you used in Ping Identity. You could, for example, give users certain FusionAuth roles, register them for more than one application, or add them to a previously created FusionAuth group.

<Aside type="note">
  Please note that the FusionAuth connector will require a URL like the following in its configuration: `https://random-ngrok-string.ngrok-free.app/api/RopcProxy?code=s0ndU863xdbXsFO4dLZAJQXLzyTU789iaUJ43uLAtIkXm_AzFuFWP1zg==`. This is the URL exposed by ngrok and the Flask API. The code value in this example is just an arbitrary value representing the security token value you noted earlier.
</Aside>

Test the deployed API with the command below. Remember to use the credentials for your own Ping Identity test user.

```sh
curl -X POST 'https://random-ngrok-string.ngrok-free.app/api/RopcProxy?code=s0ndU863xdbXsFO4dLZAJQXLzyTU789iaUJ43uLAtIkXm_AzFuFWP1zg=='  \
  -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "loginId": "Richard",
    "password": "password"
  }'
```

If the authorization header or account credentials are incorrect, you will receive a 404 HTTP status code containing a message in the body. You can view the status code by running `curl` with the `-v` switch.

Otherwise, the following will be returned.

The `transform_json_user` function will transform the returned JSON into FusionAuth-compatible JSON, which looks something like the following.

```json title="Sample Successful Login JSON"
{
  "user": {
    "active": true,
    "birthDate": null,
    "data": {

  }
}
```

<Aside type="note">
  Once you have updated the custom function logic, it's time to configure the Connector in FusionAuth. If you are migrating from Ping Identity using the AWS or Microsoft Azure approach, you'll now deploy the Lambda function or Microsoft Azure function app.
</Aside>

### Set Up The Connector

<PremiumPlanBlurb />

Now you'll set up a Connector to use the ngrok Flask API you created. Connectors are a feature limited to paid plans of FusionAuth, so ensure you have a valid Reactor license. Learn more about [activating Reactor](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/licensing).

Log in to the FusionAuth administrative user interface.

#### Configure A Connector

Navigate to <strong>Settings -> Connectors</strong>, click the <InlineUIElement>dropdown</InlineUIElement> button, and select <InlineUIElement>Add Generic connector</InlineUIElement> button on the top right.

<img src={`/img/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/provider-specific/${migration_source_dir}/create-connector.png`} alt="Navigate to Settings, Connectors, and click Add Generic connector." width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

Configure the Connector:

* Give the Connector a name like `PingIdentityConnector`.
* Set the <InlineField>Authentication URL</InlineField> to the value of the URL endpoint created above, for example, https://random-ngrok-string.ngrok-free.app/api/RopcProxy?code=s0ndU863xdbXsFO4dLZAJQXLzyTU789iaUJ43uLAtIkXm_AzFuFWP1zg==.
* Don't set any headers, as you might need a code passed into your functions in the query string.
* Adjust the timeout values to higher values to cater for network latency when the API requests are being made.

<img src={`/img/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/provider-specific/${migration_source_dir}/configure-connector.png`} alt="Configuring a Generic Connector." width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

Save the Connector. 

Note that if you have problems with the Connector, you can enable <InlineField>Debug enabled</InlineField> to have errors or warnings logged in the FusionAuth system event log.

#### Configure The Tenant

Now you'll configure the tenant to use the Connector.

Navigate to <strong>Tenants -> Ping Identity import tenant -> Edit -> Connectors</strong>.

Click the <InlineUIElement>Add policy</InlineUIElement> button to set up a new Connector policy.

<img src={`/img/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/provider-specific/${migration_source_dir}/connector-policies.png`} alt="Connector policies for this Tenant." width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

Set the <InlineField>Connector</InlineField> field value to the name of the Connector you created. Make sure that the <InlineField>Migrate user</InlineField> field is enabled. You can leave the <InlineField>Domains</InlineField> field with the value of `*`, which will apply this Connector to every user. Submit the policy.

Ensure the new Connector Policy is at the top of the list of policies. Use the arrow buttons to move the policy if necessary. With this configuration, all users are checked against this Connector the first time they are seen. If they log in, they'll be migrated to the FusionAuth user database.

After configuration, the Connector entry form should look similar to this:

<img src={`/img/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/provider-specific/${migration_source_dir}/added-connector-policies.png`} alt="Ping Identity Connector policy added and in list" width="1200" />

Save the changes.

### Log In As A Test User

To test that users will be migrated, log in as a test user via the FusionAuth interface with a valid user from your Ping Identity instance.

You'll need the <InlineField>OAuth IdP login URL</InlineField> you recorded when you set up the test application.

<img src={`/img/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/provider-specific/${migration_source_dir}/find-login-url.png`} alt="Finding the login URL." width="1200" />

Copy this URL and open it in a new incognito browser window (if you don't use an incognito window, the admin user session will interfere with the test). You should see the login screen:

<img src={`/img/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/provider-specific/${migration_source_dir}/user-login.png`} alt="The login page." width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

Enter credentials for a Ping Identity user account; you can use the same account you used to test the API with curl and log in. The user will be transparently migrated over to FusionAuth.

If the user was not migrated or the login was unsuccessful, enable <InlineField>Debug enabled</InlineField> in the Connector configuration to troubleshoot. Navigate to <strong>Settings -> Connectors</strong> and edit the Connector.

Try to log in again with the test user, then return to the FusionAuth UI and navigate to <strong>System -> Event Log</strong> to see if it contains any useful information.

<Aside type="note">
  After a successful test login, the user will be redirected to a URL like `https://example.com/?code=2aUqU0ZhQCjtz0fnrFL_i7wxhIAh7cTfxAXEIpJE-5w&locale=en&userState=AuthenticatedNotRegistered`.

  This occurs because you haven't set up a web application to handle the authorization code redirect yet. This is an important next step, but it's beyond the scope of this document. Consult the [5-minute setup guide](/docs/quickstarts/5-minute-setup-guide) for an example of how to do this.
</Aside>

### Verify The Import

You can also check that the import succeeded by viewing the user in the administrative user interface.

<img src={`/img/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/provider-specific/${migration_source_dir}/migrated-user.png`} alt="Migrated user in FusionAuth." width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

Once you have successfully migrated a user from Ping Identity to FusionAuth, any further profile or password changes to the user will occur against the FusionAuth database.

### Clean Up Your Test Environment

When you have completed testing the migration, you can deploy the same configuration changes to production.

Depending on your architecture, you can choose to migrate users into the default tenant or a new tenant of the production instance. Whichever you choose, configure the Connector policy of the destination tenant.

If you aren't keeping users in the test tenant, delete it. This is also useful if you want to start over because you need to tweak a setting such as the default application registration. In either case, delete the test tenant you created.

Deleting a tenant will remove all the users and other configuration for the tenant, giving you a fresh start. To delete a tenant, navigate to <strong>Tenants</strong> and choose the red trash can icon corresponding to the tenant to be deleted.

<img src={`/img/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/provider-specific/${migration_source_dir}/list-of-tenants-delete-highlighted.png`} alt="Deleting a tenant." width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

Confirm that you want to delete the tenant. Depending on how many users exist in a tenant, deleting a tenant may take some time. If it is easier, you may also delete migrated users one at a time using the administrative user interface.

### Migrate Everything Else

<WhatNext />

### Estimate The Slow Migration Timeline

When using a slow migration, you can estimate how many accounts will be migrated in a given period.

<SlowMigrationTimeline />

After this period, you may want to bulk migrate the rest of the users, or treat them as inactive and not migrate them. Plan to disable the Connector and remove the tenant's Connector Policy after the slow migration is complete.

Learn more about [general slow migration considerations](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/general-migration#slow-migration-implementation).

## Bulk Migration

Be aware that the steps outlined for bulk migrating users from Ping Identity will not export password hashes and users will need to change their passwords manually on FusionAuth.

### Export User Data From Ping Identity

Ping Identity provides a [REST API](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/platform/v1/api/#get-read-user-or-users) to perform management functions.
One of these endpoints allows you to read the user information in JSON format.

We recommend exporting your user information in JSON format so that you can import the data into FusionAuth using the FusionAuth API.

### Creating The User File

To connect to the Ping Identity API and export users, create a worker application in your Ping Identity environment.  Follow the steps in the <ScrollRef target="Add The PingOne Authorize Service To Your Environment" /> and <ScrollRef target="Add A Worker Application For The PingOne Authorize Service" /> sections.

Give the worker application sufficient permissions to access your user data by assigning the necessary roles, for example, the "Identity Data Admin" role for your environment.

Generate an access token in the Configuration tab and take note of it to use in the export application.

We've created a sample Python export program to export users from a Ping Identity server to a JSON file.

The following fields need to be populated from your environment:

* `envID`: The Id of the environment the users will be exported from.
* `access_token`: The access token generated when you created the worker application in Ping Identity.

Set up a Python virtual environment as described in the <ScrollRef target="Set Up Authentication Logic" /> section. Install the `requests` requirement for the Python script with `pip install requests`.

Clone the code below to a file named `exportPingUsers.py` and make modifications appropriate to your environment and needs. In addition to adding the `envID` and `access_token`, change the `apiPath` to point to the domain of the region where your Ping Identity data is hosted.

<RemoteCode lang="python" url={codeRoot + "/pingidentity/export/bulk/exportPingUsers.py"} />

Run the script with the following command.

```sh
python exportPingUsers.py
```

The data received from Ping Identity will look similar to the following.

```json

    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "https://api.pingone.com/v1/environments/24f17b5b-a458-4238-973e-0f77401897ed/users?limit=100"

The script converts this data to a structure similar to the example below and saves it to a `users.json` file in the same folder as the script.

```json
{
	"users": [
		{
			"active": true,
			"birthDate": null,
			"insertInstance": null,
			"data": {
				"migrated": true,
				"favoriteColors": null
			},
			"email": "hearthfield_berengere@example.com",
			"expiry": null,
			"firstName": "",
			"fullName": "",
			"id": "916b9057-1de6-4718-931d-91f9e886316c",

			},
			"timezone": null,
			"twoFactorEnabled": false,
			"username": "wingar_hélèna",
			"verified": true
		}
	]
}
```

Check the output for any errors and to make sure the data looks correct.

If you encounter any issues, you can modify the export program to output more information about the users being exported.

### Importing Users

<Aside type="note">
  Remember that the steps outlined here for importing users will not export password hashes, and users will need to change their passwords manually in FusionAuth.
</Aside>

Here are the steps you need to take to import the user data.

1. Set up FusionAuth.
2. Get the script.
3. Install needed gems.
4. Use the script.
5. Verify the import.

### Set Up FusionAuth

<SetUpFusionauth />

#### Create A Test Tenant

<CreateTestTenant migration_source_dir={migration_source_dir} migration_source_name={migration_source_name} add_tenant_image_role={add_tenant_image_role} />

#### Create A Test Application

<CreateTestApplication migration_source_dir={migration_source_dir} migration_source_name={migration_source_name} />

#### Add An API Key

<CreateApiKeySocial migration_source_dir={migration_source_dir} />

### Get The Script

<GetScript migration_source_dir={migration_source_dir} />

### Install Needed Gems

The following gems must be available to the import script:

* `date`
* `json`
* `optparse`
* `securerandom`
* `fusionauth_client`

All of these will likely be on your system already, except the `fusionauth_client` gem.

If you have `bundler` installed, run `bundle install` in the `pingidentity` directory. Otherwise, install the needed gems another way.

### Use The Script

You can see the output of the script by running it with the `-h` option.

```sh title="Running the import script with the help command line switch"
ruby ./import.rb -h
```

The output will be similar to the following.

```sh title="The help output of the import.rb script"
Usage: import.rb [options]
    -l, --link-social-accounts       Link social accounts, if present, after import. This operation is slower than an import.
    -r APPLICATION_IDS,              A comma separated list of existing applications Ids. All users will be registered for these applications.
        --register-users
    -o, --only-link-social-accounts  Link social accounts with no import.
    -u, --users-file USERS_FILE      The exported JSON user data file from IdentityServer. Defaults to users.json.
    -f FUSIONAUTH_URL,               The location of the FusionAuth instance. Defaults to http://localhost:9011.
        --fusionauth-url
    -k, --fusionauth-api-key API_KEY The FusionAuth API key.
    -t TENANT_ID,                    The FusionAuth tenant id. Required if more than one tenant exists.
        --fusionauth-tenant-id
    -h, --help                       Prints this help.
```

For the script to work correctly, set the following switches, unless the defaults work for you.

* `-u` should point to the location of the user export file you obtained, unless the default works.
* `-f` should point to your FusionAuth instance. If you are testing locally, it will probably be `http://localhost:9011`.
* `-k` should be set to the value of the API key created above.
* `-t` should be set to the Id of the testing tenant created above.

The `-o` and `-l` switches will attempt to create links for any users authenticated via Google or another social identity provider found in the user data file.

If you are loading users with social account authentication, you must create the social identity providers in FusionAuth beforehand or the links will fail. Additionally, creating a link is not currently optimized in the same way that loading a user is. It may make sense to import all the users in one pass (omitting the `-l` switch) and then create the links using the `-o` switch in a second pass after the users are imported.

<Aside type="note">
  The social account linking functionality will only work with FusionAuth version 1.28 or above. The `fusionauth_client` library must be >= 1.28.
</Aside>

When you run the script, you should get an output similar to the following.

```sh title="Import script output"
$ ruby ./import.rb -f http://localhost:9011 -k '...' -t '...' -u users.json
FusionAuth Importer : IdentityServer
 > User file: users.json
  >> 2 users found in JSON file
 > Call FusionAuth to import users
 > Import success
Duplicate users 0
Import complete. 2 users imported.
```

#### Enhancing The Script

You may want to migrate additional data. Currently, the following attributes are migrated:

* `user_id`
* `email`
* `email_verified`
* `username`
* `insertInstance`
* `registrations`, if supplied

The migrated user will have the original Ping Identity user Id. If you have additional user attributes to migrate, review and modify the `map_user` method.

You may also want to assign roles or associate users with groups by creating the appropriate JSON data structures in the import call. These are documented in the [Import User API docs](/docs/apis/users#import-users). This will require modifying the `import.rb` code.

### Verify The Bulk Import

Log in to the FusionAuth administrative user interface and review the user entries to ensure the data was correctly imported.

<img src={`/img/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/provider-specific/${migration_source_dir}/list-users.png`} alt="List imported users." width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

### The Final Destination of Bulk Imported Users

<FinalDestination migration_source_dir={migration_source_dir} />

Now that you have all the users imported, you need to reset their passwords.

### Reset Passwords

Users may reset their password using the `Forgot Password` link on the login page, or you can use the API calls documented below to do it.

<Aside type="caution">
  This script will send an email to every imported user. Ensure your SMTP server can handle the volume. Configure your SMTP server in <strong>Tenants -> Your Tenant -> Email</strong>.
</Aside>

Review the `Change Password` template to ensure the messaging is correct. Here is [more information on modifying the template](/docs/customize/email-and-messages/templates-replacement-variables#forgot-password).

Retrieve the `loginId` from the Ping Identity JSON export files and place it in a single file. The `loginId` will either be the username or the email address. Update the script below to use the API Key created in <ScrollRef target="Set Up FusionAuth" /> step.

The script below will call the [forgot password API](/docs/apis/users#start-forgot-password-workflow) for every user. It sleeps periodically to avoid overloading the SMTP server. Make sure the API Key has the `POST` to the `api/user/forgot-password` endpoint permission enabled.

```sh title="Example User Password Reset"
#!/bin/bash
API_KEY=...
LOGIN_ID_FILE=...
FA_HOST=...

for loginId in `cat $LOGIN_ID_FILE`; do
  sleep $[( $RANDOM % 10 > 8)] # sleeps 1 second ~10% of the time
  RES=`curl --max-time 600 \
       -s -w "%{http_code}" \
       -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" \
       -H "Content-type: application/json" \
       -XPOST \
       $FA_HOST/api/user/forgot-password \
       -d '{"loginId": "'$loginId'","sendForgotPasswordEmail": true}'`
  if [ "$RES" -ne "200" ]; then
    echo "Error: $RES";
    exit 1;
  fi
done
```

At the end of this process, you have imported the user data and enabled users to reset their passwords to a known value.
