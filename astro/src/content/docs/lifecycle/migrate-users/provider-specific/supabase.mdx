## Overview

This document will help you migrate off of Supabase and onto FusionAuth.

This guide assumes you have installed FusionAuth. If you have not, please [view our installation guides](/docs/get-started/download-and-install) and install FusionAuth before you begin. For more general migration information, please view the [FusionAuth migration guide](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/general-migration).


There are a number of different ways applications can be integrated with Supabase, and it would be difficult to cover them all. This guide mentions the typical parts of a bulk migration and focuses on migrating user data from a Supabase-managed user database into FusionAuth.

## Planning Considerations

### Obtaining User Data

You can write a custom psql script in the Supabase SQL Editor to export user data as JSON that you can import to FusionAuth. In Supabase, user data is stored in the `auth.users` table, and you can join the query with data from other `auth` tables to pull specific attributes.

### Mapping User Attributes

<MappingUserAttributes />


### Social Logins

<SocialLoginNote migration_source_name={migration_source_name} />


<SocialLoginMigration />

### Other Entities

<OtherEntitiesIntro migration_source_name={migration_source_name} other_migrated_entities="connections or roles" />

* In Supabase, sign-in providers are a source of data for users. FusionAuth calls these Identity Providers.
* Projects are a high-level construct that groups entities such as users and applications together. FusionAuth calls these Tenants.
* Supabase has other products your applications might be using, like Edge functions. FusionAuth does not have equivalents for these products, and is focused only on authentication.

#### Identifiers

When creating an object with the FusionAuth API, you can specify the Id. It must be a [UUID](/docs/reference/data-types#uuids).

This works for users, applications, and tenants, among others.

Supabase uses a custom UUID format. When migrating, a new UUID will be created for the user on FusionAuth.

If you have external dependencies on an Id stored in Supabase, you can add a new attribute under `user.data` (such as `user.data.originalId`) with the value of the Supabase Id. Because everything under `user.data` is indexed and available via search, you'll be able to find your users using either the new FusionAuth Id, or the original Supabase one.

## Exporting Users

To export users from Supabase, youâ€™ll perform the following steps:

1. Access the Supabase SQL Editor and create a new query.
2. Paste the `ufn_get_user_migration_data_json()` function code into the editor.
3. Run the function in the editor and save the JSON data to a file, for example, `users.json`.

The script below is a user-defined psql function for exporting user data from Supabase. The script will generate a JSON array object.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-import-scripts/main/supabase/supabase_user_migration_script.sql"
            lang="shell"
            title="Supabase user data export function" />

The function `ufn_get_user_migration_data_json()` returns a JSON array with formatted user data. Create a new file on your machine, for example, `users.json`, and copy the generated JSON to it. You'll upload this data to FusionAuth later.

<img src={`/img/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/provider-specific/${migration_source_dir}/supabase-sql.png`} alt="Adding an API key," width="1200" />

The user data to be exported will be selected from the `auth` table. If you have other tables that contain user-specific fields (for example, usernames), you can edit the script above to cater to that.

The JSON output produced by the script should look something like this:

```json

## Importing Users

Next up, import the user data. Here are the steps you need to take.

1. Set Up FusionAuth
2. Get the Script
3. Install Needed Gems
4. Use the Script
5. Verify the Import
6. The Final Destination of Imported Users

### Set Up FusionAuth

<SetUpFusionauth />

#### Create a Test Tenant

<CreateTestTenant migration_source_dir={migration_source_dir} migration_source_name={migration_source_name} />

#### Create a Test Application

<CreateTestApplication migration_source_dir={migration_source_dir} migration_source_name={migration_source_name} />

#### Add an API Key

<CreateApiKeySocial migration_source_dir={migration_source_dir} />

### Get the Script

<GetScript migration_source_dir={migration_source_dir} />

### Install Needed Gems

The following gems must be available to the import script:

* `date`
* `json`
* `optparse`
* `securerandom`
* `fusionauth_client`

Most likely all of these will be on your system already, except the `fusionauth_client` gem.

If you have `bundler` installed, run `bundle install` in the `supabase` directory. Otherwise, install the needed gems in some other way.

### Use the Script

You can see the output of the script by running it with the `-h` option:

Running the import script with the help command line switch

```sh
ruby ./import.rb -h
```

The output will be similar to this:

```sh title="The help output of the import.rb script"
Usage: import.rb [options]
    -l, --link-social-accounts       Link social accounts, if present, after import. This operation is slower than an import.
    -r APPLICATION_IDS,              A comma separated list of existing applications Ids. All users will be registered for these applications.
        --register-users
    -o, --only-link-social-accounts  Link social accounts with no import.
    -u, --users-file USERS_FILE      The exported JSON user data file from Supabase. Defaults to users.json.
    -f FUSIONAUTH_URL,               The location of the FusionAuth instance. Defaults to http://localhost:9011.
        --fusionauth-url
    -k, --fusionauth-api-key API_KEY The FusionAuth API key.
    -t TENANT_ID,                    The FusionAuth tenant id. Required if more than one tenant exists.
        --fusionauth-tenant-id
    -m, --map-supa-id            Whether to map the Supabase id for normal imported users to the FusionAuth user id.
    -h, --help                       Prints this help.
```

For this script to work correctly, set the following switches, unless the defaults work for you:

* `-u` should point to the location of the user export file you obtained, unless the default works.
* `-f` must point to your FusionAuth instance. If you are testing locally, it will probably be `http://localhost:9011`.
* `-k` needs to be set to the value of the API key created above.
* `-t` should be set to the Id of the testing tenant created above.

The `-o` and `-l` switches will attempt to create links for any social users (where the user authenticated via Google or another social provider) found in the users data file.

If you are loading social users, you must create the social providers in FusionAuth beforehand, or the links will fail. Additionally, creating a link is not currently optimized in the same way that loading users is. So it may make sense to import all the users in one pass (omitting the `-l` switch). Then, after the users are imported, create the links using the `-o` switch in a second pass.

<Aside type="note">
The social account linking functionality will only work with FusionAuth versions above or equal to 1.28. The `fusionauth_client` library must be >= 1.28 as well.
</Aside>

When you run the script:

```shell title="Import script output"
ruby ./import.rb -f http://localhost:9011 -k '...' -u users.json -t '...' -l
```

Youâ€™ll see output like:

```shell title="Import script output"
FusionAuth Importer : Supabase
 > User file: users.json
 > Call FusionAuth to import users
 > Import success
Linking 2 social accounts
 > Link success
 > Link success
Duplicate users 0
Import complete. 4 users imported.
```

#### Enhancing the Script

You may also want to migrate additional data. Currently, the following attributes are migrated:

* `user_id`
* `email`
* `email_verified`
* `username`
* the password hash and supporting attributes, if available

If you have additional user attributes to migrate, review and modify the `map_user` method.

You may also want to assign Roles, or associate users with Groups, by creating the appropriate JSON data structures in the import call. These are documented in the
[Import User API docs](/docs/apis/users#import-users). This will require modifying the `import.rb` code.

### Verify the Import

<VerifyImport migration_source_dir={migration_source_dir} />

### The Final Destination of Imported Users

<FinalDestination migration_source_dir={migration_source_dir} />
