If your application uses a different password hashing algorithm than {props.hashing_algorithm}, you'll need to identify the encryption scheme and properly separate the hash components according to FusionAuth's requirements. When exporting password data, you must provide:

- `encryptionScheme`: The hashing algorithm used.
- `password`: The hashed password portion.
- `salt`: The salt value, if applicable to the scheme.
- `factor`: The cost factor or iteration count.

Review the [supported password hashing schemes](/docs/reference/password-hashes) to see available options and the [Import Users API documentation](/docs/apis/users#password-hashes) for implementation details, or consider creating a [custom password encryptor](/docs/extend/code/password-hashes/custom-password-hashing) if your scheme isn't supported.
