There are often other important entities, such as {props.other_migrated_entities}, that need to be migrated. There are usually fewer of these, so an automated migration may not make sense, but plan to move this configuration somehow.

Be aware that functionality may not be the same between {props.migration_source_name} and FusionAuth. This is different from user data; as long as you can somehow migrate a login identifier (a username or email) and a password hash, a user will be authenticated and successfully migrated. You can [download FusionAuth](/download/) before you begin a migration and build a proof of concept to learn more about the differences. 

A partial list of what may need to be migrated for your application to work properly includes the following:
