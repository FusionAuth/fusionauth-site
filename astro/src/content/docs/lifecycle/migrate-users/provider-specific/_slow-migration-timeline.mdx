You can calculate a timeline by knowing the following:

* How frequently the average user logs in
* What the distribution of your users' login behavior is
* What your migration goal is

Determining these values precisely is beyond the scope of this guide. However, a good rule of thumb is to determine how often your average user logs in to your application. Then you can use this formula to find out when a certain percentage of users have migrated: `S = [(1 - (1 - P)^D)*100]%`. 

Breaking that equation down, you have:

* `P` is the probability of any single user authenticating in a given day. So if your users log in once a week on a business day, it is 0.2 (one out of five days). If they log in once a year, it is 0.0027 (one out of 365 days).
* `D` is the number of days of the migration period.
* `S` is the percentage of users who have migrated.

For `P = 0.2` and `D = 10`, `S = 89%`. Therefore, if your users log in one out of every five days, in ten days almost nine out of ten will be migrated to FusionAuth.

For `P = 0.0027` and `D = 370`, `S = 63.7%`; if your users log in once a year on average, in about a year, almost two thirds of accounts will be migrated to FusionAuth.

Using the above calculations should help you estimate the duration of a migration.
