import InlineUIElement from 'src/components/InlineUIElement.astro';

After you are done testing, you can choose to import users into the default tenant or a new tenant. Whichever you choose, make sure to update the `-t` switch to the correct value before running the import for the final time.

If you aren't keeping users in the test tenant, delete it.

If you need to start over because the import failed or you need to tweak a setting, delete the tenant you created. This will remove all the users and other configurations for this tenant, giving you a fresh start. To do so, navigate to <strong>Tenants</strong> and choose the <InlineUIElement>Delete</InlineUIElement> button (red trash can icon).

Confirm your desire to delete the tenant. Depending on how many users you have imported, this may take some time.
