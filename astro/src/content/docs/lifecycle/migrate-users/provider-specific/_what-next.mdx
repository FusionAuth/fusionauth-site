You now have your users migrated, or a plan to do so. Congratulations! What is next?

You need to migrate additional configurations, as mentioned in [Other Entities](#other-entities). Since the type of configuration varies, it is hard to provide a full list of how to import these items, but the general pattern will be:

* Identify corresponding FusionAuth functionality.
* Configure it in your FusionAuth instance, either manually or by scripting it using the [client libraries](/docs/sdks/) or [API](/docs/apis/).
* Update your application configuration to use the new FusionAuth functionality.

Make sure you assign your users to the appropriate FusionAuth applications. You can do this either:

* As part of your import process by adding registrations at import time.
* After users have been migrated with the [Registrations API](/docs/apis/registrations).

You'll also need to modify and test each of your applications, whether custom, open source, or commercial, to ensure:

* Users can successfully log in.
* The authorization code redirect is handled correctly.
* Users receive appropriate permissions and roles based on the JWT.
* The look and feel of the hosted login pages matches each application's look and feel.

If your application uses a standard OAuth, SAML or OIDC library to communicate with {props.migration_source_name}, the transition should be relatively painless.
