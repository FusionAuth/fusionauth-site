If your FusionAuth instance is hosted on a remote web server and you want to host the web service in a different location, you have several options for creating a publicly accessible API endpoint that allows the Connector to communicate with the web service.

- Using Microsoft Azure, you can create an [HTTP trigger](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger?tabs=python-v2%2Cisolated-process%2Cnodejs-v4%2Cfunctionsv2) on an Azure function app.
- You can use an [API gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) with a Lambda function on AWS.
- During testing you can create a self-hosted endpoint locally and make it accessible on the internet using a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

<Aside type="note">
  To use ngrok you can download it at https://ngrok.com. There are free and paid plans available. For testing a free plan suffice.

  Follow this [quickstart to get ngrok up and running](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/).
</Aside>

When ngrok is installed, you can start it with this command.

<Code lang="shell" code={`ngrok http ${props.ngrok_port}`}/>

Take note of the URL ngrok prints to your terminal. You can then use this URL as the <InlineField>Authentication URL</InlineField> value when setting up a Connector in FusionAuth. The URL should look something like `https://random-ngrok-string.ngrok-free.app`.
