## Overview

Oftentimes you are migrating to FusionAuth from another solution, whether it be homegrown or another vendor.

These guides and resources will help you understand and scope the migration process.

There are multiple methods you can use to migrate users into FusionAuth.

* Bulk migration
* Connectors
* SCIM
* The User API

The FusionAuth [migration guide](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/bulk/general) has general migration guidance, strategies and help.

## Bulk Migration

Bulk migration lets you import users at one point in time, making for a clean cutover. You can import password hashes, including hashes performed with a custom, non-standard algorithm, making a migration seamless to your users. You use the [User Import API](/docs/apis/users#import-users) to perform this. You can also [import refresh tokens](/docs/apis/users#import-refresh-tokens), which helps if you want your users to be able to refresh access tokens transparently.

A bulk migration is a good choice when you:

* want to migrate users all at once
* are migrating into a new FusionAuth instance
* have access to password hashes from a previous auth system

* [Supabase](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/bulk/supabase) - how to migrate from Supabase to FusionAuth
* [Tutorial](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/bulk/tutorial) - how to migrate from an example homegrown user database to FusionAuth

## Connectors

<PremiumEditionBlurb />

Connectors allow you to migrate users one by one transparently. This is called a slow or drip migration, because each user is migrated at the time of login. 

A slow migration is a good choice when you:

* are migrating from a system which doesn't allow access to password hashes
* are migrating users into a FusionAuth instance with existing users

Learn [more about slow migrations](/articles/identity-basics/slow-migration) or [how to use Connectors with FusionAuth](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/connectors).

## SCIM

<EnterpriseEditionBlurb />

[System for Cross-domain Identity Management, or SCIM](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/scim/scim) allows you to migrate and provision users from other systems such as Azure AD or Okta into FusionAuth.

SCIM is a good choice when you:

* need continuous user migration as well as user account deactivation
* have a source of user data that supports SCIM and is a SCIM client

Learn [more about SCIM](/articles/identity-basics/what-is-scim) or [how to use SCIM with FusionAuth](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/scim/scim).

## The User API

You can migrate users one by one basis using the [Create User API](/docs/apis/users). This is typically done using [a client library](/docs/sdks/). With this method, you cannot migrate the user's password.

The User API is a good choice when you:

* have a few users to migrate
* don't have passwords for users, such as when they authenticated using a social provider like Google
* are migrating users into a FusionAuth instance with existing users

## Other Useful Migration Resources

* [Plugins](/docs/extend/code/password-hashes/) - custom password hashing support, so that you can migrate without requiring your users to change their password
* [APIs](/docs/apis/) - Migrate data and configuration using the APIs
* [Client libraries](/docs/sdks/) - use the language of your choice to make FusionAuth API calls
* [Connectors](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/connectors/) - implement a gradual migration using this feature
* [Import scripts](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-import-scripts) - open source scripts to import from CSV, Auth0 and more
* [FusionAuth Plans](/pricing) - some plans include FusionAuth team support for data migration
