## Overview
The Organization Admin application is an app delivered with FusionAuth that is used for managing users within a FusionAuth tenant. The core FusionAuth application provides Tenant Manager and User Manager roles, however these roles allow for the management of _all_ tenants and users, and access cannot be restricted to a _single_ tenant. The Organization Admin app restricts access to a single tenant.

While this app can be used with any setup, the Organization Admin app is perhaps most useful in a B2B context where you have customers mapped to tenants. In this case, the app makes it easy for a customer to have one or more administrative users that can manage other user accounts within their organization, but not see users from any other tenants.

## Granting Users Access to the Organization Admin App
The Organization Admin app is an application delivered with FusionAuth, but by default it is disabled in all tenants. For a user to be able to use the Organization Admin app, you'll need to do two things:
1. Enable the application in the user's tenant
2. Register the user to the application

### Enable Organization Admin in a Tenant
The Organization Admin app is a Universal Application, which means it can be used in many tenants. To add a tenant to the Organization Admin app, find the Organization Admin app on the <Breadcrumb>Applications</Breadcrumb> page and select `Manage Universal Tenants` from its action menu.

### Register the User
Once a user's tenant is assigned to the Organization Admin app, you can register the user as you would for any application. Manage the user, and add the Organization App on the `Registrations` tab.

Note that self-service registration is not available for the Organization Admin app.

## Managing Users

### Users View
![Users View](/img/docs/lifecycle/manage-users/organization-admin/users-view.png)

The Users view shows you a list of users, limited to those from the logged-in user's tenant. The view is paginated, showing pages of 25 users, and you can use the `Previous` and `Next` buttons to navigate between pages.

Using the `Columns` button, you can select which user data columns are shown in the users list, and the app will remember your selection across sessions.

### Creating Users
From the Users view, clicking the `Create` button will take you to the New User view, where you can create a user account. 

The `Basic information` section contains a form for setting user properties.  To customize this form you'll need to go to <Breadcrumb>Customizations > Forms</Breadcrumb> in the FusionAuth Admin application and create a new `Admin Registration` form. Then to assign the new form, select your new form in the <Breadcrumb>Application > Edit > Registration > Admin Registration</Breadcrumb> setting for the Organization Admin application, which is found in the <Breadcrumb>Applications</Breadcrumb> area.

### Editing Users
From the Users view, clicking on a user takes you to the Edit User view. From here, you can edit the user's information, change their avatar, or take actions against their account.

![Users View](/img/docs/lifecycle/manage-users/organization-admin/edit-view.png)

As with creating users, the fields you see in the <Breadcrumb>Edit</Breadcrumb> view come from the `Admin Registration` form that is set on the application.

Be default, editing a user will not update their password. To update a user's password, expand the `Change password` section of the form.

#### Actions
From the <Breadcrumb>Edit</Breadcrumb> page, you can take various actions on a user.
* The <InlineUIElement>Lock user</InlineUIElement> or <InlineUIElement>Unlock user</InlineUIElement> button will lock or unlock the user being viewed. A locked user is unable to log in to any application.
* The menu next to the <InlineUIElement>Lock user</InlineUIElement> button provides additional actions
  * Change password on next login: The user will be prompted for a new password the next time they log in
  * Send password change email: This is useful for a user that has forgotten their password. An email will be sent to the email set on `user.email` or `user.data.email`, allowing the user to follow a link to a password change page. 
  * Delete user: This will irreversibly delete the user's account, and should be done with caution. Locking a user's account is often a better, non-destructive option.

## Roles and Permissions
By default, a user with access to the Organization Admin app will have read-only access. They will be able to search and view accounts, but will be unable to take any actions against user accounts.

The `admin` role grants a user full permissions in the Organization Admin app.

You can assign roles to a user by managing their registration to the Organization Admin app (see above).

| Action | Standard user | Admin user |
| -- | :--: | :--: |
| List users | Yes | Yes |
| Create user | No | Yes |
| Edit user | No | Yes |
| Delete user | No | Yes |
| Lock / unlock user | No | Yes |
| Force password change on next login| No | Yes |
| Send password change email | No | Yes |
| Delete user| No | Yes |


## Customization
At this time, the Organization Admin app is not themable. You can, however, add a custom logo by setting a logo URL in <Breadcrumb>Settings > System > UI > Logo URL</Breadcrumb>. This logo will also be used in the FusionAuth admin UI.

## Accessing the Organization Admin App
The Organization Admin app is hosted on your FusionAuth instance at `/organization-admin/TENANT_ID`. Because the Organization Admin app is a universal application, a tenant Id must be specified so that it knows which tenant to operate on.

The Organization Admin app participates in SSO, just as any other application. This means that if SSO is enabled, a user that is logged into any application in the tenant can SSO into this app (provided they are registered). This makes linking to the Organization Admin app from another application seamless to a user.
