## Overview

FusionAuth ships with two options for search: a simple search via the database search engine and the Elasticsearch database engine.

## Configuration

<Aside type="version">

As of version 1.16.0, FusionAuth ships with a database search engine as the default.

By selecting the appropriate [installation guide](/docs/get-started/download-and-install), one can easily create a configuration with Elasticsearch pre-enabled.

</Aside>

### Configuration Reference

The relevant properties which control the configuration of the search engine include `search.type` which specifies the search engine type.

For the database search engine, there is no other configuration needed.

All other settings referencing `search` apply to the Elasticsearch search engine only. Please see the [Configuration Reference](/docs/reference/configuration) for more more details.

#### Switch Engine Types

FusionAuth supports two different search engines. If you begin with one, you can change to the other if your needs change. 

This tutorial walks through how to [switch between the different search engines](/docs/lifecycle/manage-users/search/switch-search-engines).

#### Docker
If you are running FusionAuth in a Docker environment, see the [Using FusionAuth on Docker](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/docker) documentation for an example configuring Elasticsearch as the user search engine.


#### View Current Configuration

You may view the configured search engine type in the FusionAuth admin UI by navigating to <strong>System -> About</strong>.  As you can see below, this system is configured to use the database search engine.

## Using the Database Search Engine

This configuration is lightweight, simplifies installation and system complexity, but comes with the trade offs of limited search capabilities and performance implications.

The database search engine is appropriate for systems that are not dependent on the FusionAuth APIs, are not expected to have a large number of search results, or are running in an embedded environment.

If you don't need advanced searching capabilities, you may be able to use the database search engine for large installations. This is not a use case FusionAuth tests, so ensure you provision your database with enough resources and benchmark your typical use cases.

### Limitations

You may add a `*` character to wildcard match any character, including none. So `*piedpiper` will match `piedpiper` and `thepiedpiper`. You may put the wildcard at any location in a search string.

All search terms are converted to lowercase and compared with lowercase values.  In other words, all database searches are case-insensitive.

Regular expressions, ranges, and other complicated queries can not be used.

## Using the Elasticsearch Search Engine

Leveraging Elasticsearch enables advanced search capabilities on more numerous and granular data. It also provides a performance improvement.

The Elasticsearch search engine is appropriate for systems that are dependent on the FusionAuth APIs (such as [user search](/docs/apis/users#search-for-users)), are expected to have a large number of results, or require more granularity in search than is provided by the standard database search engine.

Note that you'll only be able to get back 10000 results no matter how you paginate. See the [Known Limitations](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/limitations#user-searches) section for more and some workarounds.
