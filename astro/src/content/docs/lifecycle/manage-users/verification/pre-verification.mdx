## Overview

As of version 1.62.0, FusionAuth can be configured to verify users' identities, in the registration process, before user creation.

To enable pre-verification, do the following:
* For phone: Create/configure a Messenger
* For email: Configure the Tenant Email Server
* Enable verification for the identity types(s) on the tenant
* Create an advanced registration form with the verification step
* Enable self-service registration in your app

Let's step through each of these, but first, there are some required prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

<PremiumPlanBlurb />

This tutorial assumes you are running FusionAuth version 1.62.0 or greater. If you aren't, head on over to the [installation guide](/docs/get-started/download-and-install) or the [upgrade guide](/docs/operate/deploy/upgrade) to update to a version with support for this feature.

This tutorial also assumes you have a paid plan and valid license. If you need to buy a plan, please visit the [pricing page](/pricing). If you need to activate your instance, please visit the [Reactor page](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/licensing).

### Gating vs Verification vs. Pre-Verification

<Aside type="note">
    Email Verification, pre-verification, and Application Registration Verification are not premium features, however, enforcing pre-verification with Advanced Registration Forms is. Gating stops the user from receiving a JWT or essentially completing the authentication workflow. FusionAuth is enforcing a "gate" around if a user until they verify their email/registration.
</Aside>

FusionAuth ships with registration verification and identity verification flows. These verification flows update the `verified` and `verifiedReason` attributes on a user's registration or on a user identity. You have the option to gate the user (or prevent them from "continuing" auth) based on these attributes when writing your application and integration code.

With paid FusionAuth plans, you can elect to have _FusionAuth_ "gate" your users based on these verification attributes. Gating in this sense, would prevent the user from authenticating further or obtaining a JWT and _would be enforced by the FusionAuth User Interface_. Gating happens *after* user creation.

Pre-verification applies the same concept, but user identities must be verified *before* user creation.
