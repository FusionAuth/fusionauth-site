**Question**: Will all my existing users retroactively get emails or SMS messages for either gate once enabled?

**Answer**:  No. However, if existing users have unverified identities (meaing `verified: false` with `verifiedReason: "Pending"`), and gating is enabled, then those users will be required to verify those identities at their next login.

To double-check your users' email verification status, click on <Breadcrumb>Users -> Search Bar</Breadcrumb> and use this Elasticsearch query string: `verified: false`. Note, this will return if either `user` or `user.registrations[x]` is unverified. Users found by this query will be required to verify either their email or application registration once the gate is enabled. However, **they will not be emailed until they log in**. During the login process, they will be required to click on a link to have a verification email sent to them.

  As of version 1.99.9, it's not yet possible to search for unverified phone number identities.

**Question**: What if I have accidentally/inadvertently imported users with a `verified: false` value (either on the user or application registration)?  In other words, can I do this manually.

**Answer**: Currently, there is no way to change this. However, there is an [open issue](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2897) adding this functionality. Please upvote if you believe this is needed.

**Question**: What does it mean to enable both registration and email gates and verification paths?

**Answer**: If you enable both registration verification and email verification, there will be a bit of redundancy (this is fine and expected). Consider the use case of ten applications and one common tenant. Maybe nine of those applications require only email verification, but the tenth application requires an application gate to force user opt-in behaviors.  Specifically, the user on the tenth application will get two emails to verify both their registration and their email.
