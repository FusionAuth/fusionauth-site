## Overview
The Tenant Manager application is an app delivered with FusionAuth that is used for managing users within a FusionAuth tenant. The core FusionAuth application provides Tenant Manager and User Manager roles, however these roles allow for the management of _all_ tenants and users, and access cannot be restricted to a _single_ tenant. The Tenant Manager app restricts access to a single tenant.

While this app can be used with any setup, the Tenant Manager app is perhaps most useful in a B2B context where you have customers mapped to tenants. In this case, the app makes it easy for a customer to have one or more administrative users that can manage other user accounts within their organization, but not see users from any other tenants.

## Granting Users Access to the Tenant Manager App
The Tenant Manager app is a standard application, delivered with FusionAuth. It is a Universal Application, so it is available in any tenant. To grant a user access to it, you only need to register the user to the Tenant Manager application.

Find the user in the <Breadcrumb>Users</Breadcrumb> area, select <InlineUIElement>Manage</InlineUIElement> from the <InlineUIElement>Action</InlineUIElement> menu, and add the Tenant Manager application on the `Registrations` tab.

The Tenant Manager app has one available role, `admin`. Assigning a user this role will give them full user administration privileges. If you do not assign a role in the user's registration, the user will be granted read-only access.

Note that self-service registration is not available for the Tenant Manager app.

## Managing Users

### Users View
![Users View](/img/docs/lifecycle/manage-users/tenant-manager/users-view.png)

The Users view shows you a list of users, limited to those from the logged-in user's tenant. The view is paginated, showing pages of 25 users, and you can use the various page buttons to navigate between pages.

Using the `Columns` button, you can select which user data columns are shown in the users list. This setting is persistent in your browser, and the app will remember your selection across sessions.

### Creating Users
From the Users view, clicking the `Create` button will take you to the New User view, where you can create a user account. 

The `Basic information` section contains a form for setting user properties.  To customize this form you'll need to go to <Breadcrumb>Customizations > Forms</Breadcrumb> in the FusionAuth Admin application and create a new `Admin Registration` form. Then to assign the new form, select your new form in the <Breadcrumb>Application > Edit > Registration > Admin Registration</Breadcrumb> setting for the Tenant Managerapplication, which is found in the <Breadcrumb>Applications</Breadcrumb> area.

### Editing Users
From the Users view, clicking on a user takes you to the Edit User view. From here, you can edit the user's information, change their avatar, or take actions against their account.

![Users View](/img/docs/lifecycle/manage-users/tenant-manager/edit-view.png)

As with creating users, the fields you see in the <Breadcrumb>Edit</Breadcrumb> view come from the `Admin Registration` form that is set on the application.

Note that you cannot set or change a user's password using the Tenant Manager app. If a user needs a new password, use one of the password action items described below.

#### Actions
From the <Breadcrumb>Edit</Breadcrumb> page, you can take various actions on a user.
* The <InlineUIElement>Lock user</InlineUIElement> or <InlineUIElement>Unlock user</InlineUIElement> button will lock or unlock the user being viewed. A locked user is unable to log in to any application.
* The menu next to the <InlineUIElement>Lock user</InlineUIElement> button provides additional actions
  * Change password on next login: The user will be prompted for a new password the next time they log in
  * Send password change email: This is useful for a user that has forgotten their password. An email will be sent to the email set on `user.email` or `user.data.email`, allowing the user to follow a link to a password change page. 
  * Delete user: This will irreversibly delete the user's account, and should be done with caution. Locking a user's account is often a better, non-destructive option.

## Roles and Permissions
By default, a user with access to the Tenant Manager app will have read-only access. They will be able to search and view accounts, but will be unable to take any actions against user accounts.

The `admin` role grants a user full permissions in the Tenant Manager app.

You can assign roles to a user by managing their registration to the Tenant Manager app (see above).

| Action | Standard user | Admin user |
| -- | :--: | :--: |
| List users | Yes | Yes |
| Create user | No | Yes |
| Edit user | No | Yes |
| Delete user | No | Yes |
| Lock / unlock user | No | Yes |
| Force password change on next login| No | Yes |
| Send password change email | No | Yes |
| Delete user| No | Yes |


## Customization
At this time, the Tenant Manager app is not themable. 

## Accessing the Tenant Manager App
The Tenant Manager app is hosted on your FusionAuth instance at 

`/tenant-manager/MANAGED_TENANT_ID`

Because the Tenant Manager app is a universal application, a tenant Id must be specified so that it knows which tenant to operate on.

The Tenant Manager app participates in SSO, just as any other application. This means that if SSO is enabled, a user that is logged into any application in the tenant can SSO into the Tenant Manager app and vice versa. This makes linking to the Tenant Manager app from another application, such as your own SaaS app, seamless to a user.
