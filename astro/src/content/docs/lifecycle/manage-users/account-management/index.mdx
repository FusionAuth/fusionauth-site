### A Note About User Images in this Documentation

Throughout this self service account management section we will use:

Richard Hendricks for any `user` facing actions. Imagine Richard is a user on your site, trying to enable MFA for his account, or update his profile data.

![User Profile Image Richard](/img/docs/lifecycle/manage-users/account-management/richard-hendricks-small-profile.png)

Erlich Bachman for any `admin` facing actions. Imagine Erlich is you or a customer service rep at your company.

## Finding the Self Service Page

To view the account and self service pages, login as an admin and navigate to <Breadcrumb>Applications</Breadcrumb> and click on the <Icon name="fa-search" /> icon to view the application details.

From here copy and paste the account URL into a browser. Use a different browser than the one you are using to access the FusionAuth administrative user interface, or use your browser in incognito mode.

In a real world application this link would be part of the navigation for your application.

### Account Home

Before accessing the account you will be asked to log in. Make sure the user you log in with is registered for this application.

### Update User Data and Password

FusionAuth Self Service Account Management allows users to easily update their user data and passwords.  To adjust user profile data, click on the edit icon in the upper corner.  From there a user will be presented with editable fields for user data and their password. 

More information about updating user data and passwords can be found in the [Updating User Data and Password](/docs/lifecycle/manage-users/account-management/updating-user-data) section.

### Enable or Disable MFA as a User

![Account Home](/img/docs/lifecycle/manage-users/account-management/account-management-index-crop.png)

From click on <InlineField>Manage Two Factor</InlineField>

On this screen you can add Two Factor methods.

![Account Home](/img/docs/lifecycle/manage-users/account-management/2fa-home-account-crop.png)

Current supported MFA types are:

- Authenticator
- SMS
- Email

If you are not seeing this screen, you may need additional configuration.
Please see [troubleshooting](/docs/lifecycle/manage-users/account-management/troubleshooting) steps.

You can click on the links below for more about setting up each MFA method.

- [Add Two Factor Method - Authenticator](/docs/lifecycle/manage-users/account-management/two-factor-authenticator)
- [Add Two Factor Method - Email](/docs/lifecycle/manage-users/account-management/two-factor-email)
- [Add Two Factor Method- SMS](/docs/lifecycle/manage-users/account-management/two-factor-sms)

### Recovery Codes

Please note that once an authenticator is enabled, users will be displayed recovery codes similar to what is shown below. 

Please encourage your users to save these in a secure location, as they can be used to recover an account, should one of their second factors fail to be available. For example, if an email or sms service is "down" and users still want to use your application, or if a user loses their phone, a recovery code allows access.
