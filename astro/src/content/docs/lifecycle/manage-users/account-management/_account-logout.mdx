If you have enabled the [self-service account management](/docs/lifecycle/manage-users/account-management/) functionality of FusionAuth, this has a separate session from the FusionAuth SSO session or your application session.

You must use the account logout endpoint to end this session.

To do so, redirect the user to `/account/logout?client_id=...` where the `client_id` is the application Id for which you have set up self-service account management.

This behavior is explained further in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2298).
