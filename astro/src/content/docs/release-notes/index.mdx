<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.47.1" releaseDate="July 27th, 2023" />

### Fixed
* Revert the GC (garbage collection) logging change introduced in version `1.47.0` for compatibility with the FusionAuth docker image.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2392[GitHub Issue #2392], thanks to https://github.com/pigletto[@pigletto] and https://github.com/patricknwn[@patricknwn] for reporting.


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.47.0" releaseDate="July 25th, 2023" />

<GeneralMigrationWarning warning_message="pass:normal[Please be sure to read the notes in the **Changed** section before upgrading.]" />

<DatabaseMigrationWarning warning_message="pass:normal[Please be sure to read the notes in the **Changed** section before upgrading.]" />

### Known Issues
* The garbage collection logging change introduced in version `1.47.0` was not compatible with the way the FusionAuth docker image was built. You will need to use version `1.47.1` if you will be using the FusionAuth docker image.
** Resolved in version `1.47.1` via https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2392[GitHub Issue #2392]

### Security
* A race condition exists when using a refresh token with a one-time-use policy where the same token value could successfully be used twice to obtain a new access token. In practice this would be very difficult to replicate outside of a scripted example.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1840[GitHub Issue #1840] Thanks to https://github.com/avitsrimer[@avitsrimer] for reporting the issue!
* Use a CSRF token with all federated login requests. This change will add additional protection when using a federated login to ensure the the login is completed from the same browser that started the login workflow. This mitigates an attack vector that can be used in phishing attacks where a victim could be convinced to click on a link that would cause the user to unknowingly complete a login.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2238[GitHub Issue #2238]

### Changed
* A change was made to the OAuth2 origin validation code. This change is not expected to cause any change in behavior for anyone with configured Authorized Origin URLs. The change is to inspect the port in addition to the schema and host when comparing the request and the `Referer` or `Host` header to determine if the request has originated from FusionAuth. One possible edge case that could be affected is if you using `localhost` in development for both FusionAuth and another application. In this example, it is possible that FusionAuth was not validating the Origin of requests from your application running on `localhost` correctly. If you encounter this case, you can either remove all Authorized Origin URLs from your configuration, or add the origin of your application so that it can be correctly validated.
* Due to the necessary change related to adding a CSRF token when performing a federated login, a manual change may be required to your themed login pages. Please read through these details to understand if you will be affected.
+
If you are using any 3rd party IdP configurations such as OpenID Connect, SAML v2, Google, Facebook with a custom theme, you will need to make a modification to your template in order for federated login to continue to work correctly.
+
If you are not using any 3rd party IdP configurations, or you are not using a custom theme, no change will be necessary.
+
If you will be affected by this change, please review the following details and then make the update to your theme as part of your upgrade process.
+
1. Find the `alternativeLogins` macro usage in `oauth2Authorize` and `oauth2Register` and add `federatedCSRFToken=federatedCSRFToken` as the last argument to this macro.

### Fixed
* Ensure a signed AuthN request always has the `Signature` element as the next sibling after the `Issuer` element. This bug may cause some SAML v2 services provides to reject the signature of an AuthN request sent from FusionAuth.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2348[GitHub Issue #2348]
* Upgrade our phone number validation to include the Kosovo country code of `+383`. This upgrade will add support for various other country codes as well. See linked GitHub issue for more detail.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2355[GitHub Issue #2355]
* Defend against corporate link "checkers" such as Outlook Safe Links and Google Workspace during the Change Password email workflow. This fix resolves a specific symptom that may occur when a link sent to a user during a change password workflow and the user has multi-factor authentication enabled. The symptom the end user may encounter is that multiple codes may be sent to the user during this workflow. When the two-factor method is email, multiple emails may be received, and when two-factor method is SMS, multiple SMS messages may be received. The cause of this symptom is that the link is being inspected by an intermediate party prior to the user's browser loading the link which functionally means the request is made more than once.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2360[GitHub Issue #2360]
* Improve locale validation, and restrict the number of preferred languages per user to 20. This should not have any practical impact on users of FusionAuth, but it will better protect FusionAuth from storing erroneous values for the user's preferred languages. If you have users that speak more than 20 languages, you will need to ask them to pick their top 20 favorites. 😎
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2363[GitHub Issue #2363]
* Improve username validation. This length limitation was already enforced by the schema, but the error message was not developer friendly. This change will add a proper validation error in the API response.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2368[GitHub Issue #2368]
* Update the Tenant view dialog in the admin UI to reflect the changes made to the `/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint in version `1.46.0`. This is a cosmetic change only, and does not include any functional fixes.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2333[GitHub Issue #2333]
* Fix Tenant select control on Group index page in the admin UI when only a single tenant is configured. This is just a cosmetic fix to how the form was being rendered.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2338[GitHub Issue #2338]
* Reduce Kafka logging. So noisy.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2359[GitHub Issue #2359]
* Protect the Kafka event sender from sending events related to it's own failure. This protects us from overloading the Kafka topic.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2362[GitHub Issue #2362]
* Fix the `user.registration.update.complete` event to include the updates roles if applicable.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1898[GitHub Issue #1898], thanks to https://github.com/sjswami[@sjswami] for reporting the issue!
* Better defense against a truncated `oauth_context` request parameter. This parameter is passed around during various OAuth2 workflows to maintain context. This changes allows FusionAuth to fail more gracefully if this is value is intentionally or un-intentionally modified by a 3rd party.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2382[GitHub Issue #2382]

### Enhancements
* Add `user.preferredLanguages` to the basic self-service registration to allow a user's preferred language to be collected and then utilized to send localized emails without using advanced self-service registration.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1738[GitHub Issue #1738], thanks to https://github.com/glen-84[@glen-84] and https://github.com/geoalexidis[@geoalexidis] for their input and patience while we delivered this enhancement.
* Improve handling of cache reload requests under heavy load. This should improve system performance at scale when mass creating or deleting of various items such as applications and keys.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2318[GitHub Issue #2318]
* Add timers and metrics around lambda invocations and the use of HTTP Connect within a lambda function. This should help customers tune and manage lambdas by providing additional insight into the total execution time.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2389[GitHub Issue #2389]
* Add configuration to accept any named parameter as a login hint coming from the SAML v2 SP when FusionAuth is acting as the SAML v2 IdP. Prior to this change, FusionAuth would accept `login_hint` if provided on the request. However, this value can not be configured or optionally disabled.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2222[GitHub Issue #2222]
* Add `identityProviderName` to the IdP Link API response.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2337[GitHub Issue #2337]

### New
* Support SAML v2 assertion encryption when FusionAuth is acting as the SAML v2 IdP. This means FusionAuth is now compatible with a SAML v2 SP that requires encrypted assertions.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1741[GitHub Issue #1741], thanks https://github.com/annismckenzie[@annismckenzie] for the request! This is a great addition to FusionAuth.

### Internal

** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2344[GitHub Issue #2344]
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2384[GitHub Issue #2384]
* Enable GC (garbage collection) logging. A new log named `fusionauth-app.gc.log` will be found in the log directory.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2388[GitHub Issue #2388]
* Improve performance and overhead when downloading and storing the IP location database required for resolving location meta-data for logins by IP address.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2195[GitHub Issue #2195]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.46.0" releaseDate="June 19th, 2023" />

** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2262[GitHub Issue #2262]
* Add index `entity_user_grants` to increase `SELECT` performance
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2245[GitHub Issue #2245]
* When using the `validateJWT` method in the FusionAuth Java REST Client, the `exp` or `iat` claims may have the incorrect precision.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2275[GitHub Issue #2275]
* OpenAPI spec missing some endpoints
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2247[GitHub Issue #2247]
* A change in behavior was introduced in version `1.41.0` that may cause an error when accessing FusionAuth in Docker. The change was how the `Host` header was being parsed to pick up the local port.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2250[GitHub Issue #2250], thanks to https://github.com/MarekUniq[@MarekUniq] for his report, persistence and [contribution](https://github.com/FusionAuth/java-http/pull/9) to [java-http](https://github.com/FusionAuth/java-http)!
* The `user.create.complete` and `user.registration.create.complete` events may be sent before the transaction has closed during IdP Login.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2233[GitHub Issue #2233]
* Correct the internal authentication to receive an internal webhook between FusionAuth service nodes. If you encounter this error, you may see errors in the event log that mention `&hellip;returned response code [401] when sending [JWTRefreshTokenRevoke] event&hellip;`. This error was introduced in version `1.37.0` and the error only occurs when you have more than one FusionAuth service node.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2257[GitHub Issue #2257]
* When you have enabled Implicit Email Verification, when completing a Multi-Factor login, a `user.email.verified` event may be sent even if the user has already verified their email address.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2258[GitHub Issue #2258]
* When the `user.reactivate` event is configured to be transactional and the webhook returns a non `200` status code, the transaction may not be correctly rolled back.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2281[GitHub Issue #2281]
* When making a request to the self-service pages, such as `/account/` ensure any additional query parameters are preserved through a login workflow.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2282[GitHub Issue #2282]
* When the `user.create` event is configured to be transactional, ensure the Setup Password email is not sent if a `user.create` webhook returns a non `200` status code.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2287[GitHub Issue #2287]
* When using the Device Grant with the `/oauth2/device` themed page, you may be shown a Logout button if an SSO session exists during this workflow. Clicking this button will log the user out of the SSO session and return to this page. This fixes the logout link so that you do not receive an error when returning to the `/oauth2/device` page. A workaround is documented in the linked GitHub issue.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2331[GitHub Issue #2331]

** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1729[GitHub Issue #1729]
* The OpenID Connect discovery endpoint will now accept the `tenantId` as a URL segment. This should make it easier to integrate with providers that would not otherwise allow a query parameter on this URL to specify the `tenantId`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2259[GitHub Issue #2259]
* Provide a validation error when using the `/api/jwt/reconcile` API with any IdP type `ExternalJWT`.

* Upgrade Prime MVC dependency from version `4.7.1` to `4.9.10`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2299[GitHub Issue #2299]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.45.4" releaseDate="July 25th, 2023" />

### Fixed
* Ensure we correctly handle a truncated or malformed `oauth_context` request parameter when using the hosted login pages.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2382[GitHub Issue #2382]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.45.3" releaseDate="May 31st, 2023" />

### Fixed
* Update `fusionauth/java-http` to the most recent version to pick up a bug fix.
+
This fixes a very low level HTTP server bug. In some rare cases, the HTTP response handler may not identity the end of the stream and effectively truncate the response body. It is difficult to say how how may affect your integration if you were to encounter it. If you were to make an API call with a large response body, it may be possible the response would not include a valid JSON object if the response is truncated. When this error occurs, the HTTP status code will be valid, but the response will be truncated or non-existent.
+
For additional detail see the linked commit in the linked GitHub issue.

<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.45.2" releaseDate="May 8th, 2023" />

<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

### Fixed
* If you have configured an access token signing key specific to an entity type, the signing key configuration may revert to the tenant configuration after upgrading to this version.
+
It is recommended to upgrade to this version at a minimum if you are coming from a version prior to version `1.45.0`.
+
** For more information on this issue, see the Known Issues in the `1.45.0` release notes.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2249[GitHub Issue #2249]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.45.1" releaseDate="April 14th, 2023" />

### Changed
* Add additional validation when adding authorized origin to the OAuth2 configuration to ensure the values do not include a path or query string. This change will only affect validation when adding or editing the application configuration. This change will not affect existing configured origins or their use at runtime.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2185[GitHub Issue #2185]

### Fixed
* Support for wildcard configuration when using `post_logout_redirect_uri` parameter on the OAuth2 Logout request.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2164[GitHub Issue #2164]
* Fix salt validation for the `phpass-md5` or `phpass-sha512`. This will allow the import of users with this password hash when the salt includes a `.` (period) character.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2206[GitHub Issue #2206]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.45.0" releaseDate="April 10th, 2023" />

### Known Issues
* When importing users using the `phpass-md5` or `phpass-sha512` schemes shipped in this release, if the salt contains a period (`.`) the import will fail validation.
** Resolved in version `1.45.1` via https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2206[GitHub Issue #2206]
* If you have configured an access token signing key specific to an entity type, the signing key configuration may revert to the tenant configuration after upgrading to this version.
+
If you wish to upgrade before a fix is available, please document your access token signing key configuration for each entity type that has provided a specific signing configuration. Then, once the upgrade has completed, review each entity type and confirm the correct signing key configuration. If the configuration is not correct, set the signing key to the previously documented signing key.
+
To verify if this issue may affect you during upgrade, confirm your signing configuration for each configured entity type.

** Navigate to <strong>Entity Management -> Entity Types -> Edit -> JWT</strong>.
** If you have not enabled Entity Type specific JWT signing, this section will be collapsed and this entity type will not be affected during upgrade. If the signing configuration is enabled and you have configured a key for the `Access token signing key` field, you may be affected. Please record this setting and ensure it has not changed after the upgrade has completed.
+
** If you have not yet upgraded to version `1.45.0`, it is recommended to move to version `1.45.2` or later at a minimum and skip this version if you have confirmed you may be affected by this issue.
** Resolved in `1.45.2` via https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2249[GitHub Issue #2249]

### Security
* Update usage of `verificationId` on gated email or registration verification pages when configured to use a clickable link instead of a short code.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2182[GitHub Issue #2182]
* Update 3rd party dependencies to remove CVE scan warnings. No known exploits are vulnerabilities exist in FusionAuth as the result of using these 3rd party clients. These upgrades are simply a precautionary measure to stay current.
** Upgrade Elasticsearch client from version `7.10.2` to `7.13.4`.
** Upgrade GraalJS from version `22.3.0` to `22.3.1`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2183[GitHub Issue #2183]

### Fixed
* Validate the length of an entity name in order to provide a more friendly validation error message.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2089[GitHub Issue #2089]
* Updates to the OpenAPI spec to correct an error related to `BaseSAMLv2IdentityProvider`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2103[GitHub Issue #2103]
* Review and correct tooltips in the admin UI for Application specific email templates.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2163[GitHub Issue #2163]

### Enhancements
* De-couple the self-service themed account pages from SSO. You may now use the self-service account pages even if you choose not to preserve your SSO session. For example, you can un-check the "Keep me signed in" checkbox and still use the self-service pages.
+
Also allow the self-service account session to be bootstrapped from a mobile application using token authentication, also known as the `Bearer` authentication scheme. This mechanism provides access to the self-service themed pages even if you are unable to share cookies with the web view used to complete login.
+
Example request header: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`

** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1546[GitHub Issue #1546], thanks to https://github.com/ansonallard[@ansonallard] for the suggestion!
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1860[GitHub Issue #1860]

### New
* Add a policy to require a user to provide their current password when changing a password on the self-service account pages. See <strong>Applications -> Edit -> Registration -> Form settings -> Require current password</strong>.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1578[GitHub Issue #1578]
* Integrate the Authorization Code grant workflow into FusionAuth for use with single page web applications. This feature may be used with the FusionAuth React or Angular SDKs to support the use of the Authorization Code grant without having to write any backend code.
+
And there was much rejoicing. 😅
+
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1943[GitHub Issue #1943]
* New Search APIs. These new APIs provide search and pagination capability across more APIs and may increase performance when using the FusionAuth admin UI with larger numbers of Tenants and Applications.

This migration will add an index to the `identity_provider_links` table. It is not expected to negatively impact the migration time during upgrade, but please be aware that deployments with millions of Identity Provider Links may experience additional processing time during the migration.]
<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

### Fixed
* A Lambda invocation may incorrectly fail indicating a recursive call was attempted. This is unlikely to occur, but under heavy load, it is possible.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2102[GitHub Issue #2102]
* The Application API was failing to make a copy when using `sourceApplicationId` when the source Application has enabled and configured the SAML v2 IdP. This is a bug in a new feature that was added in version `1.43.0`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2118[GitHub Issue #2118]

### Enhancements
* Add default configuration for read and connect timeouts to the SMTP server configuration. This helps protect FusionAuth against an SMTP server that never closes a socket. From time to time we observed an SMTP server hold open a socket, and tie up a send thread which may block other senders.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1742[GitHub Issue #1742]
* Change Link API request body to match the response. Backwards compatibility is maintained, but this provides a more consistent API feel.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1747[GitHub Issue #1747]
* Update the Google IdP JavaScript in the themed pages. This change removes the deprecated Google JavaScript library, and adds support for One Tap.

* Return a `404` with status only for anything under `/api/*` instead of rendering a `404` page with HTML. It just seems like the right thing to do. Nobody wants HTML in their APIs!
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2109[GitHub Issue #2109]
* Add a new index to the `identity_provider_links` table to increase performance. Better. Faster. Stronger.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2122[GitHub Issue #2122]
{/* // */}
* Add `apiMode: [Public|Partner] to allow the user to select between the public or partner Steam API. The Partner API is preferred if you have access to it because it is not rate limited.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2127[GitHub Issue #2127]
{/* // */}

### Internal
* Use `Cache-Control: no-store` more broadly in the FusionAuth admin application.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2097[GitHub Issue #2097]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.43.2" releaseDate="July 9th, 2023" />

### Changed
* The User and User Registration APIs will now restrict `user.preferredLanguages` and `registration.preferredLanguages` to a maximum of `20` values. Additionally each value can be no longer than `24` characters. This change is not expected to impact any existing integrations. Do let us know if you have a use case that is not compatible with this change.

### Fixed
* When an event fails to be sent to a Kafka topic, do not attempt to send an `event-log.create` event that results from the failed request.
+
Correct an edge case that exists where an `event-log.create` event fails to be sent to a Kafka topic, and this error causes another `event-log.create` event to be triggered.
+
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2362[GitHub Issue #2362]
* Limit the length of a valid value for `user.preferredLanguages` and `registration.preferredLanguages` to a maximum of `24` characters, and restrict the total number of values to `20` or less.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2363[GitHub Issue #2363]

### Internal
* Reduce Kafka logging to make it much less noisy at runtime
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2359[GitHub Issue #2359]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.43.1" releaseDate="March 6th, 2023" />

### Fixed
* Correct a potential FreeMarker render error caused by a missing CSRF token when performing an SAML v2 IdP initiated login to the FusionAuth admin UI. This error is a side effect of the caller not requesting the `scope=offline_access` parameter. With this fix, you should no longer encounter the error, and the `offline_access` scope is now optional on the request. A workaround is to request the `offline_access` scope.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2125[GitHub Issue #2125]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.43.0" releaseDate="February 15th, 2023" />

<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

### Known Issues
* Creating a new application from another application with `sourceApplicationId` returns a `500` error when the source application has SAML v2 enabled and configured.  If you have not configured SAML v2, you will not be affected by this issue.  Workaround is to call Create Application API without the `sourceApplicationId` parameter and supply all the parameters copied from the source application.
** Resolved in `1.44.0` via https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2118[GitHub Issue #2118].

### Fixed
* Support importing an x.509 certificate with a private key into KeyMaster in the admin UI.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1805[GitHub Issue #1805], thanks to https://github.com/konvergence[@konvergence] for reporting!

** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1809[GitHub Issue #1809], thanks to one of our MVPs https://github.com/epbensimpson[@epbensimpson] for letting us know.
* The Change Password API was incorrectly failing indicating a Trust Token was required even when provided if the user has MFA enabled.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1909[GitHub Issue #1909], thanks to https://github.com/timyourivh[@timyourivh] for the report!

** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1976[GitHub Issue #1976], thanks to https://github.com/jon-at-advarra[@jon-at-advarra], this was a great edge case.
* When taking a User Action, the duration is localized for the event. The localization is only available for a fixed number of locales. When an un-supported locale, such as Serbian is requested, an exception will occur. This has been fixed to avoid the exception, and if an un-supported Locale is requested, English will be used as the default.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1978[GitHub Issue #1978]
* When sending a test event to verify the Kafka configuration, the topic was not being validated as required.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1985[GitHub Issue #1985], thanks to https://github.com/sixhobbits[@sixhobbits], nice catch!

* Allow the SAML v2 IdP to be used for both SP and IdP initiated login. Previously to utilize SP and IdP initiated login for the same SAML v2 IdP, you would have to create two separate configurations. It is still recommended to use the separate SAML v2 IdP initiated configuration if you will not be using an SP initiated login.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1900[GitHub Issue #1900], thanks to https://github.com/leesmith110[@leesmith110] for opening the issue and providing us so much valuable feedback.

** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1942[GitHub Issue #1942]
* Allow the login hint that is passed to a 3rd Party SAML v2 IdP to be configured. Previously this was always `login_hint`, but Azure will expect `username`, this can now be configured.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1946[GitHub Issue #1946]
* Add `sourceApplicationId` to the Application API to create an app from an existing Application to copy settings. This allows you to more easily use a single Application as a template, or to just make a copy.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1957[GitHub Issue #1957]
* Ship default email templates for Add and Remove Multi-Factor methods.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1993[GitHub Issue #1993]

<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.42.1" releaseDate="January 8th, 2023" />

### Fixed
* A regression error in version `1.42.0` may cause a user to no longer be able to login after a successful login. In order to encounter this bug, you must have your tenant configured to re-hash passwords on login, and have a user login when their password encryption scheme or factor that does not match the configured tenant defaults. If you may have this type of configuration, please do not upgrade to version `1.42.0` and instead upgrade directly to this version.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2043[GitHub Issue #2043]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.42.0" releaseDate="December 7th, 2022" />

### Known Issues
* In this release, you may now create a policy to allow a user to unlock their account after too many failed login attempts by completing a forgot password workflow. A bug was identified in this new feature that may cause this workflow to fail if the user also has 2FA enabled.
** Resolved in `1.43.0` via https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2032[GitHub Issue #2032]
* An error was introduced that may, after one successful login, cause subsequent logins to fail for a user. In order to encounter this bug, you must have your tenant configured to re-hash passwords on login, and have a user login when their password encryption scheme or factor that does not match the configured tenant defaults. If you may have this type of configuration, please do not upgrade to version `1.42.0` and instead upgrade directly to version `1.42.1`.
** Resolved in `1.42.1` via https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2043[GitHub Issue #2043]

### Changed
* When building a WebAuthn credential, the user's current email address or username will now be used as the credential name. Previously this value was generated to be unique to help the user identify multiple credentials. However, Safari on macOS and Edge on Windows may display this value to the end user, so this will no longer be generated but set to a value the user should recognize.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1929[GitHub Issue #1929]
* New themed templates for enabling two-factor authentication during login. Please review your themes to ensure the new templates and localized messages are added.

* Update the `System > About` panel in the admin UI to report OpenSearch when using OpenSearch instead of Elasticsearch.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1982[GitHub Issue #1982]

### New
* Additional Multi-Factor policy option to require a user to enable multi-factor during login if not yet configured. See `Tenants > Edit > MFA > Policies > On login > Required.`. Application specific configuration can also be configured, see `Applications > Edit > MFA > Policies > On login > Required.`, using the application configuration requires an Enterprise plan.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/197[GitHub Issue #197]
* Allow refresh tokens to be revoked for a user when enabling two-factor authentication. See `Tenants > Edit > JWT > Refresh token settings > Refresh token revocation > On multi-factor enable`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1794[GitHub Issue #1794]
* A new lambda function can be assigned to perform custom validation for any step during a self-service registration. This feature is only available when using a custom form, and is not available when using basic self-service registration. This may be useful to perform advanced field validation, or to call a 3rd party API to perform additional identity verification.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1833[GitHub Issue #1833]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.41.3" releaseDate="November 21st, 2022" />

<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.41.0" releaseDate="November 10th, 2022" />

<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

### Known Issues
* A change to the FusionAuth HTTP server may cause issues with reverse proxies that default upstream connections to `HTTP/1.0`. The HTTP server we are using no longer supports `HTTP/1.0`. We have identified that `nginx` defaults all upstream connections to `HTTP/1.0`, and the HTTP server we are using no longer supports `HTTP/1.0`. For `nginx` specifically, you will need to set the proxy version by adding `proxy_http_version 1.1;` to your proxy config.

### Security
* Update `com.fasterxml.jackson.*` dependencies to version `2.14.0`. This update is proactive, there are no known exploits. See [CVE-2022-42003](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42003) and [CVE-2022-42004](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42004).
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1913[GitHub Issue #1913]

### Changed
* New themed pages added for WebAuthn. Please review your themes to ensure the new templates and localized messages are added.
** See the [Theme](/docs/apis/themes) API and the [Theme](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/overview) documentation for additional details.

* WebAuthn re-authentication requires a new hidden form field named `userVerifyingPlatformAuthenticatorAvailable` to detect compatible devices/browsers and prompt the user to register a passkey. You can view the default templates to determine in which form to insert this field into any customized templates. This field must be present on the following pages:
** OAuth authorize
** OAuth complete registration
** OAuth passwordless
** OAuth register
** OAuth two-factor
** OAuth WebAuthn (new)

** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1905[GitHub Issue #1905]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.40.1" releaseDate="September 26th, 2022" />

<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

### Fixed
* A SAML v2 IdP Initiated login request will fail if PKCE is configured as required.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1800[GitHub Issue #1800]
* The path attribute in some cookies may be set to the request path instead of `/` which may affect a SAML v2 IdP initiated login request.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1891[GitHub Issue #1891]

<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.40.0" releaseDate="September 16th, 2022" />

### Changed
* If you are using MySQL or plan to use MySQL you will need to manually download the JDBC connector to allow FusionAuth to connect to a MySQL database. If you are using PostgreSQL, this change will not affect you. See the installation guide for additional information. We apologize in advance for the inconvenience this causes you, but the Oracle GPL licensing model makes it difficult for FusionAuth to easily delivery this capability.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1862[GitHub Issue #1862]

### Fixed
* An exception may occur when you attempt to perform a `PATCH` request on a Group using a `roleId` that does not exist.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1872[GitHub Issue #1872]
* URL escape the `identityProviderUser` in the admin UI to correctly build the View and Delete actions links.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1882[GitHub Issue #1882], thanks to one of our MVPs https://github.com/epbensimpson[@epbensimpson] for letting us know and providing excellent recreation steps.

### Enhancements

** https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1884[GitHub Issue #1884]

### New
* Native Windows support has been re-instated. We apologize for the gap in native Windows support, for those who have been waiting to upgrade since version `1.37.0` you may now upgrade with a native installer. Thank you for all of you who have voiced your opinions with how we are support a native Windows installation.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1848[GitHub Issue #1848]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.39.0" releaseDate="September 11th, 2022" />

### Fixed
* When appending the `locale` request parameter on the Authorize request to pre-select the user's locale, the locale may still be incorrect for validation errors. For example, appending `locale=fr` will allow the initial render of the page to be localized in French when available. However, because the user did not manually modify the locale selector on the page, if the login fails due to a validation error, the error messages will be returned in the default locale which is generally English.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1713[GitHub Issue #1713]
* Group application roles removed during a `PATCH` request to the Group API.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1717[GitHub Issue #1717], thank you to https://github.com/paul-fink-silvacom[@paul-fink-silvacom] for raising the issue!
* Corrections to the SAML v2 SP and IdP meta data.
** The HTTP scheme was missing from the `entityID`. This issue was introduced in version `1.37.0`.
** The `NameIdFormat` found in the SP meta data was always showing `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress` regardless of the value configured in the SAML v2 IdP.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1842[GitHub Issue #1842]
* The potential exists to see an exception in the FusionAuth system logs when the internal login record service runs. It is unlikely you will experience this error unless you have very large login volumes.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1854[GitHub Issue #1854]
* There is the potential for the Elasticsearch index to become out of sync with respect to group memberships when groups are being deleted, or group members are being deleted from a group.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1855[GitHub Issue #1855]
* Add missing support for `en_GB` time and data format support in the FusionAuth admin UI when setting your preferred locale to `en_GB`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1858[GitHub Issue #1858], thanks to https://github.com/adambowen[@adambowen] for bringing this to our attention. It wasn't our intention to force our friends in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 to painfully read dates and times in the American 🇺🇸 format. Please accept our apologies. 😎

### Enhancements
* Better support for JSON Patch. Now supporting RFC 7386 `application/merge-patch+json` and RFC 6902 `application/json-patch+json`. Note that you may still make a request using the `PATCH` HTTP method using `application/json` and the current behavior should not be changed. All `patch*` methods found in the FusionAuth client libraries will still be using `application/json` for backwards compatibility. However, now that support for these new content types exists, we will be working to build support into our client libraries.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/441[GitHub Issue #441]
* Better developer feedback when the `Content-Type` request header is missing or incorrect.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/604[GitHub Issue #604]
* Additional SCIM support for the `PATCH` HTTP request method, and `filter` and `excludedAttributes` request attributes. The addition of these features allow the FusionAuth SCIM server to be compatible with Azure AD SCIM client and Okta SCIM client. The Group filter support has some limitations, see the the [SCIM Group](/docs/apis/scim/SCIMGroup#retrieve-a-group) API doc for additional details.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1761[GitHub Issue #1761]
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1791[GitHub Issue #1791]
* Add some missing message keys to default Theme message bundle.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1839[GitHub Issue #1839]
* Remove an un-necessary db request when validating the user security scheme for a user in the FusionAuth admin UI.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1856[GitHub Issue #1856]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.38.1" releaseDate="August 22nd, 2022" />

### Fixed
* Static resources such as CSS and JS may be missing a `Content-Type` header which may cause a proxy using `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` to fail to load the resource. This issue was introduced in version `1.37.0`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1831[GitHub Issue #1831], thanks to https://github.com/sinqinc[@sinqinc] for reporting.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1834[GitHub Issue #1834], thanks to https://github.com/Aaron-Ritter[@Aaron-Ritter] for reporting.
* Fix a potential error issue caused by a webhook handler calling back to FusionAuth which may trigger another webhook event. This fix should also improve the performance when sending many events for webhooks.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1836[GitHub Issue #1836]
* Correct behavior during login when both self-service registration and require registration features are enabled. This configuration may cause a user to be directed to the registration required page during login instead of being registered automatically. If you encounter this error, you may either upgrade or disable the require registration configuration. This appears to be a regression introduced in version `1.36.5`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1837[GitHub Issue #1837]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.38.0" releaseDate="August 17th, 2022" />

### Fixed
* Remove dead Tomcat files from Docker image
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1820[GitHub Issue #1820], thanks to https://github.com/kevcube[@kevcube] for letting us know!

### New
* Group and Group Membership Webhooks
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/633[GitHub Issue #633], thanks to https://github.com/JLyne[@JLyne], https://github.com/ric-sapasap[@ric-sapasap] and https://github.com/rabshire[@rabshire] for the feedback!

<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.37.2" releaseDate="August 11th, 2022" />

### Fixed
* A regression error was introduced in version `1.37.0` that causes HTTP request headers to be malformed when being sent to a Webhook, Generic Messenger or a Generic Connector.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1818[GitHub Issue #1818]

### Enhancements

* In version `1.37.0` you may now create a user in the FusionAuth admin UI optionally performing email verification. The UI controls and messaging have been enhanced to remove potential confusion.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1819[GitHub Issue #1819]



<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.37.1" releaseDate="August 10th, 2022" />

### Fixed
* An exception may occur while trying to capture the debug log event during an authentication request using a Connector.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1799[GitHub Issue #1799]
* When configuring a User Action to prevent login and using that event with the Failed Login configuration, if you configure the User Action to email the user, the email will not be sent.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1801[GitHub Issue #1801]
* Kickstart fails because it does not wait for FusionAuth to complete startup.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1816[GitHub Issue #1816]
* Creating an application in the FusionAuth admin UI may fail due to a licensing error if you do not have an Enterprise license.

### Known Issues
* Kickstart fails because it does not wait for FusionAuth to complete startup.
** Resolved in version `1.37.1` via https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1816[GitHub Issue #1816]
* Creating an application in the FusionAuth admin UI may fail due to a licensing error if you do not have an Enterprise license.
** Resolved in version `1.37.1` via https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1817[GitHub Issue #1817]
* A regression error was introduced in version `1.37.0` that causes HTTP request headers to be malformed when being sent to a Webhook, Generic Messenger or a Generic Connector.
** Resolved in version `1.37.2` via https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1818[GitHub Issue #1818]
* Static resources such as CSS and JS may be missing a `Content-Type` header which may cause a proxy using `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` to fail to load the resource.
** Resolved in version `1.38.1` via https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1831[GitHub Issue #1831]
* A two-factor trust may expire early causing a user to be prompted to complete two-factor during login.
** Resolved in version `1.40.2` via https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1905[GitHub Issue #1905]
* A theme issue may exist on a form action and may cause breaking changes when upgrading to this version.
** If you are upgrading, please verify your theme files accurately create a form action.  The following themes should be updated as follows:
*** OAuth authorize -> `action="/oauth2/authorize"`
*** Child registration not allowed -> `action="/oauth2/child-registration-not-allowed"`
*** OAuth passwordless -> `action="/oauth2/passwordless"`
*** OAuth register -> `action="/oauth2/register"`
*** OAuth two factor -> `action="/oauth2/two-factor"`
*** Change password form -> `action="/password/change"`
*** Forgot password -> `action="/password/forgot"`

### Security

* Allow deprecated XML signature algorithms that were removed in Java 17. It is still not recommended that you use any of these legacy SHA1 algorithms, but if you are unable to utilize a modern algorithm, they will be allowed.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1814[GitHub Issue #1814]

### Changed

* Windows install has been removed. Our strategy is to support Windows using [WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) with our provided debian package. Please plan to utilize this strategy, and open a GitHub issue if you encounter issues with the installation.
** Due to customer feedback, a native Windows installation option has been restored as of version `1.40.0`.
* Webhooks are no longer configured as "All applications" or limited to a single Application. They are now scoped to one or more tenants. If you previously had multiple webhooks configured within the same tenant, but scoped to separate Applications you will want to review your configuration and filter events in your own Webhook handler by the `applicationId`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1812[GitHub Issue #1812]
* Deprecate Apache Tomcat specific configuration. See the [Configuration](/docs/reference/configuration) reference for additional detail.
** `fusionauth-app.http.max-header-size` The default maximum size is now `64k`.
** `fusionauth-app.http.cookie-same-site-policy` In most cases, cookies will be written using `SameSite=Lax`, and cookies used by the FusionAuth admin UI utilize `SameSite=Strict`. If you think there would be value in further customizing cookies by name, or security settings such as `SameSite`, please upvote https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1414[GitHub Issue #1414] and describe your intended use-case.
** `fusionauth-app.management.port` This was an Apache Tomcat specific port that is no longer required.
** `fusionauth-app.ajp.port` is now deprecated, this was an Apache Tomcat specific binary protocol used by Java applications.
** `fusionauth-app.http.relaxed-path-chars` This option was not likely documented or in-use by anyone.
** `fusionauth-app.http.relaxed-query-chars` This option was not likely documented or in-use by anyone.
* FastPath and normal startup commands have changed. For example, starting FusionAuth based upon Apache Tomcat used `catalina.sh` or `catalina.bat`, the startup process will now use `start.sh`. See install documentation for more details.
* When using the FusionAuth Docker image with MySQL, you will need to bundle the MySQL connector jar in the image, or add a layer to the stock FusionAuth image to ensure that `curl` is installed so that the MySQL connector jar can be downloaded it during startup. It is recommended that you build the connector into the image. See our example [Dockerfile](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/tree/master/docker/fusionauth/fusionauth-app-mysql) on GitHub for an example.

### Fixed

* Add the appropriate feedback to the users when attempting to change an email during a gated email verification that is already in-use.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1547[GitHub Issue #1547]
* Correct the validation when deleting a key from Key Master when in use by a de-activated application.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1676[GitHub Issue #1676]
* Perform implicit email verification when enabled and a setup password email request is completed.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1705[GitHub Issue #1705]
* Handle URL encoded characters in the user-information part of the URL when connecting to Elasticsearch. This allows a username or password to be provided in the URL that have been URL encoded.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1745[GitHub Issue #1745]
* When using the Change Password workflow in the hosted login pages for a user that has enabled 2FA, if you are not adding the OAuth2 parameters found in the `state` on the Change Password link built in the email template an error may occur when the user tries to complete the workflow.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1764[GitHub Issue #1764]
* The Refresh Token retrieve API and the Session tab in admin UI will no longer show expired refresh tokens. While the previous behavior was working as designed, it was confusing to some clients, and an admin was not able to manually remove expired tokens.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1772[GitHub Issue #1772]
* Fix Lambda JS validation when using ES6 features with the GraalJS engine.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1790[GitHub Issue #1790], thanks to https://github.com/theogravity[@theogravity] for reporting the issue!

### Enhancements

* Administrative Email Verification using the API or FusionAuth admin UI. When creating a user in the admin UI, you may now optionally create the user with an un-verified email when Email verification is enabled. See the [Verify Email](/docs/apis/users#verify-a-users-email) API for additional details.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1319[GitHub Issue #1319]
* The Oauth2 Logout does not log a user out of FusionAuth app if logging out of another application in the same default tenant.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1699[GitHub Issue #1699]
* Updates to our initial SCIM Server implementation released in version `1.36.0`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1702[GitHub Issue #1702]
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1703[GitHub Issue #1703]
* Better options to capture debug information when troubleshooting an SMTP connection issue. You no longer need to specify `mail.debug=true` in the advanced SMTP settings, and instead when enabling `debug` on the SMTP configuration a debug Event Log will be produced with the SMTP debug information.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1743[GitHub Issue #1743]
* Support larger email templates on MySQL. Prior to this version the `TEXT` column data type was utilized which has a maximum size of `16k` in MySQL, now we are using `MEDIUMTEXT` which supports up to `16M`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1788[GitHub #1788], thanks to https://github.com/darkeagle1337[@darkeagle1337] for making the request!
* Improvements to the OAuth2 Logout endpoint. This endpoint now correctly supports the `POST` method in addition to the `GET` method, and you may now use an expired `id_token` in the `id_token_hint` parameter.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1792[GitHub Issue #1792]
* Webhooks are now scoped to one or more tenants. Webhooks will no longer receive all events, but only events for the configured tenants. There is still an option for "All tenants" if you still wish to preserve the previous behavior.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1812[GitHub Issue #1812]
* Any API response that returns a Refresh Token will now also return a `refresh_token_id` when in OAuth2 or a `refreshTokenId` in all other APIs. This may be useful to identify a refresh token for revocation when using a one-time use Refresh Token. This identifier is the primary key of the Refresh Token and can be used by the Refresh Token API.
* The Access Token will contain a new claim named `sid` which is the immutable identifier Refresh Token. This claim is not reserved, so it can be removed and will only be present when a refresh token is requested. This is different from the `sid` claim that is already returned in the `id_token`, that `sid` or Session Identifier is the SSO session identifier and is primarily used by FusionAuth to validate a logout request.
* When available the Refresh Token is now returned in the `JWTRefreshTokenRevokeEvent` event in the `refreshToken` field.
* The Login Ping API may now optionally take the request as a POST body.

### New

* Application scoped Multi-Factor authentication. This feature allows an application choose to participate in Multi-Factor when enabled, and optionally specify a separate TTL for trust scoped to a single application.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/763[GitHub Issue #763]
* You may optionally disable the IdP linking strategy for an Identity Provider. This allows you to restrict any automatic linking and manage all IdP linking through the API.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1551[GitHub Issue #1551], thanks to https://github.com/epbensimpson[@epbensimpson] for the suggestion.
* Added `fusionauth-app.http.read-timeout` to the configuration to optionally set the maximum read timeout when making requests to FusionAuth. See the [Configuration](/docs/reference/configuration) reference for additional detail.

### Internal

* Remove Apache Tomcat as the underlying application server, in favor of a more modern HTTP server based upon Netty.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1671[GitHub Issue #1671]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.36.8" releaseDate="July 4th, 2022" />

### Fixed

* Fix the placeholder text in the entity grants search field.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1774[GitHub Issue #1774]
* Correct the SCIM HTTP response code when a new resource is created to be `201`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1775[GitHub Issue #1775]
* Correct the SCIM HTTP response code when a duplicate resource is attempted to be created to be `409`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1776[GitHub Issue #1776]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.36.7" releaseDate="June 23rd, 2022" />

### Security
* Ensure the provided `client_id` matches the Application represented by the Refresh Token when performing a Refresh grant. This is marked as a security fix because the intended design is to ensure the Refresh Token does indeed match the requested `client_id`. However, the risk is minimal due to the caller still being required to have a valid set of client credentials, and must still present a valid refresh token.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1766[GitHub Issue #1766] Thanks to https://github.com/gnarlium[@gnarlium] for reporting the issue!

### Fixed
* The initial "start" phase of a user action triggered by a failed login configuration is not sent.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1654[GitHub Issue #1654]
* When a SAML v2 SP is using an HTTP redirect binding during the Logout request FusionAuth make fail to complete the logout request.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1723[GitHub Issue #1723]
* A timing issue exists where under load of creating logins and then deleting applications programatically, a login record for a now deleted application may get stuck in the queue causing exceptions when attempting to write the record to the database.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1765[GitHub Issue #1765]
* Correct the `Content-Type` HTTP response header returned from the SCIM endpoints.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1769[GitHub Issue #1769]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.36.6" releaseDate="June 16th, 2022" />

### Fixed

* When using Rate Limiting for Failed logins, the user may be able to login successfully after being rate limited - but prior to the end of the configured time period.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1758[GitHub Issue #1758]
* When using a JWT Populate lambda and modifying the default value of the `aud` claim to be an array instead of a string value, this token can no longer be used by the Introspect endpoint. This fix allows you to modify the `aud` claim to be an array, and it may be used with the Introspect endpoint as long as the requested `client_id` is contained in the `aud` claim. The OAuth2 Logout endpoint was also updated to allow this same `aud` modification to be using an `id_token` as the `id_token_hint`. When using this style of token as an `id_token_hint`, the first value in the `aud` claim that is equal to a FusionAuth application Id will be utilized.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1759[GitHub Issue #1759]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.36.5" releaseDate="June 13th, 2022" />

### Security
* Upgrade Java to get the patch for [CVE-2022-21449](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21449). Note that in version `1.36.4` FusionAuth manually patched this vulnerability. To ensure you are not vulnerable to this vulnerability, upgrade to FusionAuth version `1.36.4` or later, or discontinue use of the Elliptic Curve algorithm.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1672[GitHub Issue #1672]
* Fix validation of the Oauth2 Logout endpoint when using the `post_logout_redirect` parameter. As [documented here](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/endpoints#logout), you must ensure that any value for this parameter is in the Authorized URLs list for the application. This may be a breaking change if you do not.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1750[GitHub Issue #1750]

### Fixed
* Fix a UI bug that caused the application column to show "Single sign-on" instead of the Application name in the Session tab of the user management panel.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1706[GitHub Issue #1706]
*  If you have enabled Two-Factor authentication and self-service registration, a user may not be routed to the Complete Registration step correctly after completing the Two-Factor challenge.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1708[GitHub Issue #1708], thanks to https://github.com/chimericdream[@chimericdream] for reporting the issue!
* The `displayName` property on the [Link a User](/docs/apis/identity-providers/links#link-a-user) API is ignored. This is a regression bug that was introduced in version `1.36.0`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1728[GitHub Issue #1728]
* A 3rd party Web Application Firewall such as CloudFlare may inject JavaScript into the `<head>` element and this may cause a failure to properly initialize support for an Identity Provider such as Twitter.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1731[GitHub Issue #1731], thanks to https://github.com/atakane[@atakane] for helping us track this one down!

### Internal
* Upgrade to the latest Java 17 LTS. Upgraded from 17.0.1+12 to 17.0.3+7.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1672[GitHub Issue #1672]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.36.4" releaseDate="April 21st, 2022" />

### Security
* Proactive patch for Java [CVE-2022-21449](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21449). This release will patch the vulnerability described in the referenced CVE until we are able to release a version of FusionAuth using the upcoming patched release of Java. If you are not able to upgrade to this release, discontinue use of ECDSA keys in FusionAuth for JWT or SAML signing.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1694[GitHub Issue #1694]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.36.3" releaseDate="April 19th, 2022" />

### Fixed
* An additional edge case was identified in the issue resolved by https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1687[GitHub Issue #1687]. If you did encounter the issue resolved by https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1687[GitHub Issue #1687], you should plan to upgrade to this patch version so that you can fully utilize the new `auth_time` claim introduced in `1.36.0`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1688[GitHub Issue #1688]

<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.36.2" releaseDate="April 14th, 2022" />

### Fixed
* If you are using the `openid` scope which produces an `id_token`, and you utilize a 3rd party library that consumes the `id_token` to validate the signature, expiration or similar claims, the token may be incorrectly identified as expired. This is because after a refresh token is used to generate a new `id_token` the `auth_time` claim may have lost precision from the original value in the initial `id_token`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1687[GitHub Issue #1687]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.36.1" releaseDate="April 14th, 2022" />

### Fixed
* When building an entity grant in the UI for a user or other entity, the search results may contain entities from all tenants. If you attempt to select an entity in a tenant other than the tenant for which the user or entity belongs, an exception will occur.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1579[GitHub Issue #1579]
* If you create an empty directory in the FusionAuth plugin directory, or create a directory that does not contain any FusionAuth plugin jars, and have other plugin jars in the root of the plugin directory, the legitimate plugin jar may not be loaded. If you encounter this problem, either remove the empty directories, or make the empty directories read only.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1683[GitHub Issue #1683]
* If you are using the Client Credentials Grant and omit the permissions from the `target-entity:` scope, the expected permissions will not be returned as part of the access token claims.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1686[GitHub Issue #1686]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.36.0" releaseDate="April 7th, 2022" />

<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

### Known Issues
* If you create an empty directory in the FusionAuth plugin directory, or create a directory that does not contain any FusionAuth plugin jars, and have other plugin jars in the root of the plugin directory, the legitimate plugin jar may not be loaded. If you encounter this problem, either remove the empty directories, or make the empty directories read only.
** This has been resolved in version `1.36.1`.
* If you are using the Client Credentials Grant and omit the permissions from the `target-entity:` scope, the expected permissions will not be returned as part of the access token claims.
** This has been resolved in version `1.36.1`.
* If you are using the `openid` scope which produces an `id_token`, and you utilize a 3rd party library that consumes the `id_token` to validate the signature, expiration or similar claims, the token may be incorrectly identified as expired. This is because after a refresh token is used to generate a new `id_token` the `auth_time` claim may have lost precision from the original value in the initial `id_token`.
** This has been resolved in version `1.36.3`.

### Security
* Ensure that the Change Password identifier is revoked if an API is used to change a user's password after the user has initiated a change password request.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1632[GitHub Issue #1632]

### Changed
* The JWT authorization method is no longer supported when using the `GET` method on the [Retrieve Refresh Tokens](/docs/apis/jwt#retrieve-refresh-tokens) API.
** The reason for this potentially breaking change is due to concern of potential abuse. If you were previously using a JWT to authorize the request to the `GET` HTTP method, you will need to modify your integration to utilize an API key. See the [Retrieve Refresh Tokens](/docs/apis/jwt#retrieve-refresh-tokens) API for additional details.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1646[GitHub Issue #1646]
* Updated reserved JWT claims by grant type. The `amr` claims is marked as reserved, and will be available in a future release.
** Reserved for authorization code and implicit grant, `amr`, `exp`, `iat`, `sub` and `tid`. Only `amr` and `tid` are new for this release.
** Reserved for Vending API `amr`, `exp` and `iat`. Only the `amr` claim is new for this release.
** Reserved for Client Credentials grant, `amr`, `aud`, `exp`, `iat`, `permissions`, `sub` and `tid`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1669[GitHub Issue #1669]

### Fixed
* The requested `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` in a SAML v2 `AuthNRequest` is ignored and the first URL configured is used instead.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1278[GitHub Issue #1278], thanks to https://github.com/pakomp[@pakomp] for letting us know!
* Entities don't support the use of `:` in the permission name, this limitation has been removed.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1480[GitHub Issue #1480], thanks to https://github.com/matthewhartstonge[@matthewhartstonge] for the help!
* An application role may not be immediately available to assign to a user after initial creation. This issue was due to some additional caching introduced in version `1.32.1`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1575[GitHub Issue #1575]
* The Password Grant response is missing the Two Factor Method Ids when a Two-Factor challenge is required. This issue was introduced in version `1.26.0` when Two-Factor Method Ids were added to the Login API response.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1585[GitHub Issue #1585]
* The Tenant edit and add panel displays Webhook events that are not configured at the Tenant level.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1593[GitHub Issue #1593]
* FusionAuth may fail to start on Windows when using the `startup.bat` script. See linked issue for a workaround.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1624[GitHub Issue #1624], thanks to https://github.com/James-M-Oswald[@James-M-Oswald] for the assist!
* Enhance email validation to keep obviously incorrect emails from being used during self-service user registration.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1625[GitHub Issue #1625], thanks to https://github.com/pablomadrigal[@pablomadrigal] for letting us know!
* When using the GraalJS Lambda engine, you cannot use ECMA 6 features such as `const` or `let`.
** This only affects version `1.35.0` when using the new GraalJS engine, and does not represent a regression because prior to version `1.35.0` the only Lambda engine available was Nashorn which only supported ECMA 5.1.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1630[GitHub Issue #1630]
* When using a Connector, a timing issue exists that could cause a login to fail. See the linked issue for an example exception that you may observe if you encounter this issue.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1633[GitHub Issue #1633]
* The Tenant View dialog may show the incorrect Event transaction setting for a Tenant created via the API.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1642[GitHub Issue #1642]
* When the `openid` scope is used along with the `offline_access` scope and then the resulting refresh token is used in a Refresh grant, the returned `id_token` may be signed with the key configured for the `access_token`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1643[GitHub Issue #1643]
* Ignore read-only directories inside of the configured plugin directory instead of throwing an exception.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1655[GitHub Issue #1655]

### Enhancements
* Add a separate execute thread pool in the Apache Tomcat configuration to separate incoming requests from localhost callback requests to reduce thread contention.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1659[GitHub Issue #1659]
* Allow for plugins that require dependent jars in their classpath.
** To take advantage of this capability, create a sub-directory in the configured plugin directory. Place your plugin jar, and any dependant jars in the same directory or nested sub-directories. Each immediate sub-directory of the configured plugin directory will be considered a discrete classloader. Each of these class loaders will still share the parent classloader, so it is still advised to keep dependencies to a bare minimum such that you don't conflict with existing dependencies of FusionAuth.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1663[GitHub Issue #1663]
* Minimize the duration of the database Transaction during authentication. This should improve login performance, especially when using an LDAP or Generic Connector.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1666[GitHub Issue #1666] (666 😱 yikes)
* Alphabetize the Applications in Select form controls in the FusionAuth admin UI, this should make it easier for those are not robots to navigate when you have many applications.
** https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1668[GitHub Issue #1668]
* Allow a login using a 3rd party IdP such as Google to succeed even if an Elasticsearch exception occurs when attempting to re-index the user.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1673[GitHub Issue #1673]

### New
* Initial technology preview for SCIM Server, this feature is available in the Enterprise edition.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/106[GitHub Issue #106]
* Nintendo Online Identity Provider, this feature is available with all licensed editions of FusionAuth.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1206[GitHub Issue #1206]
* New Identity Provider Link & Unlink Events
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1589[GitHub Issue #1589]
* Default the Event Transaction Type in the Tenant configuration to `None`
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1644[GitHub Issue #1644]
* New JWT claims
** The `tid` claim is now being set in all JWTs. This is the FusionAuth Tenant Id, and is marked as reserved.
** The JWT header will also now contain a `gty` claim which will represent the grant types in order of use for this token.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1669[GitHub Issue #1669]

### Internal
* Update Apache Tomcat from `8.5.72` to `8.5.77`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1620[GitHub Issue #1620]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.35.0" releaseDate="March 10th, 2022" />

<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

### Fixed
* When using the FastPath installation for Windows, the startup may fail to download Java if you are using the `startup.bat` option for starting services.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1597[GitHub Issue #1597], thanks to https://github.com/gkrothammer[@gkrothammer] for the help!
* Using the Identity Provider Link API when more than one tenant is configured may fail unless you are specifying the tenant Id using the `X-FusionAuth-TenantId` HTTP request header.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1609[GitHub Issue #1609]
* Self-service registration may fail to validate an email address beginning with `@`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1617[GitHub Issue #1617], thanks to https://github.com/pablomadrigal[@pablomadrigal] for letting us know!
* Using the Passwordless API without passing the OAuth2 state parameters on the URL such as `client_id`, and the user is not registered for the Application, the request may fail.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1623[GitHub Issue #1623]

### New
* Initial technology preview for HTTP requests within a lambda function, termed Lambda HTTP Connect. All previously configured lambdas will continue to run on the legacy JS engine. Starting in this release the default engine for newly created lambdas will be GraalJS, but you have the ability to select the preferred engine. When using the GraalJS engine, you will be able to begin making HTTP requests within the lambda function. At some point in the future we will deprecate and fully remove the legacy JS engine (Nashorn). For the time being, use the new engine if you are able, and provide us feedback if you find anything is not working. If you do encounter a problem open an issue, and switch the lambda back to the the Nashorn engine.
** HTTP requests (AJAX) in the lambda requires Essentials or Enterprise edition.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/267[GitHub Issue #267]
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/571[GitHub Issue #571]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.34.1" releaseDate="February 23rd, 2022" />

### Fixed
* SAML v2 Login to FusionAuth may fail due to an exception.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1606[GitHub Issue #1606], thanks so much to https://github.com/kristianvld[@kristianvld] for letting us know.


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.34.0" releaseDate="February 21st, 2022" />

### Known Issues
* SAML v2 Login to FusionAuth may fail due to an exception. Please upgrade directly to FusionAuth version >= 1.34.1
** See https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1606[GitHub Issue #1606] for additional details.

### Security
* Resolve a potential vulnerability in the IdP Link API. If you are actively using any IdP configured to use the `CreatePendingLink` linking strategy, please upgrade at your earliest convenience.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1600[GitHub Issue #1600]

### Changed
* When using the OpenID Connect identity provider, you have the option to select one of three client authentication options. You may select `none`, `client_secret_basic` or `client_secret_post`. Some 3rd party identity providers do not allow the `client_id` to be sent in the request body when using `client_secret_basic`. A strict reading of the OAuth2 and OpenID Connect specifications imply that the `client_id` should only be present in the request body when a client secret is not used, or you have selected `none` or `client_secret_post` for an authentication method. This change is to make FusionAuth more compliant with 3rd party IdPs that enforce this behavior. It is not expected that this change will have any negative impact on OpenID Connect configurations that have been working up until this release. However, please be aware of this change and verify existing OpenID Connect identity providers continue to behave as expected.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1595[GitHub Issue #1595]
* Utilize PKCE anytime FusionAuth is initiating an Authorization Code grant to FusionAuth. While most of this will be transparent and should not affect any of your integrations, there is one use case in which it is important for FusionAuth to utilize PKCE when performing an Authorization Code grant to FusionAuth. This use case is when you are using an application with PKCE configured as required, and you then use the Device grant using the themed FusionAuth pages. In this case FusionAuth must utilize PKCE in order to pass PKCE validation during the request.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1598[GitHub Issue #1598]
* When using the interactive Setup Wizard to perform initial setup of FusionAuth, the checkbox to sign up for the FusionAuth newsletter has been changed to be checked by default. This means that prior to this release you had to opt-in, and starting in this release, you will need to opt-out during this step. You also have the option to un-subscribe from the newsletter at any point in the future.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1577[GitHub Issue #1577]

### New
* Native support for PBKDF2 using a 512-bit derived key length. The default PBKDF2 algorithm uses a 256-bit derived key length. Some IdPs such as KeyCloak use a 512-bit key, so this plugin should support an import from KeyCloak without using a custom plugin. This new algorithm is available using the value `salted-pbkdf2-hmac-sha256-512` during the User Import API.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1604[GitHub Issue #1604]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.33.0" releaseDate="February 7th, 2022" />

<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

### Security
* Add `-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true` to the `fusionauth-search` bundled version of Elasticsearch.
** Please note, that if you are running a standalone version of Elasticsearch, this will not affect you, and you should still complete any suggested mitigation steps for your Elasticsearch instance. This VM argument added to the `fusionauth-search` bundle is only added to make people feel warm and fuzzy. FusionAuth Cloud users are not vulnerable to [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228), and even if you are self-hosting FusionAuth and utilizing the Elasticsearch bundled with `fusionauth-search` you are not vulnerable if you have followed our suggested securing steps. Also due to the version of Java we are using to run Elasticsearch, you are not vulnerable. But we all like to put on our tinfoil hats sometimes, so we are making this change for good measure.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1520[GitHub Issue #1520]
* Updated PostgreSQL JDBC driver from version `42.2.22` to `42.3.2`.
** This update is only pertinent to you if you are using a PostgreSQL database. If you are using MySQL, you are not vulnerable.
** FusionAuth Cloud users are not affected. If you are self-hosting FusionAuth you are only vulnerable if you allow un-authorized modifications to your JDBC connection string used by FusionAuth to connect to the database. I hope you are not doing this. 😉 Please read the following CVE to better understand the vulnerability to see how it may or may not affect you.
** [CVE-2022-21724](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21724).
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1535[GitHub Issue #1535]
* Proactively upgrade Logback. Instead of Log4J, FusionAuth uses Logback. In response to the recent vulnerabilities in Log4J, the Logback team has proactively added some additional hardening to their library to ensure similar vulnerabilities are not found.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1530[GitHub Issue #1530]
* Better protection against malicious actors that have access to configuring Themed templates.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1549[GitHub Issue #1549]
* Ensure we enforce a Two-Factor challenge before changing a password using the Change Password API.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1591[GitHub Issue #1591]

### Changed
* If you are using the Change Password API with users that have Two-Factor enabled you may need to adjust your integration. Beginning in this release, to use the Change Password API for a user with Two-Factor enabled, you will need to obtain a Trust Token from the Two Factor Login API in order to complete this request. This is potentially a breaking change, the decision was made to make this potentially breaking change due to the enhanced security provided by this change.

** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1591[GitHub Issue #1591]

### Fixed
* The FastPath install may fail to download Java on versions `>= 1.32.0`. The issue was that the `curl` request needed to be configured to follow a redirect with the new URLs for the Java download.  See the linked issue for a workaround if you want to use FastPath for an older version.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1519[GitHub Issue #1519]
* Ensure we are able to handle Login records that may contain more than one IP address. When passing through a proxy, the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP request header may contain more than one IP address. This fix ensures we parse this header correctly and handle existing Login records that may have been recorded with more than one value.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1521[GitHub Issue #1521]
* Using the Login with Apple button on a themed login or registration page may fail when using Safari on iOS 12. A workaround is documented in the linked GitHub issue if you are unable to upgrade FusionAuth.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1526[GitHub Issue #1526]
* The Event Log, Audit Log, Login Records search feature in the FusionAuth Admin UI may not reset the pagination correctly when beginning a new search request.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1501[GitHub Issue #1501]
* Group Membership may not be preserved after the first login request when using a Connector without migration.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1432[GitHub Issue #1432]
* The `jwt.refresh-token.revoke` event may not be sent during a request to the Logout API (`/api/logout`).
** Resolves   https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1522[GitHub Issue #1522], thanks to https://github.com/TimVanHerwijnen[@TimVanHerwijnen] for all the help!
* A consent added to a self-service registration form may show up incorrectly during a complete registration step during login.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1259[GitHub Issue #1259]
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1261[GitHub Issue #1261]
* Better support for `user.birthDate` when using Advanced self-service registration when Family is enabled with child registration.
** https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1490[GitHub Issue #1490]
* When configuring more than one preferred language in the FusionAuth Admin UI on the User or User Registration, the order may not be preserved. For example, if you configured `French, English` where `French` is the preferred languages, with a second option of `English`, when saving the form, the serialized value will become `English, French` and will not likely be saved in the order you expect.
** https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1131[GitHub Issue #1131]
* Fix a potential memory leak in the Email services. If you are sending a lot of email through FusionAuth, this error may cause your FusionAuth service to run out of memory. Restarting the service periodically can mitigate this potential if you are unable to upgrade. This issue was most likely introduced in version `1.30.1`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1548[GitHub Issue #1548]
* When completing a Family workflow where a parent joins a child to a family, the `parentEmail` field may not be properly updated in the search index.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1550[GitHub Issue #1550]
* If you have previously configured Basic Self-Service registration, and then begin using Advanced Self-Service it is possible that a validation may occur that you did not expect.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1560[GitHub Issue #1560]
* Some edge cases exist when using the Async Tenant Delete API or deleting a Tenant in the FusionAuth Admin UI where a tenant may get stuck in the Pending Delete state.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1559[GitHub Issue #1559]

### Enhancements
* Add the underlying host architecture and operating system name and version to the About panel in the FusionAuth admin UI. See <strong>System -> About</strong>.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1531[GitHub Issue #1531]
* Add a tooltip to the Webhook Application configuration to help reduce some confusion until we deprecate this Application configuration.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1542[GitHub Issue #1542]
* Support longer Refresh Tokens on the Refresh Tokens Import API. The previous limitation was that the refresh token was less than or equal to `191` characters. The assumption was made that this token was opaque and that `191` was very adequate. Some IdPs utilize JWTs for Refresh Tokens and in this case, the length is likely to exceed the previous limitation. This enhancements allows for longer refresh tokens. In particular this will provide better support for importing Refresh Tokens from KeyCloak. See the [Import Refresh Tokens](/docs/apis/users#import-refresh-tokens) API for additional details.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1541[GitHub Issue #1541]
* Use a better thread pooling strategy for Webhooks to better support a very large volume of events where the event recipient may not respond quickly enough. This allows more events to be queued up if we cannot send them fast enough while waiting for a response from the webhook.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1500[GitHub Issue #1500]
* Improve licensing errors on the API and FusionAuth Admin UI to better differentiate between not licensed, and a feature that requires a specific licensed feature. In particular, some of the features introduced as part of the Threat Detection feature require an Enterprise License with this feature enabled. So you may have a licensed edition of FusionAuth, and a feature may still not be available. This change should make it clearer why a particular feature cannot be enabled.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1555[GitHub Issue #1555]
* Add `tokenExpirationInstant` to the Login Response similar to how the Token endpoint response returns `expires_in` to indicate when the access token returned in the response will expire.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1309[GitHub Issue #1309]

<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.32.1" releaseDate="December 13th, 2021" />

### Fixed
* If you are modifying the user email or username in an Identity Provider Reconcile Lambda, the lambda may be invoked more than once after the initial link has been established. This may cause User registration data to be modified, or lost. If you have not yet upgraded to this version, it is advised that you wait until you can update to version `1.32.1`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1517[GitHub Issue #1517], thanks to https://github.com/Oceanswave[@Oceanswave] for letting us know and for the fantastic bug write up!
* The `1.32.0` version of the Docker image was initially released with a missing Java module that may cause the image to fail during startup. An updated version of the image has been released, if you encounter an issue, please delete your local version of the image and pull it again. The issue is also resolved in this version, so you may also pull the `latest` tag once this version is available.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1518[GitHub Issue #1518]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.32.0" releaseDate="December 10th, 2021" />

<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

### Changed
* This version of FusionAuth will now run on Java 17. If you are using any SAML v2 IdP configurations that still utilize a legacy XML signature algorithm, this upgrade may break that integration.
** It is recommended to test your SAML v2 IdP logins with this version prior to upgrading, or confirm that all of your IdPs are not using any of the following restricted XML signature algorithms:
*** `\http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#sha1`
*** `\http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#dsa-sha1`
*** `\http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-sha1`
** See https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-site/issues/1202[GitHub Issue #1202] for additional details and an optional workaround if you are unable to discontinue use of these algorithms.

### Fixed
* The global and application registration count rollup may fail when using PostgreSQL. This will cause the registration count reports to be incorrect.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1498[GitHub Issue #1498]
* When using the Development Reset feature (technical preview) and the FusionAuth application is configured to use a specific theme, the reset will fail.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1514[GitHub Issue #1514]

### Enhancements
* Identity provider linking that was introduced in version 1.28.0 can now optionally be configured to limit the number of unique links to an IdP for a particular user.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1310[GitHub Issue #1310]
* Allow application URIs to be configured as an OAuth2 Authorized request origin URLs. For example, you may now configure `android-app://com.example` as a valid Authorized request origin.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1443[GitHub Issue #1443], thanks to https://github.com/bonify-b2b[@bonify-b2b] for the request.
* Add configuration to allow implicit email verification to be disabled. For example, prior to this release, email based workflows such as Passwordless login, email based registration verification, email based password change, and verifying a two-factor code during login through an email would implicitly mark a user's email as verified if email verification was enabled and the user had not yet completed email verification. In most cases this seems to be the best choice for the end user such that they do not perform redundant tasks to verify their email address once they have provided evidence they have access to the email address. This configuration allows this behavior to be disabled if you wish to require your end user to always go through a specific email verification process for legal or other similar reasons.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1467[GitHub Issue #1467], thanks to https://github.com/lliu-20200701[@lliu-20200701] for the request.
* Add a notice on the Device workflow panel when an existing SSO session exists to allow the user to optionally logout prior to continuing.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1495[GitHub Issue #1495]

### New
* You may optionally specify custom SMTP headers in the Tenant email configuration. These configured headers will be added to all outbound messages.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/628[GitHub Issue #628], thanks to [arni-inaba](https://github.com/arni-inaba) for the suggestion.

### Internal
* Java 17 LTS. Update to the latest long term support version of Java.


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.31.0" releaseDate="November 18th, 2021" />

### Known Issues
* If you are modifying the user email or username in an Identity Provider Reconcile Lambda, the lambda may be invoked more than once after the initial link has been established. This may cause User registration data to be modified, or lost. If you have not yet upgraded to this version, it is advised that you wait until you can update to version `1.32.1`.
** Resolved in `1.32.1` by https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1517[GitHub Issue #1517]

### Changed
* You may now modify, or fabricate an email or username in the Identity Provider Reconcile Lambda regardless of the Identity Provider type.
** Some of this capability has been provided in the past for the OpenID Connect Identity Provider. This capability was removed in version `1.28.0` when Identity Provider Linking was introduced due to the additional use cases now supported through linking strategies. Due to high demand, and many real world use-cases presented by our users, this decision has been reversed in favor of flexibility for the developer. Please use caution when using this capability, and note that if you create or modify a `username` or `email` in the Reconcile lambda, the lambda will be invoked twice during a single login request.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1425[GitHub Issue #1425]

** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1473[GitHub Issue #1473]
* When using the Setup Password email template provided by FusionAuth with the User Registration API to create a User and a Registration in a single API call the URL generated and sent to the user may not be usable. A `client_id` will have been added to the URL which will result in an error when the FusionAuth page is rendered. To work around the issue prior to this release, please remove the `client_id` from the Email template.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1476[GitHub Issue #1476]

### Known Issues
* If you are referencing any Reconcile Lambda Ids using the syntax `FUSIONAUTH_LAMBDA{type}_ID` - this may no longer work due to a change in how these default lambdas are initialized.
** The current work around is to modify your kickstart to build your own version of this lambda instead of using the FusionAuth default.
** You will find a copy of the default lambdas shipped with FusionAuth in the [Lambda](/docs/extend/code/lambdas/overview) documentation that you may use to copy into your kickstart.
** The issue is being tracked here https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1373[GitHub Issue #1373]

### Fixed
* Unable to enable `user.action` event at the tenant using the UI. If you encounter this issue, you may work around it by using the Tenant API.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1307[GitHub Issue #1307]
* If you make an API request to `/api/two-factor/login` with an empty JSON body, an exception will occur instead of a validation error being returned with a `400` status code.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1330[GitHub Issue #1330]
* When using an IdP with a linking mode other than Create Pending Link, the token may not correctly be stored. If you previously had been using the token stored on the User Registration, and are now looking for it in the Identity Provider Link, you may not find it. This fix resolves the issue.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1341[GitHub Issue #1341]
* When you are using FusionAuth as a SAML v2 IdP with Redirect bindings, you were unable to use idp_hint to bypass the login page to federate to another provider.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1331[GitHub Issue #1331]


### Changed
* New themed page added for Unauthorized access.
** See the [Theme](/docs/apis/themes) API and the [Theme](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/overview) documentation for additional details.

** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/525[GitHub Issue #525]
* FusionAuth wasn't awesome enough, so we added a robust Threat Detection feature for enterprise customers. This feature includes:
* IP Access Control for API keys
** This allows support for an API key to be further restricted by the origin IP address.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/933[GitHub Issue #933]
* IP Access Control for SSO and self service forms
** This allows you to limit access to the FusionAuth SSO or a particular application login through SSO by IP address

<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.29.4" releaseDate="August 12th, 2021" />

### Fixed
* When a user is required to complete registration after login, the user may no longer be able to login w/out a password reset. This is a regression from version 1.28.0, and only affects those using self-service registration that will have existing users that do not have all required fields on their account.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1344[GitHub Issue #1344], thanks to https://github.com/flangfeldt[@flangfeldt] for reporting the issue

<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.29.1" releaseDate="July 26th, 2021" />

<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

### Fixed
* In a multi-tenant configuration, SSO sessions may be pre-maturely terminated if one tenant has a lower TTL configuration than the other tenants. To work around this issue prior to this release, ensure all SSO TTL configurations are equal.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1262[GitHub Issue #1262]
* The arg names in the `LambdaType` enum were not all correct.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1284[GitHub Issue #1284]

** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1317[GitHub Issue #1317]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.29.0" releaseDate="July 10th, 2021" />

### Fixed
* When viewing the theme preview for the `oauth2/start-idp-link.ftl` template, and error may be logged.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1276[GitHub Issue #1276]
* When a webhook transaction fails to create a user or registration on a themed page, a non-themed error page may be displayed
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1279[GitHub Issue #1279]

### Enhancements
* Enhance the Link API to retrieve a user by a 3rd party unique Id to identify a FusionAuth user is linked to the user. See the [Link](/docs/apis/identity-providers/links) API for additional details.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1277[GitHub Issue #1277]
* During a device link request which contains a device linking token, show an intermediate page asking the user if they would like to sign in with an existing user or create a new user.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1287[GitHub Issue #1287]
* Allow the IdP Login API to optionally be passed a request parameter to indicate a link should not be established and a `404` should be returned instead. This is useful if you wish to identify if a link exists first before starting an auxiliary workflow such as a device grant with a linking token. See the [Login](/docs/apis/identity-providers/overview) API for additional details.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1288[GitHub Issue #1288]
* Add additional configuration to the unique username configuration to support always appending a suffix even when the username is not in use. See the [Tenant](/docs/apis/tenants) API for additional details.

** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1293[GitHub Issue #1293]
* In version `1.28.0` the resolution of the value returned by the SAML v2 IdP in the `NameID` was modified. If the IdP returns a format of `unspecified` with a value of `email` then after upgrading to version `1.28.0` your SAML IdP will not function properly. Ideally you would ask your IdP to return you a NameID format of `emailAddress`, but if that is not possible this enhancement will allow FusionAuth to accept the value returned in the `NameID` if the format is returned as `unspecified`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1294[GitHub Issue #1294]
* Instead of logging FreeMarker exceptions to the system log and producing a stack trace that may end up in the UI, an event log will be produced. The message in the UI will be condensed based upon the runtime mode. When in `development` mode some details will be provided to assist in debugging your themed template. If in `production` runtime mode only a message indicating an error occurred will be displayed to the user.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1299[GitHub Issue #1299]

### Internal
* Update HikariCP from `3.4.1` to `4.0.3`, and update PostgreSQL JDBC driver from `42.2.14` to `42.2.22`

* Better parsing of the `X-Fowarded-For` HTTP request header. This header may contain one to many IP addresses, and only the first value should be preserved for the login record. Prior to this fix, it would be possible to see a login record that contained multiple IP addresses separated by a comma.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1267[GitHub Issue #1267]
* Correctly show the Verification URL in the OAuth2 configuration when the `Device` grant is selected. This issue was introduced in `1.28.0`.

* Use the correct FusionAuth redirect URL when using the Sony Playstation Network IdP.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1269[GitHub Issue #1269]
* Use the correct FusionAuth redirect URL when using the Steam IdP. This IdP uses an Implicit grant and should be using the `/oauth2/callback/implicit` callback URL.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1272[GitHub Issue #1272]
* Allow the Epic Games IdP to function properly when omitting the `scope` configuration property.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1273[GitHub Issue #1273]

<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.28.0" releaseDate="June 7rd, 2021" />

<GeneralMigrationWarning warning_message="pass:normal[The FusionAuth identity providers have undergone a significant improvement to add additional flexibility and support for 3rd parties. Please take time to test this upgrade with your existing configuration to ensure compatibility. Some of the features in this release are in tech-preview.]" />

<DatabaseMigrationWarning warning_message="pass:normal[The FusionAuth identity providers have undergone a significant improvement to add additional flexibility and support for 3rd parties. Please take time to test this upgrade with your existing configuration to ensure compatibility. Some of the features in this release are in tech-preview.]" />

### Known Issues
* If you are using self-service registration there is a possibility that a user may be required to complete registration by adding additional fields to their account after they login. In this scenario it is possible that they will no longer be able to login and will be required to reset their password. The fix for this was added in `1.29.4`.
** Fixed in `1.29.4`, under https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1344[GitHub Issue #1344], thanks to https://github.com/flangfeldt[@flangfeldt] for reporting the issue
* If you are using the [SAML v2 Populate Lambda](/docs/v1/tech/lambdas/samlv2-response-populate) or the [SAML v2 Reconcile Lambda](/docs/v1/tech/lambdas/samlv2-response-reconcile) the `NameID` field has been changed to an array. You will need to update your lambda code if you are using this field.

### Changed
* You may no longer build a synthetic email address using a lambda for an OpenID Connect identity provider. This has been removed because you may now link a user by username or create a link w/out a username or an email to an existing FusionAuth user. If you are using this feature, you may need to plan for a migration to this new behavior. If you have a support contract with FusionAuth, please reach out and ask for additional information.
* When using FusionAuth as a SAML IdP, FusionAuth will now accept `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent` in addition to `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress`. This should allow FusionAuth to work with SAML v2 service providers that only support the persistent NameID format.
* Tokens returned by IdPs are no longer stored on the User Registration object in the `tokens` field. Each token is now stored with the IdP link for the User and the IdP. See the [Link](/docs/apis/identity-providers/links) API for additional details.

### New
* Reindex API
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1232[GitHub Issue #1232]
** See the [Reindex](/docs/apis/system#rebuild-the-elasticsearch-index) API for usage.
* Account Link API
** This API will allow you to link and un-link users in 3rd party identity providers with a FusionAuth user.
** See the [Link](/docs/apis/identity-providers/links) API for usage.
* IdP Linking options
** Each Identity Provider may now be configured with a linking strategy. The strategies will include linking by email, username, anonymous or a link to an existing user.
** Linking by username is now supported. There is a higher risk of account takeover using this strategy, you should use caution when using this feature.
** Tokens from identity providers should now be retrieved from the link, rather than the registration. More information can be found under `identityProviderLink.token` response value [here](/docs/apis/identity-providers/links#retrieve-a-link)
* Email Send API allows an email address in the To field instead of only allowing FusionAuth userIds
** See the [Email Send](/docs/apis/emails#send-an-email) API for additional details.
* SAML Identity Provider can now be configured to use any NameID format. Previously only the Email NameID format was utilized.
** This should allow the SAML identity provider configuration to be more flexible and work with additional SAML identity providers.

### Enhanced
* When FusionAuth is acting as a SAML Identity Provider, you may now send a NameID format of Email or Persistent.
** This should allow FusionAuth to work with additional SAML service providers such as Slack.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/522[GitHub Issue #522]
* The [Email Send](/docs/apis/emails#send-an-email) API now allows you to send to a user that does not yet exist in FusionAuth by allowing you to specify an email address for the `To:` field.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/743[GitHub Issue #743]
** See the  [Email Send](/docs/apis/login) API for additional details.
* The Facebook and Google Identity Providers will now default to using a redirect instead of a popup for login. All existing configurations will be migrated to use the popup dialog to remain consistent with the previous behavior. With this update you may now also use the `idp_hint` parameter to login with Facebook and Google.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/909[GitHub Issue #909]
* Additional PKCE and Client Authentication configuration
** You may now optionally configure PKCE as required, not required, or required when not using a confidential client. This offers better compatibility when multiple client types (a webapp and a mobile app, for example) are authenticating against a single FusionAuth application.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1152[GitHub Issue #1152]
* Add the currently selected Two Factor method object to the Themed Two Factor page `/oauth2/two-factor`
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1237[GitHub Issue #1237], thanks to one of our MVPs - https://github.com/flangfeldt[@flangfeldt] for the suggestion!
* Allow using IdP buttons on the Themed registration page
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/554[GitHub Issue #554], thanks to https://github.com/gordody[@gordody] for the request!
* When using email verification required with the gated configuration, optionally send the user another email before entering the gated page if the user does not have an existing verification email that is not expired.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1247[GitHub Issue #1247], thanks to https://github.com/lliu-20200701[@lliu-20200701] for the suggestion.

### Fixed
* Do not add the `NotBefore` assertion on the SAML AuthN response on the subject confirmation.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1215[GitHub Issue #1215], thanks to https://github.com/pakomp[@pakomp] for pointing out this issue!
* When importing users with `passwordChangeRequired=true` w/out specifying the change reason an exception may occur during login.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1245[GitHub Issue #1245], thanks to https://github.com/lliu-20200701[@lliu-20200701] for finding this bug.
* When using the email verification gate and self-service registration if a user requires their email to be verified and is forced through the complete registration flow they will not be correctly gated.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1246[GitHub Issue #1246], thanks to https://github.com/lliu-20200701[@lliu-20200701] for reporting!
* Fix a JavaScript bug that may cause some of the themed pages to render incorrectly in the view window.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1228[GitHub Issue #1228], thanks to https://github.com/flangfeldt[@flangfeldt] for reporting!

### Fixed
* When building a new theme starting with 1.27.0, you may encounter a JavaScript error during page render. This error should not cause any end user failures, but the login may not properly capture the browser type.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1216[GitHub Issue #1216]



<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.27.1" releaseDate="May 7th, 2021" />

### Fixed

### Changed
* Login API now returns `213` for Registration Not Verified.
** See the [Login](/docs/apis/login) API response for additional details.
* The Login API and the User API may optionally return a `emailVerificationId` or `registrationVerificationId` to assist the developer in completing a verification workflow when the verification strategy has been configured to use a short code instead of a long "clickable" link.
** See the [Login](/docs/apis/login) API response for additional details.
* The Verify Email API now takes the `verificationId` in the request body instead of a URL segment. See the [Verify Email](/docs/apis/users#verify-a-users-email) API for additional details.

<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.26.1" releaseDate="April 20th, 2021" />

### Fixed
* If you use a non default theme for the FusionAuth default tenant, you may see an error when trying to log in to the admin UI after upgrading to version 1.25.0. You can workaround this by appending `?&bypassTheme=true` to your login URL, or append `/admin/` to your base FusionAuth URL to log into the admin UI.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1175[GitHub Issue #1175].

### Known Issues
* You cannot create a "SAML v2 IdP Initiated" Identity Provider in the admin UI; it isn't present in the "Add Identity Providers" dropdown. You can workaround this by entering the URL to add an Identity Provider manually: `\https://auth.example.com/admin/identity-provider/add/SAMLv2IdPInitiated` (append `/admin/identity-provider/add/SAMLv2IdPInitiated` to your FusionAuth base URL). Tracking in https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1181[GitHub Issue #1181].



<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.26.0" releaseDate="April 20th, 2021" />

*Two Factor APIs* \
Breaking changes. If you use this functionality, please review the API changes and test before upgrading. \
The Two-Factor API, two-factor fields on the User and Import User APIs and the Integrations API have changed and are not backwards compatible. If you use this functionality, please review the API changes and test before upgrading. \
*Upgrading from < 1.7.0* \
If you are upgrading from a version less than 1.7.0, you must do a two stage upgrade. Upgrade to a version greater than or equal to 1.7.0 but less than 1.26.0, then upgrade from that version to 1.26.0. There were internal migration changes which necessitate this two stage process. \
*Accessing the admin Login after upgrading:* \
The `/` path of FusionAuth no longer automatically forwards to the admin login. To access the Admin UI to complete this configuration append `/admin/` to the URL. Once the theme configuration is complete, this root page will contain links to login and instructions on how to utilize this root landing page.]

* The Import API has changed for enabling Two-Factor.
**  See the [User Import](/docs/apis/users#import-users) API for changes.
* The User API has changed for enabling and disabling Two-Factor. See the [User](/docs/apis/users) API for changes.
** See the [User](/docs/apis/users) API for changes.
* Email and SMS Two-Factor methods will now require a paid edition of FusionAuth. [Learn more about paid editions](/pricing).
** If you are only using Authenticator/TOTP for Two-Factor, this functionality will continue to work properly in the community edition.
* If you are upgrading from a version less than 1.7.0, you must do a two stage upgrade. Upgrade to a version greater than or equal to 1.7.0 but less than 1.26.0, then upgrade from that version to 1.26.0. There were internal migration changes which necessitate this two stage process.

See additional details in the New section below.]" />

### Changed
* In support of the SAML v2 Logout feature, the following theme changes have been made.
** New themed template `SAMLv2 logout template`. This template will be rendered when you utilize the SAML v2 Logout feature, it is nearly identical to the existing OAuth2 logout themed page. If you are using themes, please review your theme to ensure your user experience is not interrupted.

### Fixed
* If you are using Elasticsearch version 6 you may encounter an error when using the Search API. This is due to a change in how we optionally request the document hit count in the search request to Elasticsearch. The change is not compatible with Elasticsearch version 6. As a work around, you can set `accurateTotal=true` in the API request. See the [User Search](/docs/apis/users#search-for-users) API for additional details on using this parameter.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1135[GitHub Issue #1135]
* Using the HTTP `PATCH` method on the FusionAuth application may produce erroneous validation errors.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1110[GitHub Issue #1110]
* Adding additional Java options in the configuration file when the value contains a space may not work correctly.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1065[GitHub Issue #1065]
* A `NullPointerException` may occur when you have users registered for an application in a non default tenant and you create a login report for only that application. Thanks to https://github.com/NikolayMetchev[@NikolayMetchev] for filing this.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1115[GitHub Issue #1115]
* When you omit the `state` parameter on the Authorization request, you may receive a `state` parameter on the `redirect_uri` that you did not expect.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1113[GitHub Issue #1113]

### New
* Add full support for SAML v2 Logout
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1137[GitHub Issue #1137]

### Enhancements
* Add a button to the Sessions tab in the FusionAuth admin UI to delete all user sessions at once, this action is also available from the drop down action list when managing a user.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1094[GitHub Issue #1094]
* Add Debug to OAuth2 grants, this will primarily assist in debugging the Authorization Code grant auth code exchange with the Token endpoint.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/781[GitHub Issue #781]
* Add CORS Debug, this will assist you in debugging CORS related `403` HTTP status codes.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1126[GitHub Issue #1126]
* Better SMTP debug for specific scenarios. This should assist with async connection issues and provide context to the tenant and template being rendered during the exception.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1064[GitHub Issue #1064]
* Allow the Registration API to accept the `applicationId` as a URL segment
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1127[GitHub Issue #1127]
* Twitter IdP Login API can optionally accept an access token. When building your own login page, if you complete the initial step with Twitter and utilize the `oauth_verifier` to perform some initial processing of the Twitter user, you may now still send the access token in the form of `oauth_token` and `oauth_token_secret` to FusionAuth to complete the login. This is done by omitting the `oauth_verifier` on the Login request. See [Complete the Twitter Login](/docs/apis/identity-providers/twitter#complete-the-twitter-login) for additional information.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1073[GitHub Issue #1073]
* When Key Master generates a `kid` because one is not provided on the request, if there is a public key, generate the `kid` as a JWK thumbprint instead of a randomly generated value.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1136[GitHub Issue #1136]
* When using the Search feature in the FusionAuth admin UI, once you begin searching using a specific term or any of the advanced controls, the pagination result total will be an accurate representation of the number of matches returned by Elasticsearch. When no search criteria is provided, the number of matches will cap at the default value of 10,000 and the pagination results will indicate 10,000+ which means at least 10,000 users match the search criteria.

### Internal
* Upgrade Tomcat from version `8.5.57` to `8.5.63`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1119[GitHub Issue #1119]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.24.0" releaseDate="February 11th, 2021" />

### Known Issues
* If you are using Elasticsearch version 6 you may encounter an error when using the Search API. This is due to a change in how we optionally request the document hit count in the search request to Elasticsearch. The change is not compatible with Elasticsearch version 6. As a work around, you can set `accurateTotal=true` in the API request.
** Resolved in `1.25.0`, see https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1135[GitHub Issue #1135] for additional details.

### Security
* More consistent usage of the `Cache-Control` HTTP response header. The default for all pages will be `Cache-Control: no-cache`, and some pages that may contain potentially sensitive information such as the API key add, edit or index pages will use a `Cache-Control: no-store`. No known vulnerability exists with the previous behavior, this is just a proactive change to limit the possible mis-use of cached pages in the FusionAuth admin UI.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1103[GitHub Issue #1103]
* A vulnerability in an underlying SAML v2 library was resolved. If you are using SAML please upgrade FusionAuth to 1.24.0 or later as soon as possible.
** [CVE-2021-27736](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-27736)
** [CSNC-2021-004](https://www.compass-security.com/fileadmin/Research/Advisories/2021-03_CSNC-2021-004_FusionAuth_SAML_Library_XML_External_Entity.txt)

### Changed

* The `applicationId` and `roles` claims are no longer returned in the `id_token` issued when requesting the `openid` scope. The `id_token` should not be used for authorization, this change makes it less likely to mis-use this token. If you have a requirement for these claims (you shouldn't), you can add them back by using a JWT Populate lambda. See [Id Token claims](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/tokens#id-token) for additional information.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1102[GitHub Issue #1102]

### Fixed
* When using the Add or Edit Identity Provider forms in the admin UI, if you have ~2,000 or more applications it is possible for the form request to be truncated by the underlying application server. This error is caused by the maximum number of request parameters being exceeded. This form in particular, along with the Group Add/Edit and Webhook Add/Edit contains a number of fields that is a function of the number of applications configured. An informational error may be written to the system log indicating this truncation has occurred, but no hard error would have occurred. The symptom will be that depending upon your configuration, a portion of it may be lost during this form submit. The entry in the log will contain this message `org.apache.tomcat.util.http.Parameters.processParameters More than the maximum number of request parameters (GET plus POST) for a single request ([10,000]) were detected. Any parameters beyond this limit have been ignored.`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1057[GitHub Issue #1057]
* When you have registered a custom plugin for password hashing, using the View Tenant dialog may fail to render.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1063[GitHub Issue #1063]
* Unable to remove a User from a Group using the admin UI dialog. This was a regression issue introduced in version 1.23.0.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1081[GitHub Issue #1081]
* If a user was not currently in the Elasticsearch index, the user delete request may fail.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1088[GitHub Issue #1088]
* The JWT returned from the Register API when you are creating a User and a Registration in one request may not contain the `roles` claim. This occurs when you do not assign the roles explicitly on the request, and instead are using default role assignment in the application configuration.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1106[GitHub Issue #1106]
* Updating a User that has existing group memberships may no longer be searchable in Elasticsearch by their Group memberships until the next time the user logs into FusionAuth.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1087[GitHub Issue #1087]
* A Kafka Producer configuration that contains an equals sign `=` in the property value will fail to parse. This was identified in attempting to configure credentials to connect to CloudKarafka.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1107[GitHub Issue #1107], thanks to https://fusionauth.io/community/forum/user/chris-bridges[@chris-bridges] for letting us know!

### Enhancements
* Support a Kickstart file with only a `licenseId`. Previously at least one API key was required because the intent of Kickstart is to call one or more APIs. While there is not a very practical use case for only providing a `licenseId` and no API requests,  this minimal configuration will no longer fail indicating an API key is required. See [Set your License Id](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/kickstart#set-your-license-id) in the [Kickstart](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/kickstart) documentation.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1080[GitHub Issue #1080]
* You may now import an RSA certificate with a key bit length less than `2048` into Key Master. The minimum supported RSA key length for signing a JWT is `2048`, so this was previously the minimum requirement to import anything into Key Master. However, we have several configurations now that require a certificate that is only used to verify a signature from a third party. In these cases, we are not using the certificate to sign anything, and https://github.com/trevorr[@trevorr] rightly pointed out that we should allow smaller keys to be imported to support these use cases. Thank you for the (now obvious) insight! We really appreciate our community members that provide us value for value.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1085[GitHub Issue #1085] & https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1091[GitHub Issue #1091]
* Added an additional Search API parameter to allow you to obtain the actual hit count from Elasticsearch. For performance reasons, the default behavior of an Elasticsearch query is to limit the hit count to 10,000. This means that if your query matched more than 10,000 records, the API response will only indicate that at least 10,000 records matched. This is very adequate for pagination purposes, or general queries. There are times where you are building a very specific query and the intent is to identify an accurate number of matching records. You may now provide an additional parameter to the search request named `accurateTotal` which will then return an accurate hit count on the API response. See the [User Search](/docs/apis/users#search-for-users) API for additional details.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1086[GitHub Issue #1086]
* Allow the user to click on the Enabled column in the Webhook event configuration in the Webhook and Tenant configurations to enable or disable all events at once. This is just a usability enhancement to save you from clicking over and over. You're welcome.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1093[GitHub Issue #1093]
* For pages with potentially a lot of items such as Applications, Tenants, etc - that do not currently have pagination, add a count at the bottom of the panel. This allows you to look smart by knowing how many "things" you have without having to count them yourself.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1104[GitHub Issue #1104]

### Internal
* Some enhancements to JavaScript event handlers to perform better on pages with 2-3k+ applications. Pretty boring.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1105[GitHub Issue #1105]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.23.3" releaseDate="January 21th, 2021" />

### Fixed
* A tenant delete request may fail. See details in the linked GH issue for a work around. This issue was introduced in version 1.22.0.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1075[GitHub Issue #1075]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.23.2" releaseDate="January 20th, 2021" />

### Fixed
* A bug in the PostgreSQL migration will cause you to lose your SAML v2 IdP configuration. If you are using MySQL or you are not using the SAML v2 IdP configuration, this bug will not affect you. The issue was introduced in version 1.21.0, so if you are upgrading from a version prior to 1.21.0 to 1.23.2 you will not be affected. If you have already upgraded to 1.21.0 or any version greater than 1.21.0 prior to this patch, you will have already encountered the issue. If you do encounter this issue, you will need to update the SAML v2 IdP configuration found in each affected Application configuration.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1074[GitHub Issue #1074]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.23.1" releaseDate="January 13th, 2021" />

### Fixed
* When configured to sign the SAML v2 AuthN requests to the SAML v2 IdP, the SAML v2 SP metadata does not correctly reflect this settings. The attribute `AuthnRequestsSigned` should now reflect the signing configuration.
** When configured to sign requests, the SP metadata response will now also contain the KeyDescriptor element to describe the X.509 certificate used to verify the signature.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1067[GitHub Issue #1067]


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.23.0" releaseDate="January 11th, 2021" />

<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

### Known Issues
* If you are upgrading to this version, are using PostgreSQL, and you intend to use the provided LinkedIn Reconcile lambda, you will need to make a small adjustment prior to using it.
** Navigate to <strong>Customizations -> Lambdas</strong> and edit the lambda named `Default LinkedIn Reconcile provided by FusionAuth` and click edit. You will see an error indicated by a red dot on line `23` of the function body. To fix this error, delete the two empty lines between the end of line `23` and `25`, once the error indicator is gone, save the lambda.
* Unable to remove a User from a group using the Admin UI dialog.
** Fixed in version 1.24.0 via https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1081[GitHub Issue #1081]


### Fixed
* A validation error may not be visible when selecting self service registration options when the FusionAuth license has not been activated.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/951[GitHub Issue #951]
* The User Action API was returning a `200` status code instead of a `404` when requesting an action by Id that did not exist.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/991[GitHub Issue #991], thanks to https://github.com/hkolbeck-streem[@hkolbeck-streem] for the report!
* The IP address shown on the About panel may be the same for each node when viewed on a multi-node FusionAuth instance. This address is shown for informational purposes and was only a cosmetic defect w/out any functional issues.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1030[GitHub Issue #1030]
* The SAML Response XML was failing XSD validation for the `Signature` element location when the request was not successful, or FusionAuth was configured to sign the response instead of the assertion.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1047[GitHub Issue #1047], thanks to https://github.com/MrChrisRodriguez[@MrChrisRodriguez] for the excellent report!
* Fix a possible NPE when making an Update request to a group in a multi-tenant environment. With this fix, the correct API response will be returned.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1052[GitHub Issue #1052], thanks to https://github.com/atrauzzi[@atrauzzi] for the report!
* When creating an IdP from the API for Google, Facebook, Twitter, or HYPR - the API was allowing an Id to be provided. Each of these IdP types of which only one are allowed, have a fixed Id that is managed by FusionAuth. The API should ignore the requested Id and set the correct Id instead. If you encounter this issue, the work around is to omit the Id on the API request.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1058[GitHub Issue #1058]
* Kickstart fails when using a variable in the `tenantId` field for an API key.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1060[GitHub Issue #1060], thanks to https://github.com/rhofland[@rhofland] for the report and the excellent recreate steps!

* New FusionAuth roles oriented for Level 1 support personnel. These new roles are named `user_support_viewer` and `user_support_manager`, see FusionAuth application roles for additional detail.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1027[GitHub Issue #1027]

### Enhancements
* Updates to the User and Import API to provide validation on the length of an email address. This will provide a developer a better error when the provided email address is too long.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/900[GitHub Issue #900]

### Client libraries
* Enhancements to the .NET Core client library to better support requests in a multi-tenant environment and to use the `IDictionary` reference instead of `Dictionary`.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1049[GitHub Issue #1049] and https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1050[GitHub Issue #1050], thanks to https://github.com/atrauzzi[@atrauzzi] for sharing his .NET Core expertise!
