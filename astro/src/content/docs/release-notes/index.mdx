<ReleaseNoteHeading version='1.50.1' releaseDate='April 25, 2024' />

### Fixed
* FusionAuth added a First Time Setup wizard in 1.50.0. This release fixes a couple of usability items related to the new wizard.
  * Items related to the first time setup wizard are being show after upgrades, when the intent was to only show them for new installations. These are now only being shown for unconfigured FusionAuth instances.
  * In the First Time Setup summary page, FusionAuth shows sample configuration for various [quickstarts](/docs/quickstarts/). The configuration for the [React quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-javascript-react-web) corresponds to a previous version of the quickstart and is incompatible with the current version. The React quickstart configuration is now formatted for the current quickstart version.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2729](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2729)

<ReleaseNoteHeading version='1.50.0' releaseDate='April 24, 2024' name="Scopes Salamander" />

<GeneralMigrationWarning >
  This release makes significant changes to the default behavior of new Applications with regard to scopes in OAuth workflows.
  The database migration will update existing Applications to behave in a backwards compatible manner.
  See the OAuth [Scopes](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/scopes) documentation for more information, in particular the `Relationship`, `Unknown scope policy`, and `Scope handling policy` configurations.
</GeneralMigrationWarning>

<DeprecationWarning>
  The use of JWT authentication for the `/api/user` API is being deprecated. This functionality will be removed in a future release.

  If you are using this API with JWT authentication, you will need to modify your integration to use the `/oauth2/userinfo` endpoint if you have obtained your JWT using an OAuth2 grant, or authenticate the request to the User API using an API key.

  Removal of this authentication type is targeted for the end of 2024.
</DeprecationWarning>

<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

### Changed
* The `/oauth2/userinfo` endpoint now requires the `aud` claim to be present on the provided access token, allowing for tighter compliance with the OIDC spec. See the [UserInfo endpoint](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/endpoints#userinfo) for more detail.

  If you are not using OAuth, and your JWT does not contain the `aud` claim, consider using the [JWT validate](/docs/apis/jwt#validate-a-jwt) API instead.
  * GitHub issue pending
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2725](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2725)
* Applications now offer an `Unknown Scope Policy`. This can be used to enhance security by rejected or removing unrecognized scopes during an OAuth workflow. See the application [Scopes tab](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/applications#scopes) for more detail.
  * Delivered as part of the Custom OAuth Scopes body of work, which resolves [GitHub Issue #275](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/275) (see below)
* Applications now have a new Scope Handling Policy. The `Strict` option provides behaviors that are more compliant with the OIDC specification, while the `Compatibility` option provides backwards-compatible behavior. Specifically, `Strict` mode limits information in access tokens and populates Id tokens and UserInfo responses based on the requested OAuth scopes. This option also restricts the UserInfo endpoint to accepting only access tokens containing the `openid` scope.

  See [Scope handling policy](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/scopes#scope-handling-policy) for more detail.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1582](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1582) and [GitHub Issue #1475](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1475), thanks to [@awoodobvio](https://github.com/awoodobvio) for the suggestions!
* The [Refresh Token Grant](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/endpoints#refresh-token-grant-request) request now supports requesting a subset of the original scopes. The former behavior was to respond with an `invalid_scope` OAuth error.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2590](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2590)
* Support for optional expansion of the `application.roles` and `application.scopes` properties on the Application Search API.

  This change is backwards compatible, but you may optionally request the Search API omit these properties on the response which may improve performance. See the [Application Search](/docs/apis/applications#search-for-applications) API for additional details on using the `expand` request parameter, and the `expandable` response value.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2724](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2724)
* The `/oauth2/device/user-code` endpoint now returns the `scope` parameter value that should be used in the interactive portion of the Device Code Grant workflow. See [Device User Code](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/endpoints#device-user-code) for more detail.
  * Addressed as part of the Custom OAuth Scopes body of work, which resolves [GitHub Issue #275](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/275) (see below)

### Fixed
* FusionAuth will now limit passwords to 50 characters when using the bcrypt algorithm. This restriction is due to limitations in the bcrypt algorithm. This limit will be enforced even when the tenant policy allows for a maximum password length greater than 50. If the tenant policy requires a maximum password length of less than 50, the tenant policy will take precedence.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2671](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2671)
* There are several scenarios where implicit email verification can occur. They are, during registration verification, password change, passwordless authentication, and MFA code validation. In these cases, a configured email verification email was not being sent, and the email verification event was not being generated. The email and event will both be triggered during implicit verification now.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1651](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1651) and [GitHub Issue #2672](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2672). Thanks to [@ashutoshningot](https://github.com/ashutoshningot) and [@mou](https://github.com/mou), respectively, for the suggestions!
* When configuring MFA for an application, the `Trust policy` selector is not being shown when MFA is required for the application, but only shown when MFA enabled for optional use. The selector is now shown when the `On login policy` is set to either `Enabled` or `Required`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2593](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2593)
* When using FusionAuth behind a proxy, a missing `X-Forwarded-Proto` header could incorrectly cause a warning of a missing `X-Forwarded-Port` header. These warnings are now reported accurately. Additionally, FusionAuth will now be smarter about determining the forwarded port, taking it from one of multiple sources including `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Forwarded-Port`, or inferring it from `X-Forwarded-Proto`. This should make FusionAuth work with more proxies out of the box without additional configuration.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2702](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2702)
* When authentication with an identity provider fails due to misconfiguration, and a user falls back to logging in with a username and password, the `authenticationType` that is reported by FusionAuth is for the original identity provider despite the user having logged in with a username and password. FusionAuth now correctly reports the authentication type as `PASSWORD`. Thanks to [@charlesericjs](https://github.com/charlesericjs) for bringing this to our attention!
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2670](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2670)

### Enhancements
* FusionAuth will now enforce a maximum password length of 256 characters in the tenant password policy. This decision was made to strike a balance between allowing for very secure passwords, but also for maintaining acceptable performance when using a large number of hash iterations.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2688](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2688)

### New
* Custom OAuth scopes are now supported for applications. Custom OAuth scopes come along with a number of related features, including support for third-party applications, themable user consent, and much more.

  See the [API docs](/docs/apis/scopes) and [OAuth Scopes documentation](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/scopes) for more detail.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #275](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/275), thanks to [@badaz](https://github.com/https://github.com/badaz) for the suggestion!
* Applications may now be designated as third-party applications. In addition to the prompting for authorization that comes with the `Custom OAuth Scopes` feature (see above), limitations are being added to how third-party applications may interact with FusionAuth.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2723](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2723)
* Applications can now be configured to prompt users to grant consent to requested OAuth scopes using the `/oauth2/consent` [themed](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/) page. See the OAuth [Scopes](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/scopes) for more detail.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #411](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/411)
* A new lambda function has been introduced that can be used to customize the UserInfo response for an application. See [UserInfo Populate Lambda](/docs/extend/code/lambdas/userinfo-populate) for more detail.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1647](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1647) and [GitHub Issue #659](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/659), thanks to [@themobi](https://github.com/themobi) and [@soullivaneuh](https://github.com/soullivaneuh) for the suggestions!
* A new, optional First Time Setup wizard has been added, which guides a developer through the basic setup needed to integrate their first application. After installing FusionAuth, you'll be able to access this from the main admin dashboard, as well as from the top of the left hand navigation.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2717](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2717)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version='1.49.2' releaseDate='March 20th, 2024' />

### New
* The search index default refresh interval may now be configured. In general this should not be modified, but the configuration option has been added and will default to `1s`. The new configuration is named `fusionauth-app.search.default-refresh-interval`. See the [Configuration](/docs/reference/configuration) reference for additional detail.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2679](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2679)

### Fixed
* When configured to use an email verification strategy of `Form Field` without setting the unverified behavior to `Gated` the verification strategy was always functionally using `Clickable Link` which means the user would receive an email with a clickable URL instead of a short code.

  With this fix, you may now use an unverified behavior of `Allow` with a verification strategy of `Form Field`. When you configure FusionAuth this way, it is assumed that you will be handling the verification process in your own application.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1734](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1734)
* When using the Bulk User Import API `/api/user/import` the search index refresh interval is modified to improve performance. Specifically the index `refresh_interval` is set equal to `-1`. When this API is called in parallel, it is possible that this index setting is not reset and will stay configured as `-1`. The symptom of this error is that changes to the index are not reflected by the Search API and the search results may no longer be accurate.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2679](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2679)
* When Advanced Threat Detection is enabled, an IP location database will be downloaded and used for IP address resolution. For these licensed customers, it is possible that a corrupted IP location database was downloaded and not correctly discarded and as a result the IP address location data may not be available.

  You may have been impacted if you were using version `1.47.0` or later, between February 1st, 2024 and February 23rd, 2024. The observable symptom would be that your license status for the Advanced Threat Detection will show `Pending` instead of `Active`.

  This condition has already been corrected for FusionAuth Cloud. If you are self-hosting FusionAuth, upgrading will correct this condition. If you have a support contract and believe you are currently in this state and are not able to upgrade, please reach out to support for assistance.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2673](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2673)

### Enhancements
* Add email and registration verification Ids to the User and Registration API responses when available for consistency and to better enable out of band management of these verification workflows.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue#2681](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2681)

<ReleaseNoteHeading version='1.49.1' releaseDate='March 6th, 2024' name="Bugfix Beluga"/>

<DatabaseMigrationWarning/>

### Changed
* The Nashorn JavaScript engine has been removed from FusionAuth. All Lambda functions will now use the GraalJS engine which has been available since version `1.35.0`. No action is required, but please note that if you had any Lambda functions still configured to use the Nashorn engine they will be migrated to use GraalJS.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1828](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1828)
* In prior versions of FusionAuth, if a new themed page was added, until you upgraded your theme by adding this new page, the end user may be shown a page indicate the page was missing. This was shown because it was assumed that a new page would only be shown for a new feature that had not been enabled, and this page would only ever been seen during development. In this release we are adding a new page that may be shown w/out any additional features being enabled. For this reason, we have removed this place holder page, and we will always fall back to the default theme when a page is missing. You will still want to upgrade your theme as part of your upgrade process, but this change will ensure that we will not break any new or existing workflows when a new page is added.
   * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2443](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2443)

### Security
* An incorrectly formatted SAML request may cause excessive CPU load.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1681](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1681)
* Disable additional JNDI settings in the LDAP connector. This update is proactive, there are no known exploits.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2605](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2605)
* Add additional protection against cross-site attacks when FusionAuth is acting as a SAML IdP.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2611](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2611)
* Audit log entries added by the FusionAuth admin application may contain sensitive information. Sensitive fields will now be masked when written to the audit log. Please note that this does not affect the Audit Log API, only the use of this API by the FusionAuth admin app.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2623](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2623)
* Added additional protection against cross-site attacks when using the self-service account pages.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2626](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2626)


### Fixed
* The default permissions in AWS RDS PostgreSQL version 15.2 caused the initial configuration of FusionAuth to fail to create the tables required to complete the initial configuration. The required permissions are now being explicitly granted, and the errors reported back to the user have been improved.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2264](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2264)
* If a user starts a Forgot Password flow, and clicks on a change password link in an email after the link has expired, the redirect back to the original Forgot Password form will not include the locale parameter. This fix ensures that a locale parameter, when present in the change password link, is preserved through this workflow and allows for localization to remain consistent.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2328](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2328)
* When setting up a Facebook IdP, an option was provided in the admin UI to select `Use vendor JavaScript` as a Login method. This option is not applicable and has been removed.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2351](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2351)
* Fix the SCIM filter when filtering on `userName eq {username}` to always return a single result.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2455](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2455)
* The LinkedIn APIs have changed, and the LinkedIn IdP no longer worked for new LinkedIn applications. This update allows FusionAuth to work with new and legacy LinkedIn applications.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2496](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2496)
* The FusionAuth TypeScript client library was incorrectly encoding arrays values into query parameters. This bug was preventing a few specific search queries from working correctly.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2513](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2513)
* When using MySQL, the default Admin user form was missing the `First name` field. The field could be added to the form, but was missing in the default version.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2529](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2529)
* When an invalid Tenant Id was provided on the `.well-known/openid-configuration` the default configuration was returned. This has been updated to return a `404` status code.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2538](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2538)
* When creating a User with a group membership with a specified member Id that was already in use, the requested completed w/out a validation error and the membership was ignored. The API now correctly validates this condition and will return a `400` and a JSON response.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2586](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2586)
* When retrieving all refresh tokens for a user, the response may contain the user's SSO token. The SSO token can be identified because it does not contain an `applicationId` and it may not be refreshed. Validation has been improved when using the Refresh Grant, or the Refresh API to ensure FusionAuth correctly fails indicating the token is invalid and may not be refreshed.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2594](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2594)
* A regression was introduced in version `1.47.0` to the Change Password themed page. The issue is that the `passwordValidationRules` variable may be `null` on the first render. If you had been referencing this field in your template, the render may fail.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2616](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2616)
* The Identity Provider Link API states that a `token` parameter can be accepted during a create. When provided, the token was not being persisted on the link.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2622](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2622)
* Fix the "Getting Started" link found in the index page in the default theme.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2625](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2625)
* When viewing a User's Consents in the FusionAuth admin UI, if one or more of the consents have been granted by another user that is not a member of their family, an error is shown in the `Given by` column.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2639](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2639)
* When you have configured the JWT signing key with the `ES512` algorithm, the generated signature may be intermittently invalid. This means that JWTs may seemingly fail to validate randomly and you may think you are crazy. You are not crazy. If you are using this signing algorithm, it is recommended you use a different algorithm until you are able to upgrade.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2661](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2661)
* SCIM PATCH requests may fail to parse if an op path value contains a named schema containing a `.` (dot). This parsing error has been corrected.

  For example: `urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:department`
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2667](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2667)
* When an SCIM create or update request contains schemas for which no properties exist, subsequent PATCH requests to those schema namespaces may fail.

  For example, if the initial request contains a schema `urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User` without any properties, the default lambda function used to map this request to FusionAuth was not persisting this schema namespace. Then a subsequent PATCH request to add a member to that namespace such as `urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:department` would fail.

  The default SCIM request converter (Lambda function) has been updated to correct this behavior.

  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2667](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2667)

### Enhancements
* Link checkers are great. They aim to protect end users from malicious links and phishing attacks. However, they wreak havoc and pain on identity providers using email based workflows to complete passwordless login, or email verification. And FusionAuth is one of those identity providers!

  FusionAuth has employed various tactics over the years to stay ahead of the techniques used by these 3rd party tools. Their techniques continue to evolve making it difficult or impossible to know the difference between a link checker and a real human interacting with the link.

  A new confirmation page has been added that is intended to protect the user, and make our email workflows immune to link checkers.

  For example, when a user initiates a request such as passwordless login, and then completes the request in the same browser, the user will not observe any change. If the user completes the request on a different browser, or completes a request they did not initiate - such as clicking on an email verification link sent when a use is provisioned by an administrator, the user will be prompted to confirm they wish to complete the request.

  If you are using a custom theme, you will want to upgrade your theme to include this new page. Until you complete this upgrade, the default theme will be used for this new page. In the FusionAuth admin UI, the theme page will be named *Confirmation required*.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2443](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2443)
* Ensure the Login API never fails validation due to a timing issue with an Application cache. This rarely affects runtime, but this can be useful for testing where you may create an application and immediately perform a login.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2557](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2557)
* Add a trusted proxy configuration to the System Configuration. This new configuration allows you to define one or more trusted upstream proxies using an IP address, or range of addresses using a CIDR notation.

  A client IP address will be captured in a login record, sent to webhooks, and used to provide access when IP ACLs are configured. To correctly resolve the client IP address, we often will need to use the `X-Forwarded-For` request header.

  This header is modified when it passes through a proxy. In order to trust the contents of this header and resolve the client IP address, FusionAuth must know if it can trust all proxies implicitly, or to only trust those that are explicitly configured as trusted. The change is to optionally configure FusionAuth to no longer trust any upstream proxy that is not explicitly configured as trusted.

  This new configuration can be found in the FusionAuth admin UI by navigating to `Settings > System > Networking`, or on the System Configuration API.

  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2624](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2624)

### Internal
* Update 3rd party dependencies.
  * Upgrade `org.postgresql:postgresql` `42.6.0` to `42.7.2`
  * Upgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson` `2.15.2` to `2.15.3`
  * Upgrade `org.mybatis:mybatis` `3.5.13` to `3.5.15`
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2534](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2534)
* During a reindex operation, log the progress based upon a fixed time interval instead of every 250k records. This ensures the output is predictable regardless of the reindex performance.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2565](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2565)

<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.48.3" releaseDate="December 6th, 2023" />

### Fixed
* Update the refresh token TTL when using the sliding window with a maximum lifetime JWT Expiration Policy. The symptom of this bug is that a refresh token will expire before the maximum configured lifetime.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2566](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2566)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.48.2" releaseDate="November 21st, 2023" />

### Fixed
* When paging beyond 10,000 in the FusionAuth admin UI for Users or Entities, the bottom set of pagination controls may not work. If you encounter an error when clicking on the pagination controls, use the top set of controls instead. This bug is specific to the new pagination introduced in version `1.48.0`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2544](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2544)
* In some cases when using with FusionAuth-hosted pages in an non-secure context, such as accessing FusionAuth on `localhost`, the `PublicKeyCredential` JavaScript API will not be available. This may cause an error on your JavaScript console `PublicKeyCredential is not defined`. This error kept the form on the page from correctly submitting.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2500](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2500)
* In version `1.48.0` a change was made to reject a link request from an OpenID Connect IdP when the `email_verified` claim is supplied with a value of `false`. An assumption was made that the `email` and `email_verified` claims would both be present in the `Userinfo` response or the `id_token`. Some providers may split these claims, so this assumption has been removed.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2542](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2542)

### Security
* Correct the validation of the `post_logout_redirect_uri` parameter on the OAuth2 Logout request for relative URIs intended for use for FusionAuth applications.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2539](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2539)

### Internal
* Improve our JWT validation for internal security schemes by failing faster on invalid tokens.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2555](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2555)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.48.1" releaseDate="October 29th, 2023" />

<DatabaseMigrationWarning/>

### Fixed
* A bug was identified in a change made in version `1.48.0` that may affect performance for those with > 1M users.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2535](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2535)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.48.0" releaseDate="October 27th, 2023" name="Webhook Walrus" />

<DatabaseMigrationWarning/>

### Known Issues
* A bug was identified in a change made in this version that may affect performance for those with > 1M users.
  * Resolved in version `1.48.1` via  [GitHub Issue #2535](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2535)

### Changed
* We are officially announcing the end of life for the Nashorn JavaScript engine used by FusionAuth Lambda functions. All new functions have defaulted to the GraalJS since version `1.35.0`. The engine is not being removed in the release, but this is an official notice that we plan to remove this engine in early 2024. Please review your lambda functions and ensure the `engineType` is set to `GraalJS`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1828](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1828)
* We are officially announcing the end of life for the `fusionauth-search` package. This is currently available in a `.deb`, `.rpm` and `.zip` bundle for various platforms. This package is still available, but the plan is to stop building this at the end of 2023. Please make plans to discontinue use of the `fusionauth-search` package if you are currently using it.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2532](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2532)
* When the OpenID Connect or External JWT Identity Provider is configured to Link by Email and the IdP returns a claim named `email_verified` and the value is `false`, the link request will be rejected. This change is intended to reduce the risk of linking on an un-verified email address.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2423](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2423)

### Security
* When an IdP is configured to Link by Email or Link by Username and a user already exists with this email or username respectively, perform additional validation to ensure the user does not already have an existing link to the current Identity Provider. This only affects IdP that allow for one to many tenants to be accessed through a single IdP configuration. In practice this means that the IdP cannot guarantee that an email address is considered globally unique and only assigned to a single user.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2512](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2512)
* A bug was identified in the `multipart/form-data` parser that may cause elevated CPU usage in some specific cases.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2385](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2385)

### Fixed
* Enhance the widget used in multi-value select controls to accept a value when pasting. For example, you may now paste a value from the clipboard directly into the `Authorized redirect URLs` field. While previously the paste operation worked, the user would have to click the value to confirm. If you clicked off of the field, the value would not be saved.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1784](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1784)
* Correct the error message when a user has enabled MFA and a webhook returns a non-200 status code for the `user.login.success` event. The message will now correctly indicate the webhook has failed instead of the previously incorrect error indicating an invalid token was used.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1955](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1955)
* When viewing an Email Template in the FusionAuth admin UI, two dialogs open instead of one. This was the result of two event handlers being bound instead of one.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2304](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2304)
* When using the asynchronous tenant delete, it is possible for the delete job to fail if the system is under heavy load. When this occurs the delete job status may not be correctly updated and you are stuck in a `Deleting` state. The asynchronous job processor has been enhanced to account for this potential failure condition so the job can be correctly restarted if necessary.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2307](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2307)
* Correct a potential race condition that could cause a request to the `/.well-known/jwks.json` endpoint to exception and return a `500` status code when under heavy load.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2390](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2390)
* The Lambda metrics introduced in version `1.47.0` may not always correctly increment the failed count when a lambda invocation failed. This affects the `lambda.[*].failures` and `lambda.[{webhookId}].failures` metric names.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2408](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2408)
* When using the `PATCH` method on the Tenant API, if you previously had any explicit webhooks configured for this tenant, the association between the tenant and the webhook was lost. If you are not using webhooks, or all of your webhooks are configured for `All tenants` (`webhook.global`), this bug would not affect you.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2411](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2411)
* Improve the validation for the Entity API to correctly validate the `type.id` value. Because this value was not being correctly validated, it means the API caller may receive a `500` status code instead of a `400` with a developer friendly JSON response body to indicate how the input can be corrected.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2412](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2412)
* A critical bug was identified that caused FusionAuth to incorrectly identify users eligible for deletion based upon the tenant policy to delete users with an unverified email address. Until you have upgraded to version `1.48.0` please disable `Delete unverified users` if you currently have enabled `Email verification`, `Verify email when changed` and `Delete unverified users`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2441](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2441)
* A bug was identified that affected several APIs when using the `PATCH` method with fields that require custom deserializers in FusionAuth. Affected APIs included Application, Connector, Message Template and Identity Provider. The symptom you will observe is a failed request with a `500` status code.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2454](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2454)
* When using PostgreSQL, under heavy load, a potential deadlock conditions exists when attempting to write login metrics to the database. MySQL database was not affected by this bug. If you were to encounter this bug you may observe some exceptions in the log related to the LoginQueue.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2465](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2465)
* Fix a JavaScript error that was preventing Audit Log searches by user from returning results.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2470](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2470)
* Resolve an issue where users could not enable two-factor authentication during authentication when they were not registered for the application. Thanks to [@wproffitt-elder](https://github.com/wproffitt-elder) for reporting!
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2474](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2474)
* When using the Refresh Token API, un-expired SSO sessions may be incorrectly omitted from the API response. The result of this bug is that an active SSO session may not be displayed in the FusionAuth admin UI. This has now been corrected, and the FusionAuth admin UI and the Refresh Token API will correctly return all valid SSO sessions.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2489](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2489)
* If the `search.servers` configuration value was not added to the `fusionauth.properties` configuration file, and you omit the `SEARCH_SERVERS` environment value, FusionAuth would fail to start. The correct behavior is for FusionAuth to default to `http://localhost:9021`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2507](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2507)

### Enhancements
* Enhance the User and Entity Search APIs to paginate beyond 10,000 results. The Search API response will now include a `nextResults` value that can be used to ask for the next set of search results which enables the API to paginate through the entire available result set.
  * See the [Entity Search APIs](/docs/apis/entities/entities#search-for-entities) and [User Search APIs](/docs/apis/users#search-for-users) for API details.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #494](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/494)
* When using the Webhook test action in the FusionAuth admin UI, additional information will now be returned if the webhook returns a non-200 status code. This should make it simpler to debug your webhook integration. Prior to this change, the response would only indicate if the response was successful or not.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #793](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/793)
* When using the Webhook test action in the UI, changes to the example request body were not preserved. Changes will now be preserved across send requests for the browser session. This means a test can be run repeatedly without having to perform the same edits to the default event request body.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #797](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/797)
* Support specifying webhook SSL certificates from Key Master. Prior to this enhancement, if you needed to specify an SSL certificate, it had to be added to the webhook in PEM format. You may now store this certificate in Key Master and then use this same certificate between webhooks.<br/>This change is backwards compatible, but the ability to manually specify X.509 certificates in PEM format on the webhook configuration has been deprecated and may be removed in the future. See the [Webhook](/docs/apis/webhooks) API `sslCertificateKeyId` field for additional details.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #883](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/883)
* Modal dialogs in the FusionAuth admin UI can now be closed by using the escape key or by clicking outside of the modal.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #903](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/903)
* Add support for signing webhook events with a SHA-256 hash function. This feature will allow consumers of FusionAuth events to verify the message body has not been modified. The signature is contained in a JWT and will be sent using an HTTP request header named `X-FusionAuth-Signature-JWT`. You may use existing JWT verification strategies including consuming the public key from the JWKS endpoint.
  * See the [Signing Webhooks](/docs/extend/events-and-webhooks/signing) and [Webhooks APIs](/docs/apis/webhooks) for signing and verification details.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1859](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1859)
* Expose the `id_token` returned by the Identity Provider to the Reconcile Lambda function when available. If the `id_token` is returned by the IdP and the signature can be verified it will be now be passed to the lambda function in the `tokens` argument. Example: `tokens.id_token`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2189](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2189)
* Add the `curl` command to the FusionAuth Docker image. This allows you to use the `curl` command for use in health checks or anytime you need to use `curl`!
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2272](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2272)
* Support for optional expansion of the `user.registrations` and `user.memberships` properties on the User Search API.<br/>This change is backwards compatible, but you may optionally request the Search API omit these properties on the response which may improve performance. See the [User Search](/docs/apis/users#search-for-users) API for additional details on using the `expand` request parameter, and the `expandable` response value.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2319](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2319)
* Enhance the error messaging returned to the end user when using the Test SMTP button in the FusionAuth admin UI. This enhancement will make it easier to test your SMTP configuration.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2373](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2373)
* Reduce un-necessary logging when fuzzers send parameter names containing `class`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2393](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2393)
* When updating a theme, a validation error will be returned if you are missing messages. Currently the error response does include the missing message keys. This error response is now enhanced to return the keys and the default values from the default theme. This allows you to optionally parse the response for the missing keys and values.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2427](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2427)
* Expose the `access_token` returned by the Identity Provider to the Reconcile Lambda function. The `access_token` will now be passed to the lambda function in the `tokens` argument. Example: `tokens.access_token`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2494](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2494)
* When the `id_token` is returned from the IdP and the signature can be verified it will now be used to optionally resolve the `uniqueIdClaim` in addition to the `emailClaim` and `usernameClaim`. This means you can configure the `uniqueIdClaim` to a claim that is only available in the `id_token`. Prior to this change, the `id_token` could only be verified if it was signed using the an HMAC algorithm using the `client_secret`. With this change, if the IdP publishes public keys using the JWKS endpoint that is resolved from the `.well-known/openid-configuration` FusionAuth will attempt to validate the signature.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2501](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2501)

<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.47.1" releaseDate="July 27th, 2023" />

### Fixed
* Revert the GC (garbage collection) logging change introduced in version `1.47.0` for compatibility with the FusionAuth docker image.
 * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2392](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2392), thanks to [@pigletto](https://github.com/pigletto) and [@patricknwn](https://github.com/patricknwn) for reporting.


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.47.0" releaseDate="July 25th, 2023" name="Performance Panther" />

<GeneralMigrationWarning >
Please be sure to read the notes in the **Changed** section before upgrading.
</GeneralMigrationWarning>

<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

### Known Issues
* The garbage collection logging change introduced in version `1.47.0` was not compatible with the way the FusionAuth docker image was built. You will need to use version `1.47.1` if you will be using the FusionAuth docker image.
  * Resolved in version `1.47.1` via [GitHub Issue #2392](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2392)
* The `passwordValidationRules` variable may be `null` on the first render of the Change Password themed page. If you had been referencing this field in your template, the render may fail.
  * Resolved in version `1.49.1` via [GitHub Issue #2616](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2616)

### Security
* A race condition exists when using a refresh token with a one-time-use policy where the same token value could successfully be used twice to obtain a new access token. In practice this would be very difficult to replicate outside of a scripted example.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1840](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1840) Thanks to [@avitsrimer](https://github.com/avitsrimer) for reporting the issue!
* Use a CSRF token with all federated login requests. This change will add additional protection when using a federated login to ensure the login is completed from the same browser that started the login workflow. This mitigates an attack vector that can be used in phishing attacks where a victim could be convinced to click on a link that would cause the user to unknowingly complete a login.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2238](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2238)

### Changed
* A change was made to the OAuth2 origin validation code. This change is not expected to cause any change in behavior for anyone with configured Authorized Origin URLs. The change is to inspect the port in addition to the schema and host when comparing the request and the `Referer` or `Host` header to determine if the request has originated from FusionAuth. One possible edge case that could be affected is if you using `localhost` in development for both FusionAuth and another application. In this example, it is possible that FusionAuth was not validating the Origin of requests from your application running on `localhost` correctly. If you encounter this case, you can either remove all Authorized Origin URLs from your configuration, or add the origin of your application so that it can be correctly validated.
* Due to the necessary change related to adding a CSRF token when performing a federated login, a manual change may be required to your themed login pages. Please read through these details to understand if you will be affected.<br/>If you are using any 3rd party IdP configurations such as OpenID Connect, SAML v2, Google, Facebook with a custom theme, you will need to make a modification to your template in order for federated login to continue to work correctly.<br/>If you are not using any 3rd party IdP configurations, or you are not using a custom theme, no change will be necessary.<br/>If you will be affected by this change, please review the following details and then make the update to your theme as part of your upgrade process.

1. Find the `alternativeLogins` macro usage in `oauth2Authorize` and `oauth2Register` and add `federatedCSRFToken=federatedCSRFToken` as the last argument to this macro.

```html
[#-- Updated macro usage. Line breaks added for readability. --]
[@helpers.alternativeLogins clientId=client_id
                            identityProviders=identityProviders
                            passwordlessEnabled=passwordlessEnabled
                            bootstrapWebauthnEnabled=bootstrapWebauthnEnabled
                            idpRedirectState=idpRedirectState
                            federatedCSRFToken=federatedCSRFToken/]
```

2. Find the macro named `alternativeLogins` in `helpers` and add `federatedCSRFToken=""` as the last argument to this macro.

```html
[#-- Updated macro in helpers. Line breaks added for readability. --]
[#macro alternativeLogins clientId
                          identityProviders
                          passwordlessEnabled
                          bootstrapWebauthnEnabled=false
                          idpRedirectState=""
                          federatedCSRFToken=""]
```

3.  Find the element `<div class="login-button-container">` in the macro named `alternativeLogins` in `helpers` and add `id="login-button-container"` and `data-federated-csrf="${federatedCSRFToken}"` attributes.

```html
[#-- Updated div in alternativeLogins macro. Line breaks added for readability. --]
<div id="login-button-container"
     class="login-button-container"
     data-federated-csrf="${federatedCSRFToken}">
```

### Fixed
* Ensure a signed AuthN request always has the `Signature` element as the next sibling after the `Issuer` element. This bug may cause some SAML v2 services provides to reject the signature of an AuthN request sent from FusionAuth.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2348](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2348)
* Upgrade our phone number validation to include the Kosovo country code of `+383`. This upgrade will add support for various other country codes as well. See linked GitHub issue for more detail.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2355](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2355)
* Defend against corporate link "checkers" such as Outlook Safe Links and Google Workspace during the Change Password email workflow. This fix resolves a specific symptom that may occur when a link sent to a user during a change password workflow and the user has multi-factor authentication enabled. The symptom the end user may encounter is that multiple codes may be sent to the user during this workflow. When the two-factor method is email, multiple emails may be received, and when two-factor method is SMS, multiple SMS messages may be received. The cause of this symptom is that the link is being inspected by an intermediate party prior to the user's browser loading the link which functionally means the request is made more than once.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2360](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2360)
* Improve locale validation, and restrict the number of preferred languages per user to 20. This should not have any practical impact on users of FusionAuth, but it will better protect FusionAuth from storing erroneous values for the user's preferred languages. If you have users that speak more than 20 languages, you will need to ask them to pick their top 20 favorites. 😎
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2363](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2363)
* Improve username validation. This length limitation was already enforced by the schema, but the error message was not developer friendly. This change will add a proper validation error in the API response.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2368](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2368)
* Update the Tenant view dialog in the admin UI to reflect the changes made to the `/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint in version `1.46.0`. This is a cosmetic change only, and does not include any functional fixes.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2333](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2333)
* Fix Tenant select control on Group index page in the admin UI when only a single tenant is configured. This is just a cosmetic fix to how the form was being rendered.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2338](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2338)
* Reduce Kafka logging. So noisy.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2359](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2359)
* Protect the Kafka event sender from sending events related to it's own failure. This protects us from overloading the Kafka topic.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2362](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2362)
* Fix the `user.registration.update.complete` event to include the updates roles if applicable.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1898](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1898), thanks to [@sjswami](https://github.com/sjswami) for reporting the issue!
* Better defense against a truncated `oauth_context` request parameter. This parameter is passed around during various OAuth2 workflows to maintain context. This changes allows FusionAuth to fail more gracefully if this is value is intentionally or un-intentionally modified by a 3rd party.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2382](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2382)

### Enhancements
* Add `user.preferredLanguages` to the basic self-service registration to allow a user's preferred language to be collected and then utilized to send localized emails without using advanced self-service registration.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1738](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1738), thanks to [@glen-84](https://github.com/glen-84) and [@geoalexidis](https://github.com/geoalexidis) for their input and patience while we delivered this enhancement.
* Improve handling of cache reload requests under heavy load. This should improve system performance at scale when mass creating or deleting of various items such as applications and keys.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2318](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2318)
* Add timers and metrics around lambda invocations and the use of HTTP Connect within a lambda function. This should help customers tune and manage lambdas by providing additional insight into the total execution time.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2389](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2389)
* Add configuration to accept any named parameter as a login hint coming from the SAML v2 SP when FusionAuth is acting as the SAML v2 IdP. Prior to this change, FusionAuth would accept `login_hint` if provided on the request. However, this value can not be configured or optionally disabled.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2222](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2222)
* Add `identityProviderName` to the IdP Link API response.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2337](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2337)

### New
* Support SAML v2 assertion encryption when FusionAuth is acting as the SAML v2 IdP. This means FusionAuth is now compatible with a SAML v2 SP that requires encrypted assertions.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1741](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1741), thanks [@annismckenzie](https://github.com/annismckenzie) for the request! This is a great addition to FusionAuth.

### Internal
* Add aggregate HTTP request timers and metrics that can be retrieved by the Status API and Prometheus Metrics API.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2369](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2369)
* Update 3rd party dependencies.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2344](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2344)
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2384](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2384)
* Enable GC (garbage collection) logging. A new log named `fusionauth-app.gc.log` will be found in the log directory.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2388](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2388)
* Improve performance and overhead when downloading and storing the IP location database required for resolving location meta-data for logins by IP address.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2195](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2195)

  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2227](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2227), thanks to [@beezerk23](https://github.com/beezerk23) for letting us know!
* The memory value for `fusionauth-app.memory` set in the `fusionauth.properties` file may not be set correctly.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2284](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2284)
* When using custom data with nested values such as `user.data.company.name` and `user.data.company.id` in an Advanced Registration form the nested values may not be properly persisted.

  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2233](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2233)
* Correct the internal authentication to receive an internal webhook between FusionAuth service nodes. If you encounter this error, you may see errors in the event log that mention `returned response code [401] when sending [JWTRefreshTokenRevoke] event`. This error was introduced in version `1.37.0` and the error only occurs when you have more than one FusionAuth service node.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2257](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2257)
* When you have enabled Implicit Email Verification, when completing a Multi-Factor login, a `user.email.verified` event may be sent even if the user has already verified their email address.

  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2287](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2287)
* When using the Device Grant with the `/oauth2/device` themed page, you may be shown a Logout button if an SSO session exists during this workflow. Clicking this button will log the user out of the SSO session and return to this page. This fixes the logout link so that you do not receive an error when returning to the `/oauth2/device` page. A workaround is documented in the linked GitHub issue.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2331](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2331)

### Enhancements
* The OAuth2 Introspect endpoint now optionally takes a `client_secret`.

<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.45.4" releaseDate="July 25th, 2023" />

### Fixed
* Ensure we correctly handle a truncated or malformed `oauth_context` request parameter when using the hosted login pages.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2382](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2382)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.45.3" releaseDate="May 31st, 2023" />

### Fixed
* Update `fusionauth/java-http` to the most recent version to pick up a bug fix.

  This fixes a very low level HTTP server bug. In some rare cases, the HTTP response handler may not identify the end of the stream and effectively truncate the response body. It is difficult to say how may affect your integration if you were to encounter it. If you were to make an API call with a large response body, it may be possible the response would not include a valid JSON object if the response is truncated. When this error occurs, the HTTP status code will be valid, but the response will be truncated or non-existent.
  For additional detail see the linked commit in the linked GitHub issue.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2292](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2292)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.45.2" releaseDate="May 8th, 2023" />

<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

### Fixed
* If you have configured an access token signing key specific to an entity type, the signing key configuration may revert to the tenant configuration after upgrading to this version.

  It is recommended to upgrade to this version at a minimum if you are coming from a version prior to version `1.45.0`.
  * For more information on this issue, see the Known Issues in the `1.45.0` release notes.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2249](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2249)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.45.1" releaseDate="April 14th, 2023" />

### Changed
* Add additional validation when adding authorized origin to the OAuth2 configuration to ensure the values do not include a path or query string. This change will only affect validation when adding or editing the application configuration. This change will not affect existing configured origins or their use at runtime.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2185](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2185)

### Fixed
* Support for wildcard configuration when using `post_logout_redirect_uri` parameter on the OAuth2 Logout request.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2164](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2164)
* Fix salt validation for the `phpass-md5` or `phpass-sha512`. This will allow the import of users with this password hash when the salt includes a `.` (period) character.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2206](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2206)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.45.0" releaseDate="April 10th, 2023" />

### Known Issues
* When importing users using the `phpass-md5` or `phpass-sha512` schemes shipped in this release, if the salt contains a period (`.`) the import will fail validation.
  * Resolved in version `1.45.1` via [GitHub Issue #2206](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2206)
* If you have configured an access token signing key specific to an entity type, the signing key configuration may revert to the tenant configuration after upgrading to this version.

  If you wish to upgrade before a fix is available, please document your access token signing key configuration for each entity type that has provided a specific signing configuration. Then, once the upgrade has completed, review each entity type and confirm the correct signing key configuration. If the configuration is not correct, set the signing key to the previously documented signing key.

  To verify if this issue may affect you during upgrade, confirm your signing configuration for each configured entity type.

     * Navigate to <strong>Entity Management -> Entity Types -> Edit -> JWT</strong>.
     * If you have not enabled Entity Type specific JWT signing, this section will be collapsed and this entity type will not be affected during upgrade. If the signing configuration is enabled and you have configured a key for the `Access token signing key` field, you may be affected. Please record this setting and ensure it has not changed after the upgrade has completed.

  If you have not yet upgraded to version `1.45.0`, it is recommended to move to version `1.45.2` or later at a minimum and skip this version if you have confirmed you may be affected by this issue.

  * Resolved in `1.45.2` via [GitHub Issue #2249](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2249)

### Security
* Update usage of `verificationId` on gated email or registration verification pages when configured to use a clickable link instead of a short code.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2182](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2182)
* Update 3rd party dependencies to remove CVE scan warnings. No known exploits are vulnerabilities exist in FusionAuth as the result of using these 3rd party clients. These upgrades are simply a precautionary measure to stay current.
  * Upgrade Elasticsearch client from version `7.10.2` to `7.13.4`.
  * Upgrade GraalJS from version `22.3.0` to `22.3.1`.

* Updates to the OpenAPI spec to correct an error related to `BaseSAMLv2IdentityProvider`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2103](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2103)
* Review and correct tooltips in the admin UI for Application specific email templates.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2163](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2163)

### Enhancements
* De-couple the self-service themed account pages from SSO. You may now use the self-service account pages even if you choose not to preserve your SSO session. For example, you can un-check the "Keep me signed in" checkbox and still use the self-service pages.

  Also allow the self-service account session to be bootstrapped from a mobile application using token authentication, also known as the `Bearer` authentication scheme. This mechanism provides access to the self-service themed pages even if you are unable to share cookies with the web view used to complete login.

  Example request header: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`

  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1546](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1546), thanks to [@ansonallard](https://github.com/ansonallard) for the suggestion!
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1860](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1860)

### New
* Add a policy to require a user to provide their current password when changing a password on the self-service account pages. See <strong>Applications -> Edit -> Registration -> Form settings -> Require current password</strong>.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1578](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1578)
* Integrate the Authorization Code grant workflow into FusionAuth for use with single page web applications. This feature may be used with the FusionAuth React or Angular SDKs to support the use of the Authorization Code grant without having to write any backend code.

  And there was much rejoicing. 😅

  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1943](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1943)
* New Search APIs. These new APIs provide search and pagination capability across more APIs and may increase performance when using the FusionAuth admin UI with larger numbers of Tenants and Applications.

  Applications, Consents, Groups, Tenants, Themes, Keys, API keys, User Comments, Email Templates, Identity Providers, Webhooks, and Lambdas. (🦁 🐯 🐻 ... oh my!)

<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.44.0" releaseDate="March 13th, 2023" />

*Additional details* \
This migration will add an index to the `identity_provider_links` table. It is not expected to negatively impact the migration time during upgrade, but please be aware that deployments with millions of Identity Provider Links may experience additional processing time during the migration.]
<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

### Fixed
* A Lambda invocation may incorrectly fail indicating a recursive call was attempted. This is unlikely to occur, but under heavy load, it is possible.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2102](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2102)
* The Application API was failing to make a copy when using `sourceApplicationId` when the source Application has enabled and configured the SAML v2 IdP. This is a bug in a new feature that was added in version `1.43.0`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2118](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2118)

### Enhancements
* Add default configuration for read and connect timeouts to the SMTP server configuration. This helps protect FusionAuth against an SMTP server that never closes a socket. From time to time we observed an SMTP server hold open a socket, and tie up a send thread which may block other senders.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1742](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1742)
* Change Link API request body to match the response. Backwards compatibility is maintained, but this provides a more consistent API feel.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1747](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1747)
* Update the Google IdP JavaScript in the themed pages. This change removes the deprecated Google JavaScript library, and adds support for One Tap.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1939](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1939), thanks to [@Brunom50](https://github.com/Brunom50), [@harishreddy-m](https://github.com/harishreddy-m), [@forteilgmbh](https://github.com/forteilgmbh) for their contribution.
* Return a `404` with status only for anything under `/api/*` instead of rendering a `404` page with HTML. It just seems like the right thing to do. Nobody wants HTML in their APIs!
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2109](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2109)
* Add a new index to the `identity_provider_links` table to increase performance. Better. Faster. Stronger.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2122](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2122)
{/* // */}
* Add `apiMode: [Public|Partner]` to allow the user to select between the public or partner Steam API. The Partner API is preferred if you have access to it because it is not rate limited.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2127](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2127)
{/* // */}

### Internal
* Use `Cache-Control: no-store` more broadly in the FusionAuth admin application.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2097](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2097)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.43.2" releaseDate="July 9th, 2023" />

### Changed
* The User and User Registration APIs will now restrict `user.preferredLanguages` and `registration.preferredLanguages` to a maximum of `20` values. Additionally each value can be no longer than `24` characters. This change is not expected to impact any existing integrations. Do let us know if you have a use case that is not compatible with this change.

### Fixed
* When an event fails to be sent to a Kafka topic, do not attempt to send an `event-log.create` event that results from the failed request.
  Correct an edge case that exists where an `event-log.create` event fails to be sent to a Kafka topic, and this error causes another `event-log.create` event to be triggered.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2362](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2362)
* Limit the length of a valid value for `user.preferredLanguages` and `registration.preferredLanguages` to a maximum of `24` characters, and restrict the total number of values to `20` or less.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2363](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2363)

### Internal
* Reduce Kafka logging to make it much less noisy at runtime
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2359](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2359)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.43.1" releaseDate="March 6th, 2023" />

### Fixed
* Correct a potential FreeMarker render error caused by a missing CSRF token when performing an SAML v2 IdP initiated login to the FusionAuth admin UI. This error is a side effect of the caller not requesting the `scope=offline_access` parameter. With this fix, you should no longer encounter the error, and the `offline_access` scope is now optional on the request. A workaround is to request the `offline_access` scope.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2125](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2125)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.43.0" releaseDate="February 15th, 2023" />

<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

### Known Issues
* Creating a new application from another application with `sourceApplicationId` returns a `500` error when the source application has SAML v2 enabled and configured.  If you have not configured SAML v2, you will not be affected by this issue.  Workaround is to call Create Application API without the `sourceApplicationId` parameter and supply all the parameters copied from the source application.
  * Resolved in `1.44.0` via [GitHub Issue #2118](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2118).

### Fixed
* Support importing an x.509 certificate with a private key into KeyMaster in the admin UI.

  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1809](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1809), thanks to one of our MVPs [@epbensimpson](https://github.com/epbensimpson) for letting us know.
* The Change Password API was incorrectly failing indicating a Trust Token was required even when provided if the user has MFA enabled.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1909](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1909), thanks to [@timyourivh](https://github.com/timyourivh) for the report!
* Ensure that we correctly terminate an SSO session when beginning a new passwordless login flow with a different user in the same browser.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1912](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1912)

* An error may occur when logging into the FusionAuth admin UI with an IdP initiated request from a SAML v2 IdP and then navigating to your own profile page.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1976](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1976), thanks to [@jon-at-advarra](https://github.com/jon-at-advarra), this was a great edge case.
* When taking a User Action, the duration is localized for the event. The localization is only available for a fixed number of locales. When an un-supported locale, such as Serbian is requested, an exception will occur. This has been fixed to avoid the exception, and if an un-supported Locale is requested, English will be used as the default.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1978](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1978)
* When sending a test event to verify the Kafka configuration, the topic was not being validated as required.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1985](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1985), thanks to [@sixhobbits](https://github.com/sixhobbits), nice catch!

  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1735](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1735), thanks to [@epbensimpson](https://github.com/epbensimpson) for the suggestion.
* Provide better developer feedback on the Change Password API when using an API key.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1897](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1897), thanks to [@sujkattimani](https://github.com/sujkattimani) for the feedback!
* Allow the SAML v2 IdP to be used for both SP and IdP initiated login. Previously to utilize SP and IdP initiated login for the same SAML v2 IdP, you would have to create two separate configurations. It is still recommended to use the separate SAML v2 IdP initiated configuration if you will not be using an SP initiated login.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1900](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1900), thanks to [@leesmith110](https://github.com/leesmith110) for opening the issue and providing us so much valuable feedback.

<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.42.1" releaseDate="January 8th, 2023" />

### Fixed
* A regression error in version `1.42.0` may cause a user to no longer be able to login after a successful login. In order to encounter this bug, you must have your tenant configured to re-hash passwords on login, and have a user login when their password encryption scheme or factor that does not match the configured tenant defaults. If you may have this type of configuration, please do not upgrade to version `1.42.0` and instead upgrade directly to this version.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #2043](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2043)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.42.0" releaseDate="December 7th, 2022" />

### Known Issues
* In this release, you may now create a policy to allow a user to unlock their account after too many failed login attempts by completing a forgot password workflow. A bug was identified in this new feature that may cause this workflow to fail if the user also has 2FA enabled.
  * Resolved in `1.43.0` via [GitHub Issue #2032](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2032)
* An error was introduced that may, after one successful login, cause subsequent logins to fail for a user. In order to encounter this bug, you must have your tenant configured to re-hash passwords on login, and have a user login when their password encryption scheme or factor that does not match the configured tenant defaults. If you may have this type of configuration, please do not upgrade to version `1.42.0` and instead upgrade directly to version `1.42.1`.
  * Resolved in `1.42.1` via [GitHub Issue #2043](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/2043)

### Changed
* When building a WebAuthn credential, the user's current email address or username will now be used as the credential name. Previously this value was generated to be unique to help the user identify multiple credentials. However, Safari on macOS and Edge on Windows may display this value to the end user, so this will no longer be generated but set to a value the user should recognize.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1929](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1929)
* New themed templates for enabling two-factor authentication during login. Please review your themes to ensure the new templates and localized messages are added.

  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1883](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1883)
* Remove SCIM endpoints from the API key configuration in the admin UI, these endpoints do not use API keys.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1987](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1987)
* Fix various rendering issues with the Theme preview in the admin UI
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1755](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1755), thanks to [Steve-MP](https://github.com/Steve-MP) for reporting!

### Enhancements
* Allow a user to unlock their account after being locked due to too many failed authentication attempts by completing a password reset workflow. See the `Cancel action on password reset` in the Tenant configuration. `Tenants > Edit > Password > Failed authentication settings`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #383](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/383), thanks [@colingm](https://github.com/colingm) for the request, and [@davidmw](https://github.com/davidmw) and [@Jlintonjr](https://github.com/Jlintonjr) for the advice and feedback!

### New
* Additional Multi-Factor policy option to require a user to enable multi-factor during login if not yet configured. See `Tenants > Edit > MFA > Policies > On login > Required.`. Application specific configuration can also be configured, see `Applications > Edit > MFA > Policies > On login > Required.`, using the application configuration requires an Enterprise plan.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #197](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/197)
* Allow refresh tokens to be revoked for a user when enabling two-factor authentication. See `Tenants > Edit > JWT > Refresh token settings > Refresh token revocation > On multi-factor enable`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1794](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1794)
* A new lambda function can be assigned to perform custom validation for any step during a self-service registration. This feature is only available when using a custom form, and is not available when using basic self-service registration. This may be useful to perform advanced field validation, or to call a 3rd party API to perform additional identity verification.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1833](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1833)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.41.3" releaseDate="November 21st, 2022" />

* Better support for beginning a forgot password workflow using the API and completing the workflow in a themed page when a user also has 2FA enabled.
* Resolves [GitHub Issue #1965](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1965)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.41.0" releaseDate="November 10th, 2022" />

<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

### Known Issues
* A change to the FusionAuth HTTP server may cause issues with reverse proxies that default upstream connections to `HTTP/1.0`. The HTTP server we are using no longer supports `HTTP/1.0`. We have identified that `nginx` defaults all upstream connections to `HTTP/1.0`, and the HTTP server we are using no longer supports `HTTP/1.0`. For `nginx` specifically, you will need to set the proxy version by adding `proxy_http_version 1.1;` to your proxy config.

### Security
* Update `com.fasterxml.jackson.*` dependencies to version `2.14.0`. This update is proactive, there are no known exploits. See [CVE-2022-42003]([CVE-2022-42004](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42003) and )(https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42004).
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1913](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1913)

### Changed
* New themed pages added for WebAuthn. Please review your themes to ensure the new templates and localized messages are added.
  * See the [Theme](/docs/apis/themes) API and the [Theme](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/) documentation for additional details. Review the [Upgrading](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/#upgrading) section on the [Themes](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/) page for information on how to resolve potential breaking changes.
* WebAuthn re-authentication requires a new hidden form field named `userVerifyingPlatformAuthenticatorAvailable` to detect compatible devices/browsers and prompt the user to register a passkey. You can view the default templates to determine in which form to insert this field into any customized templates. This field must be present on the following pages:
  * OAuth authorize
  * OAuth complete registration
  * OAuth passwordless
  * OAuth register
  * OAuth two-factor
  * OAuth WebAuthn (new)

### Fixed
* Correct signature verification of a SAML v2 AuthN response after the certificate has been removed from Key Master.

  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1905](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1905)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.40.1" releaseDate="September 26th, 2022" />

<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.40.0" releaseDate="September 16th, 2022" />

### Changed
* If you are using MySQL or plan to use MySQL you will need to manually download the JDBC connector to allow FusionAuth to connect to a MySQL database. If you are using PostgreSQL, this change will not affect you. See the installation guide for additional information. We apologize in advance for the inconvenience this causes you, but the Oracle GPL licensing model makes it difficult for FusionAuth to easily delivery this capability.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1862](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1862)

### Fixed
* An exception may occur when you attempt to perform a `PATCH` request on a Group using a `roleId` that does not exist.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1872](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1872)
* URL escape the `identityProviderUser` in the admin UI to correctly build the View and Delete actions links.

  * [GitHub Issue #1884](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1884)

### New
* Native Windows support has been re-instated. We apologize for the gap in native Windows support, for those who have been waiting to upgrade since version `1.37.0` you may now upgrade with a native installer. Thank you for all of you who have voiced your opinions with how we are support a native Windows installation.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1848](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1848)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.39.0" releaseDate="September 11th, 2022" />

### Fixed
* When appending the `locale` request parameter on the Authorize request to pre-select the user's locale, the locale may still be incorrect for validation errors. For example, appending `locale=fr` will allow the initial render of the page to be localized in French when available. However, because the user did not manually modify the locale selector on the page, if the login fails due to a validation error, the error messages will be returned in the default locale which is generally English.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1713](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1713)
* Group application roles removed during a `PATCH` request to the Group API.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1717](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1717), thank you to [@paul-fink-silvacom](https://github.com/paul-fink-silvacom) for raising the issue!
* Corrections to the SAML v2 SP and IdP meta data.
  * The HTTP scheme was missing from the `entityID`. This issue was introduced in version `1.37.0`.
  * The `NameIdFormat` found in the SP meta data was always showing `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress` regardless of the value configured in the SAML v2 IdP.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1842](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1842)
* The potential exists to see an exception in the FusionAuth system logs when the internal login record service runs. It is unlikely you will experience this error unless you have very large login volumes.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1854](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1854)
* There is the potential for the Elasticsearch index to become out of sync with respect to group memberships when groups are being deleted, or group members are being deleted from a group.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1855](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1855)
* Add missing support for `en_GB` time and data format support in the FusionAuth admin UI when setting your preferred locale to `en_GB`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1858](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1858), thanks to [@adambowen](https://github.com/adambowen) for bringing this to our attention. It wasn't our intention to force our friends in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 to painfully read dates and times in the American 🇺🇸 format. Please accept our apologies. 😎

### Enhancements
* Better support for JSON Patch. Now supporting RFC 7386 `application/merge-patch+json` and RFC 6902 `application/json-patch+json`. Note that you may still make a request using the `PATCH` HTTP method using `application/json` and the current behavior should not be changed. All `patch*` methods found in the FusionAuth client libraries will still be using `application/json` for backwards compatibility. However, now that support for these new content types exists, we will be working to build support into our client libraries.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #441](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/441)
* Better developer feedback when the `Content-Type` request header is missing or incorrect.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #604](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/604)
* Additional SCIM support for the `PATCH` HTTP request method, and `filter` and `excludedAttributes` request attributes. The addition of these features allow the FusionAuth SCIM server to be compatible with Azure AD SCIM client and Okta SCIM client. The Group filter support has some limitations, see the [SCIM Group](/docs/apis/scim/scim-group#retrieve-a-group) API doc for additional details.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1761](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1761)
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1791](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1791)
* Add some missing message keys to default Theme message bundle.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1839](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1839)
* Remove an un-necessary db request when validating the user security scheme for a user in the FusionAuth admin UI.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1856](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1856)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.38.1" releaseDate="August 22nd, 2022" />

### Fixed
* Static resources such as CSS and JS may be missing a `Content-Type` header which may cause a proxy using `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` to fail to load the resource. This issue was introduced in version `1.37.0`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1831](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1831), thanks to [@sinqinc](https://github.com/sinqinc) for reporting.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1834](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1834), thanks to [@Aaron-Ritter](https://github.com/Aaron-Ritter) for reporting.
* Fix a potential error issue caused by a webhook handler calling back to FusionAuth which may trigger another webhook event. This fix should also improve the performance when sending many events for webhooks.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1836](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1836)
* Correct behavior during login when both self-service registration and require registration features are enabled. This configuration may cause a user to be directed to the registration required page during login instead of being registered automatically. If you encounter this error, you may either upgrade or disable the require registration configuration. This appears to be a regression introduced in version `1.36.5`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1837](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1837)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.38.0" releaseDate="August 17th, 2022" />

   * Forgot password -> `action="/password/forgot"`

### Security

* Allow deprecated XML signature algorithms that were removed in Java 17. It is still not recommended that you use any of these legacy SHA1 algorithms, but if you are unable to utilize a modern algorithm, they will be allowed.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1814](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1814)

### Changed

* Windows install has been removed. Our strategy is to support Windows using [WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) with our provided debian package. Please plan to utilize this strategy, and open a GitHub issue if you encounter issues with the installation.
  * Due to customer feedback, a native Windows installation option has been restored as of version `1.40.0`.
* Webhooks are no longer configured as "All applications" or limited to a single Application. They are now scoped to one or more tenants. If you previously had multiple webhooks configured within the same tenant, but scoped to separate Applications you will want to review your configuration and filter events in your own Webhook handler by the `applicationId`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1812](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1812)
* Deprecate Apache Tomcat specific configuration. See the [Configuration](/docs/reference/configuration) reference for additional detail.
  * `fusionauth-app.http.max-header-size` The default maximum size is now `64k`.
  * `fusionauth-app.http.cookie-same-site-policy` In most cases, cookies will be written using `SameSite=Lax`, and cookies used by the FusionAuth admin UI utilize `SameSite=Strict`. If you think there would be value in further customizing cookies by name, or security settings such as `SameSite`, please upvote [GitHub Issue #1414](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1414) and describe your intended use-case.
  * `fusionauth-app.management.port` This was an Apache Tomcat specific port that is no longer required.
  * `fusionauth-app.ajp.port` is now deprecated, this was an Apache Tomcat specific binary protocol used by Java applications.
  * `fusionauth-app.http.relaxed-path-chars` This option was not likely documented or in-use by anyone.
  * `fusionauth-app.http.relaxed-query-chars` This option was not likely documented or in-use by anyone.
* FastPath and normal startup commands have changed. For example, starting FusionAuth based upon Apache Tomcat used `catalina.sh` or `catalina.bat`, the startup process will now use `start.sh`. See install documentation for more details.
* When using the FusionAuth Docker image with MySQL, you will need to bundle the MySQL connector jar in the image, or add a layer to the stock FusionAuth image to ensure that `curl` is installed so that the MySQL connector jar can be downloaded it during startup. It is recommended that you build the connector into the image. See our example [Dockerfile](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/tree/master/docker/fusionauth/fusionauth-app-mysql) on GitHub for an example.

### Fixed

* Add the appropriate feedback to the users when attempting to change an email during a gated email verification that is already in-use.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1547](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1547)
* Correct the validation when deleting a key from Key Master when in use by a de-activated application.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1676](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1676)
* Perform implicit email verification when enabled and a setup password email request is completed.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1705](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1705)
* Handle URL encoded characters in the user-information part of the URL when connecting to Elasticsearch. This allows a username or password to be provided in the URL that have been URL encoded.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1745](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1745)
* When using the Change Password workflow in the hosted login pages for a user that has enabled 2FA, if you are not adding the OAuth2 parameters found in the `state` on the Change Password link built in the email template an error may occur when the user tries to complete the workflow.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1764](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1764)
* The Refresh Token retrieve API and the Session tab in admin UI will no longer show expired refresh tokens. While the previous behavior was working as designed, it was confusing to some clients, and an admin was not able to manually remove expired tokens.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1772](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1772)
* Fix Lambda JS validation when using ES6 features with the GraalJS engine.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1790](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1790), thanks to [@theogravity](https://github.com/theogravity) for reporting the issue!

### Enhancements

* Administrative Email Verification using the API or FusionAuth admin UI. When creating a user in the admin UI, you may now optionally create the user with an un-verified email when Email verification is enabled. See the [Verify Email](/docs/apis/users#verify-a-users-email) API for additional details.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1319](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1319)
* The Oauth2 Logout does not log a user out of FusionAuth app if logging out of another application in the same default tenant.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1699](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1699)
* Updates to our initial SCIM Server implementation released in version `1.36.0`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1702](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1702)
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1703](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1703)
* Better options to capture debug information when troubleshooting an SMTP connection issue. You no longer need to specify `mail.debug=true` in the advanced SMTP settings, and instead when enabling `debug` on the SMTP configuration a debug Event Log will be produced with the SMTP debug information.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1743](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1743)
* Support larger email templates on MySQL. Prior to this version the `TEXT` column data type was utilized which has a maximum size of `16k` in MySQL, now we are using `MEDIUMTEXT` which supports up to `16M`.
  * Resolves [GitHub #1788](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1788), thanks to [@darkeagle1337](https://github.com/darkeagle1337) for making the request!
* Improvements to the OAuth2 Logout endpoint. This endpoint now correctly supports the `POST` method in addition to the `GET` method, and you may now use an expired `id_token` in the `id_token_hint` parameter.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1792](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1792)
* Webhooks are now scoped to one or more tenants. Webhooks will no longer receive all events, but only events for the configured tenants. There is still an option for "All tenants" if you still wish to preserve the previous behavior.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1812](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1812)
* Any API response that returns a Refresh Token will now also return a `refresh_token_id` when in OAuth2 or a `refreshTokenId` in all other APIs. This may be useful to identify a refresh token for revocation when using a one-time use Refresh Token. This identifier is the primary key of the Refresh Token and can be used by the Refresh Token API.
* The Access Token will contain a new claim named `sid` which is the immutable identifier Refresh Token. This claim is not reserved, so it can be removed and will only be present when a refresh token is requested. This is different from the `sid` claim that is already returned in the `id_token`, that `sid` or Session Identifier is the SSO session identifier and is primarily used by FusionAuth to validate a logout request.
* When available the Refresh Token is now returned in the `JWTRefreshTokenRevokeEvent` event in the `refreshToken` field.
* The Login Ping API may now optionally take the request as a POST body.

### New

* Application scoped Multi-Factor authentication. This feature allows an application choose to participate in Multi-Factor when enabled, and optionally specify a separate TTL for trust scoped to a single application.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #763](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/763)
* You may optionally disable the IdP linking strategy for an Identity Provider. This allows you to restrict any automatic linking and manage all IdP linking through the API.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1551](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1551), thanks to [@epbensimpson](https://github.com/epbensimpson) for the suggestion.
* Added `fusionauth-app.http.read-timeout` to the configuration to optionally set the maximum read timeout when making requests to FusionAuth. See the [Configuration](/docs/reference/configuration) reference for additional detail.

### Internal

* Remove Apache Tomcat as the underlying application server, in favor of a more modern HTTP server based upon Netty.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1671](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1671)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.36.8" releaseDate="July 4th, 2022" />

### Fixed

* Fix the placeholder text in the entity grants search field.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1774](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1774)
* Correct the SCIM HTTP response code when a new resource is created to be `201`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1775](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1775)
* Correct the SCIM HTTP response code when a duplicate resource is attempted to be created to be `409`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1776](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1776)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.36.7" releaseDate="June 23rd, 2022" />

### Security
* Ensure the provided `client_id` matches the Application represented by the Refresh Token when performing a Refresh grant. This is marked as a security fix because the intended design is to ensure the Refresh Token does indeed match the requested `client_id`. However, the risk is minimal due to the caller still being required to have a valid set of client credentials, and must still present a valid refresh token.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1766](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1766) Thanks to [@gnarlium](https://github.com/gnarlium) for reporting the issue!

### Fixed
* The initial "start" phase of a user action triggered by a failed login configuration is not sent.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1654](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1654)
* When a SAML v2 SP is using an HTTP redirect binding during the Logout request FusionAuth make fail to complete the logout request.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1723](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1723)
* A timing issue exists where under load of creating logins and then deleting applications programatically, a login record for a now deleted application may get stuck in the queue causing exceptions when attempting to write the record to the database.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1765](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1765)
* Correct the `Content-Type` HTTP response header returned from the SCIM endpoints.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1769](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1769)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.36.6" releaseDate="June 16th, 2022" />

### Fixed

* When using Rate Limiting for Failed logins, the user may be able to login successfully after being rate limited - but prior to the end of the configured time period.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1758](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1758)
* When using a JWT Populate lambda and modifying the default value of the `aud` claim to be an array instead of a string value, this token can no longer be used by the Introspect endpoint. This fix allows you to modify the `aud` claim to be an array, and it may be used with the Introspect endpoint as long as the requested `client_id` is contained in the `aud` claim. The OAuth2 Logout endpoint was also updated to allow this same `aud` modification to be using an `id_token` as the `id_token_hint`. When using this style of token as an `id_token_hint`, the first value in the `aud` claim that is equal to a FusionAuth application Id will be utilized.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1759](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1759)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.36.5" releaseDate="June 13th, 2022" />

### Security
* Upgrade Java to get the patch for [CVE-2022-21449](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21449). Note that in version `1.36.4` FusionAuth manually patched this vulnerability. To ensure you are not vulnerable to this vulnerability, upgrade to FusionAuth version `1.36.4` or later, or discontinue use of the Elliptic Curve algorithm.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1672](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1672)
* Fix validation of the Oauth2 Logout endpoint when using the `post_logout_redirect` parameter. As [documented here](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/endpoints#logout), you must ensure that any value for this parameter is in the Authorized URLs list for the application. This may be a breaking change if you do not.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1750](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1750)

### Fixed
* Fix a UI bug that caused the application column to show "Single sign-on" instead of the Application name in the Session tab of the user management panel.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1706](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1706)
*  If you have enabled Two-Factor authentication and self-service registration, a user may not be routed to the Complete Registration step correctly after completing the Two-Factor challenge.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1708](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1708), thanks to [@chimericdream](https://github.com/chimericdream) for reporting the issue!
* The `displayName` property on the [Link a User](/docs/apis/identity-providers/links#link-a-user) API is ignored. This is a regression bug that was introduced in version `1.36.0`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1728](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1728)
* A 3rd party Web Application Firewall such as CloudFlare may inject JavaScript into the `<head>` element and this may cause a failure to properly initialize support for an Identity Provider such as Twitter.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1731](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1731), thanks to [@atakane](https://github.com/atakane) for helping us track this one down!

### Internal
* Upgrade to the latest Java 17 LTS. Upgraded from 17.0.1+12 to 17.0.3+7.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1672](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1672)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.36.4" releaseDate="April 21st, 2022" />

### Security
* Proactive patch for Java [CVE-2022-21449](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21449). This release will patch the vulnerability described in the referenced CVE until we are able to release a version of FusionAuth using the upcoming patched release of Java. If you are not able to upgrade to this release, discontinue use of ECDSA keys in FusionAuth for JWT or SAML signing.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1694](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1694)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.36.3" releaseDate="April 19th, 2022" />

### Fixed
* An additional edge case was identified in the issue resolved by [GitHub Issue #1687](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1687). If you did encounter the issue resolved by [GitHub Issue #1687](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1687), you should plan to upgrade to this patch version so that you can fully utilize the new `auth_time` claim introduced in `1.36.0`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1688](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1688)

<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.36.2" releaseDate="April 14th, 2022" />

### Fixed
* If you are using the `openid` scope which produces an `id_token`, and you utilize a 3rd party library that consumes the `id_token` to validate the signature, expiration or similar claims, the token may be incorrectly identified as expired. This is because after a refresh token is used to generate a new `id_token` the `auth_time` claim may have lost precision from the original value in the initial `id_token`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1687](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1687)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.36.1" releaseDate="April 14th, 2022" />

### Fixed
* When building an entity grant in the UI for a user or other entity, the search results may contain entities from all tenants. If you attempt to select an entity in a tenant other than the tenant for which the user or entity belongs, an exception will occur.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1579](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1579)
* If you create an empty directory in the FusionAuth plugin directory, or create a directory that does not contain any FusionAuth plugin jars, and have other plugin jars in the root of the plugin directory, the legitimate plugin jar may not be loaded. If you encounter this problem, either remove the empty directories, or make the empty directories read only.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1683](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1683)
* If you are using the Client Credentials Grant and omit the permissions from the `target-entity:` scope, the expected permissions will not be returned as part of the access token claims.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1686](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1686)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.36.0" releaseDate="April 7th, 2022" />

<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

### Known Issues
* If you create an empty directory in the FusionAuth plugin directory, or create a directory that does not contain any FusionAuth plugin jars, and have other plugin jars in the root of the plugin directory, the legitimate plugin jar may not be loaded. If you encounter this problem, either remove the empty directories, or make the empty directories read only.
  * This has been resolved in version `1.36.1`.
* If you are using the Client Credentials Grant and omit the permissions from the `target-entity:` scope, the expected permissions will not be returned as part of the access token claims.
  * This has been resolved in version `1.36.1`.
* If you are using the `openid` scope which produces an `id_token`, and you utilize a 3rd party library that consumes the `id_token` to validate the signature, expiration or similar claims, the token may be incorrectly identified as expired. This is because after a refresh token is used to generate a new `id_token` the `auth_time` claim may have lost precision from the original value in the initial `id_token`.
  * This has been resolved in version `1.36.3`.

### Security
* Ensure that the Change Password identifier is revoked if an API is used to change a user's password after the user has initiated a change password request.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1632](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1632)

### Changed
* The JWT authorization method is no longer supported when using the `GET` method on the [Retrieve Refresh Tokens](/docs/apis/jwt#retrieve-refresh-tokens) API.
  * The reason for this potentially breaking change is due to concern of potential abuse. If you were previously using a JWT to authorize the request to the `GET` HTTP method, you will need to modify your integration to utilize an API key. See the [Retrieve Refresh Tokens](/docs/apis/jwt#retrieve-refresh-tokens) API for additional details.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1646](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1646)
* Updated reserved JWT claims by grant type. The `amr` claims is marked as reserved, and will be available in a future release.
  * Reserved for authorization code and implicit grant, `amr`, `exp`, `iat`, `sub` and `tid`. Only `amr` and `tid` are new for this release.
  * Reserved for Vending API `amr`, `exp` and `iat`. Only the `amr` claim is new for this release.
  * Reserved for Client Credentials grant, `amr`, `aud`, `exp`, `iat`, `permissions`, `sub` and `tid`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1669](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1669)

### Fixed
* The requested `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` in a SAML v2 `AuthNRequest` is ignored and the first URL configured is used instead.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1278](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1278), thanks to [@pakomp](https://github.com/pakomp) for letting us know!
* Entities don't support the use of `:` in the permission name, this limitation has been removed.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1480](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1480), thanks to [@matthewhartstonge](https://github.com/matthewhartstonge) for the help!
* An application role may not be immediately available to assign to a user after initial creation. This issue was due to some additional caching introduced in version `1.32.1`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1575](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1575)
* The Password Grant response is missing the Two Factor Method Ids when a Two-Factor challenge is required. This issue was introduced in version `1.26.0` when Two-Factor Method Ids were added to the Login API response.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1585](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1585)
* The Tenant edit and add panel displays Webhook events that are not configured at the Tenant level.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1593](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1593)
* FusionAuth may fail to start on Windows when using the `startup.bat` script. See linked issue for a workaround.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1624](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1624), thanks to [@James-M-Oswald](https://github.com/James-M-Oswald) for the assist!
* Enhance email validation to keep obviously incorrect emails from being used during self-service user registration.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1625](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1625), thanks to [@pablomadrigal](https://github.com/pablomadrigal) for letting us know!
* When using the GraalJS Lambda engine, you cannot use ECMA 6 features such as `const` or `let`.
  * This only affects version `1.35.0` when using the new GraalJS engine, and does not represent a regression because prior to version `1.35.0` the only Lambda engine available was Nashorn which only supported ECMA 5.1.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1630](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1630)
* When using a Connector, a timing issue exists that could cause a login to fail. See the linked issue for an example exception that you may observe if you encounter this issue.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1633](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1633)
* The Tenant View dialog may show the incorrect Event transaction setting for a Tenant created via the API.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1642](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1642)
* When the `openid` scope is used along with the `offline_access` scope and then the resulting refresh token is used in a Refresh grant, the returned `id_token` may be signed with the key configured for the `access_token`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1643](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1643)
* Ignore read-only directories inside of the configured plugin directory instead of throwing an exception.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1655](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1655)

### Enhancements
* Add a separate execute thread pool in the Apache Tomcat configuration to separate incoming requests from localhost callback requests to reduce thread contention.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1659](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1659)
* Allow for plugins that require dependent jars in their classpath.
  * To take advantage of this capability, create a sub-directory in the configured plugin directory. Place your plugin jar, and any dependant jars in the same directory or nested sub-directories. Each immediate sub-directory of the configured plugin directory will be considered a discrete classloader. Each of these class loaders will still share the parent classloader, so it is still advised to keep dependencies to a bare minimum such that you don't conflict with existing dependencies of FusionAuth.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1663](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1663)
* Minimize the duration of the database Transaction during authentication. This should improve login performance, especially when using an LDAP or Generic Connector.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1666](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1666) (666 😱 yikes)
* Alphabetize the Applications in Select form controls in the FusionAuth admin UI, this should make it easier for those are not robots to navigate when you have many applications.
  * [GitHub Issue #1668](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1668)
* Allow a login using a 3rd party IdP such as Google to succeed even if an Elasticsearch exception occurs when attempting to re-index the user.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1673](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1673)

### New

* Default the Event Transaction Type in the Tenant configuration to `None`
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1644](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1644)
* New JWT claims
  * The `tid` claim is now being set in all JWTs. This is the FusionAuth Tenant Id, and is marked as reserved.
  * The JWT header will also now contain a `gty` claim which will represent the grant types in order of use for this token.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1669](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1669)

### Internal
* Update Apache Tomcat from `8.5.72` to `8.5.77`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1620](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1620)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.35.0" releaseDate="March 10th, 2022" />

<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

### Fixed
* When using the FastPath installation for Windows, the startup may fail to download Java if you are using the `startup.bat` option for starting services.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1597](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1597), thanks to [@gkrothammer](https://github.com/gkrothammer) for the help!
* Using the Identity Provider Link API when more than one tenant is configured may fail unless you are specifying the tenant Id using the `X-FusionAuth-TenantId` HTTP request header.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1609](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1609)
* Self-service registration may fail to validate an email address beginning with `@`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1617](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1617), thanks to [@pablomadrigal](https://github.com/pablomadrigal) for letting us know!
* Using the Passwordless API without passing the OAuth2 state parameters on the URL such as `client_id`, and the user is not registered for the Application, the request may fail.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1623](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1623)

### New
* Initial technology preview for HTTP requests within a lambda function, termed Lambda HTTP Connect. All previously configured lambdas will continue to run on the legacy JS engine. Starting in this release the default engine for newly created lambdas will be GraalJS, but you have the ability to select the preferred engine. When using the GraalJS engine, you will be able to begin making HTTP requests within the lambda function. At some point in the future we will deprecate and fully remove the legacy JS engine (Nashorn). For the time being, use the new engine if you are able, and provide us feedback if you find anything is not working. If you do encounter a problem open an issue, and switch the lambda back to the Nashorn engine.
  * HTTP requests (AJAX) in the lambda requires Essentials or Enterprise edition.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #267](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/267)
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #571](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/571)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.34.1" releaseDate="February 23rd, 2022" />

### Fixed
* SAML v2 Login to FusionAuth may fail due to an exception.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1606](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1606), thanks so much to [@kristianvld](https://github.com/kristianvld) for letting us know.


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.34.0" releaseDate="February 21st, 2022" />

### Known Issues
* SAML v2 Login to FusionAuth may fail due to an exception. Please upgrade directly to FusionAuth version >= 1.34.1
  * See [GitHub Issue #1606](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1606) for additional details.

### Security
* Resolve a potential vulnerability in the IdP Link API. If you are actively using any IdP configured to use the `CreatePendingLink` linking strategy, please upgrade at your earliest convenience.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1600](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1600)

### Changed
* When using the OpenID Connect identity provider, you have the option to select one of three client authentication options. You may select `none`, `client_secret_basic` or `client_secret_post`. Some 3rd party identity providers do not allow the `client_id` to be sent in the request body when using `client_secret_basic`. A strict reading of the OAuth2 and OpenID Connect specifications imply that the `client_id` should only be present in the request body when a client secret is not used, or you have selected `none` or `client_secret_post` for an authentication method. This change is to make FusionAuth more compliant with 3rd party IdPs that enforce this behavior. It is not expected that this change will have any negative impact on OpenID Connect configurations that have been working up until this release. However, please be aware of this change and verify existing OpenID Connect identity providers continue to behave as expected.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1595](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1595)
* Utilize PKCE anytime FusionAuth is initiating an Authorization Code grant to FusionAuth. While most of this will be transparent and should not affect any of your integrations, there is one use case in which it is important for FusionAuth to utilize PKCE when performing an Authorization Code grant to FusionAuth. This use case is when you are using an application with PKCE configured as required, and you then use the Device grant using the themed FusionAuth pages. In this case FusionAuth must utilize PKCE in order to pass PKCE validation during the request.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1598](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1598)
* When using the interactive Setup Wizard to perform initial setup of FusionAuth, the checkbox to sign up for the FusionAuth newsletter has been changed to be checked by default. This means that prior to this release you had to opt-in, and starting in this release, you will need to opt-out during this step. You also have the option to un-subscribe from the newsletter at any point in the future.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1577](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1577)

### New
* Native support for PBKDF2 using a 512-bit derived key length. The default PBKDF2 algorithm uses a 256-bit derived key length. Some IdPs such as KeyCloak use a 512-bit key, so this plugin should support an import from KeyCloak without using a custom plugin. This new algorithm is available using the value `salted-pbkdf2-hmac-sha256-512` during the User Import API.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1604](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1604)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.33.0" releaseDate="February 7th, 2022" />

<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

### Security
* Add `-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true` to the `fusionauth-search` bundled version of Elasticsearch.
  * Please note, that if you are running a standalone version of Elasticsearch, this will not affect you, and you should still complete any suggested mitigation steps for your Elasticsearch instance. This VM argument added to the `fusionauth-search` bundle is only added to make people feel warm and fuzzy. FusionAuth Cloud users are not vulnerable to [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228), and even if you are self-hosting FusionAuth and utilizing the Elasticsearch bundled with `fusionauth-search` you are not vulnerable if you have followed our suggested securing steps. Also due to the version of Java we are using to run Elasticsearch, you are not vulnerable. But we all like to put on our tinfoil hats sometimes, so we are making this change for good measure.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1520](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1520)
* Updated PostgreSQL JDBC driver from version `42.2.22` to `42.3.2`.
  * This update is only pertinent to you if you are using a PostgreSQL database. If you are using MySQL, you are not vulnerable.
  * FusionAuth Cloud users are not affected. If you are self-hosting FusionAuth you are only vulnerable if you allow un-authorized modifications to your JDBC connection string used by FusionAuth to connect to the database. I hope you are not doing this. 😉 Please read the following CVE to better understand the vulnerability to see how it may or may not affect you.
  * [CVE-2022-21724](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21724).
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1535](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1535)
* Proactively upgrade Logback. Instead of Log4J, FusionAuth uses Logback. In response to the recent vulnerabilities in Log4J, the Logback team has proactively added some additional hardening to their library to ensure similar vulnerabilities are not found.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1530](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1530)
* Better protection against malicious actors that have access to configuring Themed templates.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1549](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1549)
* Ensure we enforce a Two-Factor challenge before changing a password using the Change Password API.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1591](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1591)

### Changed
* If you are using the Change Password API with users that have Two-Factor enabled you may need to adjust your integration. Beginning in this release, to use the Change Password API for a user with Two-Factor enabled, you will need to obtain a Trust Token from the Two Factor Login API in order to complete this request. This is potentially a breaking change, the decision was made to make this potentially breaking change due to the enhanced security provided by this change.

  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1591](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1591)

### Fixed
* The FastPath install may fail to download Java on versions `>= 1.32.0`. The issue was that the `curl` request needed to be configured to follow a redirect with the new URLs for the Java download.  See the linked issue for a workaround if you want to use FastPath for an older version.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1519](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1519)
* Ensure we are able to handle Login records that may contain more than one IP address. When passing through a proxy, the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP request header may contain more than one IP address. This fix ensures we parse this header correctly and handle existing Login records that may have been recorded with more than one value.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1521](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1521)
* Using the Login with Apple button on a themed login or registration page may fail when using Safari on iOS 12. A workaround is documented in the linked GitHub issue if you are unable to upgrade FusionAuth.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1526](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1526)
* The Event Log, Audit Log, Login Records search feature in the FusionAuth admin UI may not reset the pagination correctly when beginning a new search request.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1501](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1501)
* Group Membership may not be preserved after the first login request when using a Connector without migration.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1432](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1432)
* The `jwt.refresh-token.revoke` event may not be sent during a request to the Logout API (`/api/logout`).
  * Resolves   [GitHub Issue #1522](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1522), thanks to [@TimVanHerwijnen](https://github.com/TimVanHerwijnen) for all the help!
* A consent added to a self-service registration form may show up incorrectly during a complete registration step during login.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1259](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1259)
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1261](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1261)
* Better support for `user.birthDate` when using Advanced self-service registration when Family is enabled with child registration.
  * [GitHub Issue #1490](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1490)
* When configuring more than one preferred language in the FusionAuth admin UI on the User or User Registration, the order may not be preserved. For example, if you configured `French, English` where `French` is the preferred languages, with a second option of `English`, when saving the form, the serialized value will become `English, French` and will not likely be saved in the order you expect.
  * [GitHub Issue #1131](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1131)
* Fix a potential memory leak in the Email services. If you are sending a lot of email through FusionAuth, this error may cause your FusionAuth service to run out of memory. Restarting the service periodically can mitigate this potential if you are unable to upgrade. This issue was most likely introduced in version `1.30.1`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1548](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1548)
* When completing a Family workflow where a parent joins a child to a family, the `parentEmail` field may not be properly updated in the search index.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1550](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1550)
* If you have previously configured Basic Self-Service registration, and then begin using Advanced Self-Service it is possible that a validation may occur that you did not expect.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1560](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1560)
* Some edge cases exist when using the Async Tenant Delete API or deleting a Tenant in the FusionAuth admin UI where a tenant may get stuck in the Pending Delete state.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1559](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1559)

### Enhancements
* Add the underlying host architecture and operating system name and version to the About panel in the FusionAuth admin UI. See <strong>System -> About</strong>.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1531](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1531)
* Add a tooltip to the Webhook Application configuration to help reduce some confusion until we deprecate this Application configuration.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1542](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1542)
* Support longer Refresh Tokens on the Refresh Tokens Import API. The previous limitation was that the refresh token was less than or equal to `191` characters. The assumption was made that this token was opaque and that `191` was very adequate. Some IdPs utilize JWTs for Refresh Tokens and in this case, the length is likely to exceed the previous limitation. This enhancements allows for longer refresh tokens. In particular this will provide better support for importing Refresh Tokens from KeyCloak. See the [Import Refresh Tokens](/docs/apis/users#import-refresh-tokens) API for additional details.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1541](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1541)
* Use a better thread pooling strategy for Webhooks to better support a very large volume of events where the event recipient may not respond quickly enough. This allows more events to be queued up if we cannot send them fast enough while waiting for a response from the webhook.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1500](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1500)
* Improve licensing errors on the API and FusionAuth admin UI to better differentiate between not licensed, and a feature that requires a specific licensed feature. In particular, some of the features introduced as part of the Threat Detection feature require an Enterprise License with this feature enabled. So you may have a licensed edition of FusionAuth, and a feature may still not be available. This change should make it clearer why a particular feature cannot be enabled.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1555](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1555)
* Add `tokenExpirationInstant` to the Login Response similar to how the Token endpoint response returns `expires_in` to indicate when the access token returned in the response will expire.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1309](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1309)
* Additional User API validation in support of Family configuration with child registration restrictions.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1561](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1561)
* Support for ARM 64, the Apple M1, AWS Graviton, etc. Docker images are now published for Intel, and various ARM architectures, and FastPath and other installation paths have support for downloading Java for the correct architecture.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1532](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1523), [GitHub Issue #49](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/issues/49). Thanks to many of our community superstars for the help with this one! [@rscheuermann](https://github.com/rscheuermann), [@jerryhopper](https://github.com/jerryhopper), [@ceefour](https://github.com/ceefour), [@dmitryzan](https://github.com/dmitryzan)
* Add the option to use the `userId` on the Start Two-Factor API
  ** Resolves [GitHub Issue #1571](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1571)
* Move the `changePasswordId` to the request body during a POST request. For backwards compatibility, the `changePasswordId` will also be accepted on the URL segment.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1214](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1214)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.32.1" releaseDate="December 13th, 2021" />

### Fixed
* If you are modifying the user email or username in an Identity Provider Reconcile Lambda, the lambda may be invoked more than once after the initial link has been established. This may cause User registration data to be modified, or lost. If you have not yet upgraded to this version, it is advised that you wait until you can update to version `1.32.1`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1517](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1517), thanks to [@Oceanswave](https://github.com/Oceanswave) for letting us know and for the fantastic bug write up!
* The `1.32.0` version of the Docker image was initially released with a missing Java module that may cause the image to fail during startup. An updated version of the image has been released, if you encounter an issue, please delete your local version of the image and pull it again. The issue is also resolved in this version, so you may also pull the `latest` tag once this version is available.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1518](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1518)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.32.0" releaseDate="December 10th, 2021" />

<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

### Changed
* This version of FusionAuth will now run on Java 17. If you are using any SAML v2 IdP configurations that still utilize a legacy XML signature algorithm, this upgrade may break that integration.
  * It is recommended to test your SAML v2 IdP logins with this version prior to upgrading, or confirm that all of your IdPs are not using any of the following restricted XML signature algorithms:
  ** `http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#sha1`
  ** `http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#dsa-sha1`
  ** `http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-sha1`
  * See [GitHub Issue #1202](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-site/issues/1202) for additional details and an optional workaround if you are unable to discontinue use of these algorithms.

### Fixed
* The global and application registration count rollup may fail when using PostgreSQL. This will cause the registration count reports to be incorrect.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1498](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1498)
* When using the Development Reset feature (technical preview) and the FusionAuth application is configured to use a specific theme, the reset will fail.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1514](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1514)

### Enhancements
* Identity provider linking that was introduced in version 1.28.0 can now optionally be configured to limit the number of unique links to an IdP for a particular user.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1310](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1310)
* Allow application URIs to be configured as an OAuth2 Authorized request origin URLs. For example, you may now configure `android-app://com.example` as a valid Authorized request origin.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1443](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1443), thanks to [@bonify-b2b](https://github.com/bonify-b2b) for the request.
* Add configuration to allow implicit email verification to be disabled. For example, prior to this release, email based workflows such as Passwordless login, email based registration verification, email based password change, and verifying a two-factor code during login through an email would implicitly mark a user's email as verified if email verification was enabled and the user had not yet completed email verification. In most cases this seems to be the best choice for the end user such that they do not perform redundant tasks to verify their email address once they have provided evidence they have access to the email address. This configuration allows this behavior to be disabled if you wish to require your end user to always go through a specific email verification process for legal or other similar reasons.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1467](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1467), thanks to [@lliu-20200701](https://github.com/lliu-20200701) for the request.
* Add a notice on the Device workflow panel when an existing SSO session exists to allow the user to optionally logout prior to continuing.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1495](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1495)

### New
* You may optionally specify custom SMTP headers in the Tenant email configuration. These configured headers will be added to all outbound messages.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #628](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/628), thanks to [arni-inaba](https://github.com/arni-inaba) for the suggestion.

### Internal
* Java 17 LTS. Update to the latest long term support version of Java.


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.31.0" releaseDate="November 18th, 2021" />

### Known Issues
* If you are modifying the user email or username in an Identity Provider Reconcile Lambda, the lambda may be invoked more than once after the initial link has been established. This may cause User registration data to be modified, or lost. If you have not yet upgraded to this version, it is advised that you wait until you can update to version `1.32.1`.
  * Resolved in `1.32.1` by [GitHub Issue #1517](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1517)

### Changed
* You may now modify, or fabricate an email or username in the Identity Provider Reconcile Lambda regardless of the Identity Provider type.
  * Some of this capability has been provided in the past for the OpenID Connect Identity Provider. This capability was removed in version `1.28.0` when Identity Provider Linking was introduced due to the additional use cases now supported through linking strategies. Due to high demand, and many real world use-cases presented by our users, this decision has been reversed in favor of flexibility for the developer. Please use caution when using this capability, and note that if you create or modify a `username` or `email` in the Reconcile lambda, the lambda will be invoked twice during a single login request.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1425](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1425)

  * This issue was introduced in version `1.30.2` vi [GitHub Issue #480](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/480)
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1473](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1473)
* When using the Setup Password email template provided by FusionAuth with the User Registration API to create a User and a Registration in a single API call the URL generated and sent to the user may not be usable. A `client_id` will have been added to the URL which will result in an error when the FusionAuth page is rendered.

<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.30.2" releaseDate="October 13th, 2021" />

<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

### Fixed
* When logging in with an anonymous user from an IdP that now has a linking strategy other than Anonymous an exception occurs. This can occur if you change your linking strategy from Anonymous to something else, and users that were created while configured as Anonymous log in again.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1316](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1316)
* The view dialog may not completely render for an SAML v2 IdP Initiated IdP configuration. The dialog fails to completely render due to a FreeMarker exception.

<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

### Known Issues
* If you are referencing any Reconcile Lambda Ids using the syntax `FUSIONAUTH_LAMBDA{type}_ID` - this may no longer work due to a change in how these default lambdas are initialized.
  * The current work around is to modify your kickstart to build your own version of this lambda instead of using the FusionAuth default.
  * You will find a copy of the default lambdas shipped with FusionAuth in the [Lambda](/docs/extend/code/lambdas/) documentation that you may use to copy into your kickstart.
  * The issue is being tracked here [GitHub Issue #1373](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1373)

### Fixed
* Unable to enable `user.action` event at the tenant using the UI. If you encounter this issue, you may work around it by using the Tenant API.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1307](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1307)
* If you make an API request to `/api/two-factor/login` with an empty JSON body, an exception will occur instead of a validation error being returned with a `400` status code.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1330](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1330)
* When using an IdP with a linking mode other than Create Pending Link, the token may not correctly be stored. If you previously had been using the token stored on the User Registration, and are now looking for it in the Identity Provider Link, you may not find it. This fix resolves the issue.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1341](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1341)
* When you are using FusionAuth as a SAML v2 IdP with Redirect bindings, you were unable to use idp_hint to bypass the login page to federate to another provider.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1331](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1331)


### Changed
* New themed page added for Unauthorized access.
  * See the [Theme](/docs/apis/themes) API and the [Theme](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/) documentation for additional details.
* A macro available to themes named `[@helpers.input]` was modified to be able to build a checkbox. This change could affect you if you try to copy and paste the checkbox usage without modifying the macro definition in your Helper file. Review the [Upgrading](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/#upgrading) section on the [Themes](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/) page for information on how to resolve potential breaking changes.

<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.29.4" releaseDate="August 12th, 2021" />

### Fixed
* When a user is required to complete registration after login, the user may no longer be able to login w/out a password reset. This is a regression from version 1.28.0, and only affects those using self-service registration that will have existing users that do not have all required fields on their account.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1344](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1344), thanks to [@flangfeldt](https://github.com/flangfeldt) for reporting the issue


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.29.3" releaseDate="August 6th, 2021" />

  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1332](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1332)



<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.29.1" releaseDate="July 26th, 2021" />

<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

### Fixed
* In a multi-tenant configuration, SSO sessions may be pre-maturely terminated if one tenant has a lower TTL configuration than the other tenants. To work around this issue prior to this release, ensure all SSO TTL configurations are equal.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1262](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1262)
* The arg names in the `LambdaType` enum were not all correct.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1284](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1284)

  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1315](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1315)
* When enabling the SAMl v2 IdP debug log an exception may be taken when attempting to produce the debug event log. The result is that the debug log will not be produced.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1317](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1317)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.29.0" releaseDate="July 10th, 2021" />

### Fixed
* When viewing the theme preview for the `oauth2/start-idp-link.ftl` template, and error may be logged.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1276](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1276)
* When a webhook transaction fails to create a user or registration on a themed page, a non-themed error page may be displayed
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1279](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1279)

### Enhancements
* Enhance the Link API to retrieve a user by a 3rd party unique Id to identify a FusionAuth user is linked to the user. See the [Link](/docs/apis/identity-providers/links) API for additional details.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1277](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1277)
* During a device link request which contains a device linking token, show an intermediate page asking the user if they would like to sign in with an existing user or create a new user.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1287](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1287)
* Allow the IdP Login API to optionally be passed a request parameter to indicate a link should not be established and a `404` should be returned instead. This is useful if you wish to identify if a link exists first before starting an auxiliary workflow such as a device grant with a linking token. See the [Login](/docs/apis/identity-providers/) API for additional details.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1288](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1288)
* Add additional configuration to the unique username configuration to support always appending a suffix even when the username is not in use. See the [Tenant](/docs/apis/tenants) API for additional details.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1290](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1290)
* Add an additional debug event log when for the SAML IdP to debug the `AuthN` request sent to the SAML IdP
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1293](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1293)
* In version `1.28.0` the resolution of the value returned by the SAML v2 IdP in the `NameID` was modified. If the IdP returns a format of `unspecified` with a value of `email` then after upgrading to version `1.28.0` your SAML IdP will not function properly. Ideally you would ask your IdP to return you a NameID format of `emailAddress`, but if that is not possible this enhancement will allow FusionAuth to accept the value returned in the `NameID` if the format is returned as `unspecified`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1294](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1294)
* Instead of logging FreeMarker exceptions to the system log and producing a stack trace that may end up in the UI, an event log will be produced. The message in the UI will be condensed based upon the runtime mode. When in `development` mode some details will be provided to assist in debugging your themed template. If in `production` runtime mode only a message indicating an error occurred will be displayed to the user.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1299](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1299)

### Internal
* Update HikariCP from `3.4.1` to `4.0.3`, and update PostgreSQL JDBC driver from `42.2.14` to `42.2.22`
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1300](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1300)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.28.1" releaseDate="June 21st, 2021" />

<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

* An imported user requiring password change, and email verification may fail to verify email verification with an email verification gate.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1265](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1265)
* Better parsing of the `X-Fowarded-For` HTTP request header. This header may contain one to many IP addresses, and only the first value should be preserved for the login record. Prior to this fix, it would be possible to see a login record that contained multiple IP addresses separated by a comma.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1267](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1267)
* Correctly show the Verification URL in the OAuth2 configuration when the `Device` grant is selected. This issue was introduced in `1.28.0`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1268](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1268)
* Use the correct FusionAuth redirect URL when using the Sony Playstation Network IdP.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1269](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1269)

  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1272](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1272)
* Allow the Epic Games IdP to function properly when omitting the `scope` configuration property.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1273](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1273)

### Tech Preview
* You may optionally start an account link when beginning a Device grant.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1274](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1274)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.28.0" releaseDate="June 7rd, 2021" />

<GeneralMigrationWarning warning_message="The FusionAuth identity providers have undergone a significant improvement to add additional flexibility and support for 3rd parties. Please take time to test this upgrade with your existing configuration to ensure compatibility. Some of the features in this release are in tech-preview." />

<DatabaseMigrationWarning warning_message="The FusionAuth identity providers have undergone a significant improvement to add additional flexibility and support for 3rd parties. Please take time to test this upgrade with your existing configuration to ensure compatibility. Some of the features in this release are in tech-preview." />

### Known Issues
* If you are using self-service registration there is a possibility that a user may be required to complete registration by adding additional fields to their account after they login. In this scenario it is possible that they will no longer be able to login and will be required to reset their password. The fix for this was added in `1.29.4`.
  * Fixed in `1.29.4`, under [GitHub Issue #1344](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1344), thanks to [@flangfeldt](https://github.com/flangfeldt) for reporting the issue
* If you are using the [SAML v2 Populate Lambda](/docs/extend/code/lambdas/samlv2-response-populate) or the [SAML v2 Reconcile Lambda](/docs/extend/code/lambdas/samlv2-response-reconcile) the `NameID` field has been changed to an array. You will need to update your lambda code if you are using this field.

### Changed
* You may no longer build a synthetic email address using a lambda for an OpenID Connect identity provider. This has been removed because you may now link a user by username or create a link w/out a username or an email to an existing FusionAuth user. If you are using this feature, you may need to plan for a migration to this new behavior. If you have a support contract with FusionAuth, please reach out and ask for additional information.
* When using FusionAuth as a SAML IdP, FusionAuth will now accept `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent` in addition to `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress`. This should allow FusionAuth to work with SAML v2 service providers that only support the persistent NameID format.
* Tokens returned by IdPs are no longer stored on the User Registration object in the `tokens` field. Each token is now stored with the IdP link for the User and the IdP. See the [Link](/docs/apis/identity-providers/links) API for additional details.

### New
* Reindex API
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1232](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1232)
  * See the [Reindex](/docs/apis/system#rebuild-the-elasticsearch-index) API for usage.
* Account Link API
  * This API will allow you to link and un-link users in 3rd party identity providers with a FusionAuth user.
  * See the [Link](/docs/apis/identity-providers/links) API for usage.
* IdP Linking options
  * Each Identity Provider may now be configured with a linking strategy. The strategies will include linking by email, username, anonymous or a link to an existing user.
  * Linking by username is now supported. There is a higher risk of account takeover using this strategy, you should use caution when using this feature.
  * Tokens from identity providers should now be retrieved from the link, rather than the registration. More information can be found under `identityProviderLink.token` response value [here](/docs/apis/identity-providers/links#retrieve-a-link)
* Email Send API allows an email address in the To field instead of only allowing FusionAuth userIds
  * See the [Email Send](/docs/apis/emails#send-an-email) API for additional details.
* SAML Identity Provider can now be configured to use any NameID format. Previously only the Email NameID format was utilized.
  * This should allow the SAML identity provider configuration to be more flexible and work with additional SAML identity providers.

### Enhanced
* When FusionAuth is acting as a SAML Identity Provider, you may now send a NameID format of Email or Persistent.
  * This should allow FusionAuth to work with additional SAML service providers such as Slack.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #522](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/522)
* The [Email Send](/docs/apis/emails#send-an-email) API now allows you to send to a user that does not yet exist in FusionAuth by allowing you to specify an email address for the `To:` field.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #743](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/743)
  * See the  [Email Send](/docs/apis/login) API for additional details.
* The Facebook and Google Identity Providers will now default to using a redirect instead of a popup for login. All existing configurations will be migrated to use the popup dialog to remain consistent with the previous behavior. With this update you may now also use the `idp_hint` parameter to login with Facebook and Google.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #909](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/909)
* Additional PKCE and Client Authentication configuration
  * You may now optionally configure PKCE as required, not required, or required when not using a confidential client. This offers better compatibility when multiple client types (a webapp and a mobile app, for example) are authenticating against a single FusionAuth application.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1152](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1152)
* Add the currently selected Two Factor method object to the Themed Two Factor page `/oauth2/two-factor`
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1237](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1237), thanks to one of our MVPs - [@flangfeldt](https://github.com/flangfeldt) for the suggestion!
* Allow using IdP buttons on the Themed registration page
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #554](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/554), thanks to [@gordody](https://github.com/gordody) for the request!
* When using email verification required with the gated configuration, optionally send the user another email before entering the gated page if the user does not have an existing verification email that is not expired.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1247](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1247), thanks to [@lliu-20200701](https://github.com/lliu-20200701) for the suggestion.

  * The client libraries methods have also been preserved, but a new method has been added to accept a request body.
* When calling `PUT` on the Login API (ping) the response may optionally return an `emailVerificationId` or `registrationVerificationId` to assist the developer in completing a verification workflow when the verification strategy has been configured to use a short code instead of a long "clickable" link.
  * See the Login API response for additional details.
* The User API and Registration API may optionally return an `emailVerificationId` or a map of registration verification Ids to assist the developer in completing a verification workflow when the verification strategy has been configured to use a short code instead of a long "clickable" link.

<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.26.1" releaseDate="April 20th, 2021" />

### Fixed
* If you use a non default theme for the FusionAuth default tenant, you may see an error when trying to log in to the admin UI after upgrading to version 1.25.0. You can workaround this by appending `?&bypassTheme=true` to your login URL, or append `/admin/` to your base FusionAuth URL to log into the admin UI.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1175](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1175).

### Known Issues
* You cannot create a "SAML v2 IdP Initiated" Identity Provider in the admin UI; it isn't present in the "Add Identity Providers" dropdown. You can workaround this by entering the URL to add an Identity Provider manually: `\[GitHub Issue #1181](https://auth.example.com/admin/identity-provider/add/SAMLv2IdPInitiated` (append `/admin/identity-provider/add/SAMLv2IdPInitiated` to your FusionAuth base URL). Tracking in https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1181).



<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.26.0" releaseDate="April 20th, 2021" />

<GeneralMigrationWarning >
Lots of changes ahead! Read carefully to see how this release may affect you.

**Two Factor APIs**

Breaking changes. If you use this functionality, please review the API changes and test before upgrading.
The Two-Factor API, two-factor fields on the User and Import User APIs and the Integrations API have changed and are not backwards compatible. If you use this functionality, please review the API changes and test before upgrading.

**Upgrading from &lt; 1.7.0**

If you are upgrading from a version less than 1.7.0, you must do a two stage upgrade. Upgrade to a version greater than or equal to 1.7.0 but less than 1.26.0, then upgrade from that version to 1.26.0. There were internal migration changes which necessitate this two stage process.

**Accessing the admin Login after upgrading:**

The `/` path of FusionAuth no longer automatically forwards to the admin login. To access the admin UI to complete this configuration append `/admin/` to the URL. Once the theme configuration is complete, this root page will contain links to login and instructions on how to utilize this root landing page.
</GeneralMigrationWarning>

<DatabaseMigrationWarning />

### Known Issues
* If you use a non default theme for the FusionAuth default tenant, you may see an error when trying to log in to the admin UI. You can workaround this by appending `?&bypassTheme=true` to your login URL.
  * Resolved in `1.26.1`, see [GitHub Issue #1175](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1175) for additional details.

### Changed

  * See the [Two-Factor](/docs/apis/two-factor) API for more details.
* The Two-Factor Login API now returns `409` for too many attempts. This allows the Two-Factor Login API to provide the same locking capability as the Login API when too many failed attempts occur.
  * See the [Two-Factor Login](/docs/apis/login#complete-multi-factor-authentication) API for more details.
* The Import API has changed for enabling Two-Factor.
  *  See the [User Import](/docs/apis/users#import-users) API for changes.
* The User API has changed for enabling and disabling Two-Factor. See the [User](/docs/apis/users) API for changes.
  * See the [User](/docs/apis/users) API for changes.
* Email and SMS Two-Factor methods will now require a paid edition of FusionAuth. [Learn more about paid editions](/pricing).
  * If you are only using Authenticator/TOTP for Two-Factor, this functionality will continue to work properly in the community edition.
* If you are upgrading from a version less than 1.7.0, you must do a two stage upgrade. Upgrade to a version greater than or equal to 1.7.0 but less than 1.26.0, then upgrade from that version to 1.26.0. There were internal migration changes which necessitate this two stage process.

<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.25.0" releaseDate="March 10th, 2021" />


<GeneralMigrationWarning warning_message="SAML v2 Logout is now fully supported. No action should be required. If you are currently using FusionAuth as a SAML v2 IdP, please verify your configuration as you may want to provide additional configuration to take full advantage of the SAML v2 Logout configuration.

The additional of SAML v2 Logout means there is a new themed page to manage the user experience for SAML v2 Logout. Please review your theme to ensure your user experience is not interrupted. See additional details in the New section below." />

### Changed
* In support of the SAML v2 Logout feature, the following theme changes have been made.
  * New themed template `SAMLv2 logout template`. This template will be rendered when you utilize the SAML v2 Logout feature, it is nearly identical to the existing OAuth2 logout themed page. If you are using themes, please review your theme to ensure your user experience is not interrupted.

### Fixed
* If you are using Elasticsearch version 6 you may encounter an error when using the Search API. This is due to a change in how we optionally request the document hit count in the search request to Elasticsearch. The change is not compatible with Elasticsearch version 6. As a work around, you can set `accurateTotal=true` in the API request. See the [User Search](/docs/apis/users#search-for-users) API for additional details on using this parameter.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1135](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1135)
* Using the HTTP `PATCH` method on the FusionAuth application may produce erroneous validation errors.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1110](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1110)
* Adding additional Java options in the configuration file when the value contains a space may not work correctly.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1065](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1065)
* A `NullPointerException` may occur when you have users registered for an application in a non default tenant and you create a login report for only that application. Thanks to [@NikolayMetchev](https://github.com/NikolayMetchev) for filing this.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1115](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1115)
* When you omit the `state` parameter on the Authorization request, you may receive a `state` parameter on the `redirect_uri` that you did not expect.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1113](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1113)

### New
* Add full support for SAML v2 Logout
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1137](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1137)

### Enhancements
* Add a button to the Sessions tab in the FusionAuth admin UI to delete all user sessions at once, this action is also available from the drop down action list when managing a user.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1094](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1094)
* Add Debug to OAuth2 grants, this will primarily assist in debugging the Authorization Code grant auth code exchange with the Token endpoint.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #781](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/781)
* Add CORS Debug, this will assist you in debugging CORS related `403` HTTP status codes.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1126](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1126)
* Better SMTP debug for specific scenarios. This should assist with async connection issues and provide context to the tenant and template being rendered during the exception.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1064](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1064)
* Allow the Registration API to accept the `applicationId` as a URL segment
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1127](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1127)
* Twitter IdP Login API can optionally accept an access token. When building your own login page, if you complete the initial step with Twitter and utilize the `oauth_verifier` to perform some initial processing of the Twitter user, you may now still send the access token in the form of `oauth_token` and `oauth_token_secret` to FusionAuth to complete the login. This is done by omitting the `oauth_verifier` on the Login request. See [Complete the Twitter Login](/docs/apis/identity-providers/twitter#complete-the-twitter-login) for additional information.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1073](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1073)
* When Key Master generates a `kid` because one is not provided on the request, if there is a public key, generate the `kid` as a JWK thumbprint instead of a randomly generated value.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1136](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1136)
* When using the Search feature in the FusionAuth admin UI, once you begin searching using a specific term or any of the advanced controls, the pagination result total will be an accurate representation of the number of matches returned by Elasticsearch. When no search criteria is provided, the number of matches will cap at the default value of 10,000 and the pagination results will indicate 10,000+ which means at least 10,000 users match the search criteria.

### Internal
* Upgrade Tomcat from version `8.5.57` to `8.5.63`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1119](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1119)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.24.0" releaseDate="February 11th, 2021" />

### Known Issues
* If you are using Elasticsearch version 6 you may encounter an error when using the Search API. This is due to a change in how we optionally request the document hit count in the search request to Elasticsearch. The change is not compatible with Elasticsearch version 6. As a work around, you can set `accurateTotal=true` in the API request.
  * Resolved in `1.25.0`, see [GitHub Issue #1135](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1135) for additional details.

### Security
* More consistent usage of the `Cache-Control` HTTP response header. The default for all pages will be `Cache-Control: no-cache`, and some pages that may contain potentially sensitive information such as the API key add, edit or index pages will use a `Cache-Control: no-store`. No known vulnerability exists with the previous behavior, this is just a proactive change to limit the possible mis-use of cached pages in the FusionAuth admin UI.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1103](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1103)
* A vulnerability in an underlying SAML v2 library was resolved. If you are using SAML please upgrade FusionAuth to 1.24.0 or later as soon as possible.
  * [CVE-2021-27736](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-27736)
  * [CSNC-2021-004](https://www.compass-security.com/fileadmin/Research/Advisories/2021-03_CSNC-2021-004_FusionAuth_SAML_Library_XML_External_Entity.txt)

### Changed

* The `applicationId` and `roles` claims are no longer returned in the `id_token` issued when requesting the `openid` scope. The `id_token` should not be used for authorization, this change makes it less likely to mis-use this token. If you have a requirement for these claims (you shouldn't), you can add them back by using a JWT Populate lambda. See [Id Token claims](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/tokens#id-token) for additional information.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1102](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1102)

### Fixed
* When using the Add or Edit Identity Provider forms in the admin UI, if you have ~2,000 or more applications it is possible for the form request to be truncated by the underlying application server. This error is caused by the maximum number of request parameters being exceeded. This form in particular, along with the Group Add/Edit and Webhook Add/Edit contains a number of fields that is a function of the number of applications configured. An informational error may be written to the system log indicating this truncation has occurred, but no hard error would have occurred. The symptom will be that depending upon your configuration, a portion of it may be lost during this form submit. The entry in the log will contain this message `org.apache.tomcat.util.http.Parameters.processParameters More than the maximum number of request parameters (GET plus POST) for a single request ([10,000]) were detected. Any parameters beyond this limit have been ignored.`.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1057](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1057)
* When you have registered a custom plugin for password hashing, using the View Tenant dialog may fail to render.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1063](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1063)
* Unable to remove a User from a Group using the admin UI dialog. This was a regression issue introduced in version 1.23.0.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1081](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1081)
* If a user was not currently in the Elasticsearch index, the user delete request may fail.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1088](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1088)
* The JWT returned from the Register API when you are creating a User and a Registration in one request may not contain the `roles` claim. This occurs when you do not assign the roles explicitly on the request, and instead are using default role assignment in the application configuration.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1106](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1106)
* Updating a User that has existing group memberships may no longer be searchable in Elasticsearch by their Group memberships until the next time the user logs into FusionAuth.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1087](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1087)
* A Kafka Producer configuration that contains an equals sign `=` in the property value will fail to parse. This was identified in attempting to configure credentials to connect to CloudKarafka.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1107](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1107), thanks to [@chris-bridges](/community/forum/user/chris-bridges) for letting us know!

### Enhancements
* Support a Kickstart file with only a `licenseId`. Previously at least one API key was required because the intent of Kickstart is to call one or more APIs. While there is not a very practical use case for only providing a `licenseId` and no API requests,  this minimal configuration will no longer fail indicating an API key is required. See [Set your License Id](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/kickstart#set-your-license-id) in the [Kickstart](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/kickstart) documentation.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1080](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1080)
* You may now import an RSA certificate with a key bit length less than `2048` into Key Master. The minimum supported RSA key length for signing a JWT is `2048`, so this was previously the minimum requirement to import anything into Key Master. However, we have several configurations now that require a certificate that is only used to verify a signature from a third party. In these cases, we are not using the certificate to sign anything, and [@trevorr](https://github.com/trevorr) rightly pointed out that we should allow smaller keys to be imported to support these use cases. Thank you for the (now obvious) insight! We really appreciate our community members that provide us value for value.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1085](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1085) & [GitHub Issue #1091](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1091)
* Added an additional Search API parameter to allow you to obtain the actual hit count from Elasticsearch. For performance reasons, the default behavior of an Elasticsearch query is to limit the hit count to 10,000. This means that if your query matched more than 10,000 records, the API response will only indicate that at least 10,000 records matched. This is very adequate for pagination purposes, or general queries. There are times where you are building a very specific query and the intent is to identify an accurate number of matching records. You may now provide an additional parameter to the search request named `accurateTotal` which will then return an accurate hit count on the API response. See the [User Search](/docs/apis/users#search-for-users) API for additional details.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1086](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1086)
* Allow the user to click on the Enabled column in the Webhook event configuration in the Webhook and Tenant configurations to enable or disable all events at once. This is just a usability enhancement to save you from clicking over and over. You're welcome.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1093](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1093)
* For pages with potentially a lot of items such as Applications, Tenants, etc - that do not currently have pagination, add a count at the bottom of the panel. This allows you to look smart by knowing how many "things" you have without having to count them yourself.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1104](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1104)

### Internal
* Some enhancements to JavaScript event handlers to perform better on pages with 2-3k+ applications. Pretty boring.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1105](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1105)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.23.3" releaseDate="January 21th, 2021" />

### Fixed
* A tenant delete request may fail. See details in the linked GH issue for a work around. This issue was introduced in version 1.22.0.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1075](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1075)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.23.2" releaseDate="January 20th, 2021" />

### Fixed
* A bug in the PostgreSQL migration will cause you to lose your SAML v2 IdP configuration. If you are using MySQL or you are not using the SAML v2 IdP configuration, this bug will not affect you. The issue was introduced in version 1.21.0, so if you are upgrading from a version prior to 1.21.0 to 1.23.2 you will not be affected. If you have already upgraded to 1.21.0 or any version greater than 1.21.0 prior to this patch, you will have already encountered the issue. If you do encounter this issue, you will need to update the SAML v2 IdP configuration found in each affected Application configuration.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1074](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1074)


<ReleaseNoteHeading version="1.23.1" releaseDate="January 13th, 2021" />

### Fixed
* When configured to sign the SAML v2 AuthN requests to the SAML v2 IdP, the SAML v2 SP metadata does not correctly reflect this settings. The attribute `AuthnRequestsSigned` should now reflect the signing configuration.
  * When configured to sign requests, the SP metadata response will now also contain the KeyDescriptor element to describe the X.509 certificate used to verify the signature.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1067](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1067)

### Known Issues
* If you are upgrading to this version, are using PostgreSQL, and you intend to use the provided LinkedIn Reconcile lambda, you will need to make a small adjustment prior to using it.
  * Navigate to <strong>Customizations -> Lambdas</strong> and edit the lambda named `Default LinkedIn Reconcile provided by FusionAuth` and click edit. You will see an error indicated by a red dot on line `23` of the function body. To fix this error, delete the two empty lines between the end of line `23` and `25`, once the error indicator is gone, save the lambda.
* Unable to remove a User from a group using the admin UI dialog.
  * Fixed in version 1.24.0 via [GitHub Issue #1081](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1081)

  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #991](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/991), thanks to [@hkolbeck-streem](https://github.com/hkolbeck-streem) for the report!
* The IP address shown on the About panel may be the same for each node when viewed on a multi-node FusionAuth instance. This address is shown for informational purposes and was only a cosmetic defect w/out any functional issues.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1030](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1030)
* The SAML Response XML was failing XSD validation for the `Signature` element location when the request was not successful, or FusionAuth was configured to sign the response instead of the assertion.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1047](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1047), thanks to [@MrChrisRodriguez](https://github.com/MrChrisRodriguez) for the excellent report!
* Fix a possible NPE when making an Update request to a group in a multi-tenant environment. With this fix, the correct API response will be returned.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1052](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1052), thanks to [@atrauzzi](https://github.com/atrauzzi) for the report!
* When creating an IdP from the API for Google, Facebook, Twitter, or HYPR - the API was allowing an Id to be provided. Each of these IdP types of which only one are allowed, have a fixed Id that is managed by FusionAuth. The API should ignore the requested Id and set the correct Id instead. If you encounter this issue, the work around is to omit the Id on the API request.
  * Resolves [GitHub Issue #1058](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1058)
* Kickstart fails when using a variable in the `tenantId` field for an API key.
