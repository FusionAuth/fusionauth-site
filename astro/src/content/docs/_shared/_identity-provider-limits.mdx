Some Identity Providers, such as the Google and OIDC Identity Providers, request access tokens from a configured remote URL. Remote servers must respond within a certain time frame or the login workflow will fail. The limit is currently 10 seconds. It is not configurable.

Managed domains can only be used with OIDC and SAMLv2 Identity Providers.

FusionAuth's hosted login pages only support a single Google identity provider configuration using Google's GSI client at a time, which provides a more modern experience and One Tap support. See [Google identity provider limitations](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/identity-providers/social/google#limitations) for more information.
