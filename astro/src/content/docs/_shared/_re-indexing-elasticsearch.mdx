<Aside type="caution">
Reindexing is an expensive operation, especially if your system has a large number of users, so it should not be run unless necessary.
</Aside>

It is possible, though rare, for an Elasticsearch index to become out of sync with the database. If you stand up FusionAuth with a database dump and restore or import users using the [User Import API](/docs/apis/users#import-users), you may need to run this operation. You may also be instructed to do so by FusionAuth support.

In general, even if a temporary outage occurs with Elasticsearch, the index will be sync up automatically.


If you do need to run this, navigate to <Breadcrumb>System -> Reindex</Breadcrumb> in the FusionAuth admin UI to initiate a reindex of all users. This navigation item will only be displayed when the search engine is Elasticsearch.

Optionally, you can also reindex via API.
