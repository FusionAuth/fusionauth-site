While there is underlying support for different code lengths, algorithms and time steps, at the current time the system only allows for the following TOTP settings:

| Configuration setting      | Currently allowed value |
|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| `authenticator.algorithm`  | `HmacSHA1`              |
| `authenticator.codeLength` | `6`                     |
| `authenticator.timeStep`   | `30`                    |

Any attempt to change these configuration values will currently be ignored. If you need different configuration settings, please file a [GitHub issue detailing your use case](https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-issues/issues).
