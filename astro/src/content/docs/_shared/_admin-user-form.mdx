This form is what you see when you are adding or editing a user in the admin UI. This is configurable at the Tenant level.

If you need to capture and validate custom data, you can do so by creating a form field, by navigating to <Breadcrumb>Customizations -> Form Fields</Breadcrumb>. You should create any needed fields before you create a form. Otherwise you can use the standard form fields.

Create a form, by navigating to <Breadcrumb>Customizations -> Forms</Breadcrumb>. Select <InlineUIElement>Admin User</InlineUIElement> as the type. Add the needed sections and fields.

You should modify your theme to add labels for these custom fields for proper display in the admin UI. For example, if you added a field stored in `user.data.favoriteColor`, you'd add the following key to the messages file of your theme to add a label of `Favorite Color` to the field in the admin UI.

```
user.data.favoriteColor=Favorite Color
```

This field is not localizable, so you'll only need to modify the default messages file. [Learn more about modifying the messages file in your theme](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/localization#messages).

Configure the FusionAuth admin UI to use these forms by navigating to <Breadcrumb>Tenants -> Your Tenant -> General</Breadcrumb> and then to the <Breadcrumb>Form settings</Breadcrumb> section. Set the <InlineField>Admin user form</InlineField> field to your new form.

Learn more in the [Tenant documentation](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/tenants#general).
