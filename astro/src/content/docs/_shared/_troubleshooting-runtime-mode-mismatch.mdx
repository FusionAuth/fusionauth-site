If you see a message in your system log like this:

```
Node [node] cannot be added. The runtime mode is [Development] and this node in [Production] mode.
```

This means that you have a runtime mode mismatch. All nodes of a FusionAuth cluster must be running in the same mode, either `Production` or `Development`.

To fix this, shut down all FusionAuth nodes, whether they are in a container or a process. Then restart them.
