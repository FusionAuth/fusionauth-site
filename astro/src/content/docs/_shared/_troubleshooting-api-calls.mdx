When your API call isn't working, taking the following steps can help you troubleshoot it.

Use the REST API directly. While the client libraries are useful abstractions, removing them helps narrow down the issues. Curl or wget are great choices.

When using a command line tool like curl, make sure you set the headers appropriately. These headers are commonly forgotten:

* `Authorization`: the API key in most cases. Review the [API Authentication](/docs/apis/authentication) documentation for more information.
* `Content-type`: this is almost always `application/json` for any call which is not a `GET` request. This header can be omitted for a `GET` request. If you don't specify this header when making a non-`GET` API call, you will see an unexpected error.
* `X-FusionAuth-TenantId`: only required when you have two or more tenants and the tenant cannot be inferred from the request or API key. However, you can always provide this header.

Additionally, it can be helpful to copy and paste the JSON body from the documentation for the call you are trying to debug.

If you are seeing a `401` error, confirm that the API key has the required permissions. Test with a 'super user' key to ensure you have the headers and body correct.

Ensure you are making requests to the correct host and that your proxy, if using one, passes API requests correctly. When troubleshooting, call the FusionAuth instance directly if possible. This removes the proxy, yet another possible source of issues.
