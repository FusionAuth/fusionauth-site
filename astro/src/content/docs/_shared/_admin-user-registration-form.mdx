This form is what you see when you are adding or editing a user registration to an application using the admin UI. This is configurable at the Application level.

If you need to capture and validate custom data, you can do so by creating a form field, by navigating to <strong>Customizations -> Form Fields</strong>. You should create any needed fields before you create a form. Otherwise you can use the standard form fields.

Create a form, by navigating to <strong>Customizations -> Forms</strong>. Select <InlineUIElement>Admin Registration</InlineUIElement> as the type. Add the needed sections and fields.

Then, configure the FusionAuth admin UI to use these forms by navigating to <strong>Applications -> Your Application -> Registration</strong> and then to the <strong>Form settings</strong> section. Set the <InlineField>Admin Registration</InlineField> field to your new form.
