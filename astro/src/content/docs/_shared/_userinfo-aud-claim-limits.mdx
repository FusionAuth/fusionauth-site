In version `1.50.0` and later, the `aud` claim is required for all tokens. The `aud` claim value, or the first value in the case where the claim contains a list, must correspond to an active Application.

If you have a token that was not obtained from an OAuth flow and does not contain the `aud` claim, consider adding the claim or using the [JWT Validate API](/docs/apis/jwt#validate-a-jwt) instead.
