## Overview

The account portal is where you can manage your account data, deployments and licenses.
The portal is distinct from your FusionAuth instance, which is where your user data lives.
While an instance can be self-hosted or hosted in FusionAuth Cloud, the account portal is an internet accessible web application.

<Aside type="note">
You can self-host FusionAuth running the Community plan for your user datastore without ever setting up an account with the FusionAuth portal.

If you use FusionAuth Cloud or have a licensed plan with advanced features, you need a FusionAuth portal account.

If you no longer want to pay for a plan, change it to the Community plan here by clicking on the <InlineField>Change Plan</InlineField> button.

Learn more about [plans](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/plans-features) and [licensing](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/licensing).

### Deployments

The <strong>Deployments</strong> tab is where you can create deployments in FusionAuth Cloud.
These are managed instances of FusionAuth, where the FusionAuth team manages the operational concerns of your FusionAuth instance.

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/download-and-install/deployments-tab.png" alt="The deployments tab." width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

Learn more about [deployments](/docs/get-started/run-in-the-cloud/cloud).



### Users

You can add, modify and remove users from your FusionAuth account.
Users added this way can log in to account.fusionauth.io and access information about your FusionAuth deployments, plan, licenses and more.

<CloudUserNote />

You can see users who have access to your account.
Users must have an email address.

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/download-and-install/users-list.png" alt="List the users with access to your account." width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

Add users to your account.
You can have unlimited users in your FusionAuth account portal.
If you have more than one FusionAuth account, users can belong to multiple accounts.

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/download-and-install/users-list-add.png" alt="The add button to add users to your account." width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

As well as adding a new user, you can also modify an existing user.
You can change their name, email address and roles.

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/download-and-install/users-edit.png" alt="Edit a user." width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

Users can have zero or more roles.
Each role controls access to functionality within the portal.

* Billing manager: view invoices, manage payment methods
* Deployment manager: view and manage deployments
* Plan manager: view and manage your plan
* Admin: access to all functionality of the roles above
* Security officer: will be notified of any security updates

### Billing

The <strong>Billing</strong> tab is where you can update your billing information and view invoices.
This tab is only useful if you are using a credit card to pay for your FusionAuth plan or deployments.

On this tab, view and modify aspects of your billing.
There's an overview of your billing status.

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/download-and-install/billing-overview.png" alt="The overview section of the billing tab." width="1200" role="bottom-cropped." />

You can update your payment methods with a different credit card.
FusionAuth stores no credit card data internally; it all is stored in an external third party provider.

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/download-and-install/billing-update-card.png" alt="The payment method update section of the billing tab." width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

You can update current payment settings, including:

* the name on the invoice
* the tax identifier on the invoice
* the email address to which invoices are sent

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/download-and-install/billing-update-detail.png" alt="The payment method details section of the billing tab." width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

You can view past invoices.
This can be useful when accounting is curious about a past bill.
No more filing a support ticket to see the invoice from six months ago!
