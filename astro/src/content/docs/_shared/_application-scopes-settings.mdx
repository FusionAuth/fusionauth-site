<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Relationship">
    The application's relationship to the OAuth server.

    The possible values are:

    * `First-party` - The application has the same owner as the authorization server. Consent to requested OAuth scopes is granted implicitly.
    * `Third-party` - The application is external to the authorization server. Users will be prompted to consent to requested OAuth scopes based on <InlineField>Consent mode</InlineField>.

    <AdvancedEditionBlurbApi feature="third-party applications"/>
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Consent mode">
    Controls the policy for prompting a user to consent to requested OAuth scopes. This field is only visible when the application's <InlineField>Relationship</InlineField> is `Third-party`.

    The possible values are:

    * `Always prompt` - Users are prompted to consent to requested OAuth scopes every time they go through an OAuth workflow.
    * `Remember decision` - The user's consent selections will be persisted, and they will only be prompted when the OAuth request contains a scope they have not made a selection for. The duration of this persisted choice is controlled by the tenant's <InlineField>Remember OAuth scope consent choice</InlineField> configuration.
    * `Never prompt` - The user will be never be prompted to consent to requested OAuth scopes. Permission will be granted implicitly as if this were a `First-party` application. This configuration is meant for testing purposes only.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Unknown scope policy">
    Controls the policy for handling unknown scopes on an OAuth request.

    The possible values are:

    * `Allow` - Unknown scopes will be allowed on the request, passed through the OAuth workflow, and written to the resulting tokens without consent. This is the legacy behavior.
    * `Remove` - Unknown scopes will be removed from the OAuth workflow, but the workflow will proceed without them.
    * `Reject` - Unknown scopes will be rejected and cause the OAuth workflow to fail with an error. This is the default behavior for new applications.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Scope handling policy">
    Controls the policy for handling of OAuth scopes when populating JWTs and the UserInfo response.

    The possible values are:

    * `Compatibility` - OAuth workflows will populate JWT and UserInfo claims in a backwards compatible manner.
    * `Strict` - OAuth workflows will populate JWT and UserInfo claims according to specification based on requested and consented scopes.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Provided scopes">
    Configuration for standard scopes provided by FusionAuth. Each provided scope is reserved by FusionAuth and can be individually <InlineField>Enabled</InlineField> and <InlineField>Required</InlineField>. A disabled scope will be treated as unknown by FusionAuth. A user must consent to all <InlineField>Required</InlineField> scopes present in an OAuth workflow.
  </APIField>
