The RAM required by Elasticsearch or OpenSearch depends on your login volume and user/entity counts. If you expect to have a few logins per minute and only a few thousand users/entities, `1GB-2GB` of RAM will be sufficient. If you have more users/entities as well as logins, please size up accordingly. We recommend running load tests of FusionAuth to help determine the amount of RAM that is required for your needs.
