If you are building your own login experience, you'll want to start the identity provider flow yourself and then complete the login. 
</p>

<p>
You might do this if you are using the <a href="/docs/v1/tech/apis/login">Login API</a> rather than using the hosted FusionAuth login pages.
</p>

<p>
  Completing the login is <a href={apiRef}>documented further in the API</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you require a refresh token after completing the login, ensure <InlineField>Enable JWT Refresh</InlineField> is <code>true</code> in the application configuration. This is found in the administrative user interface by navigating to <strong>Applications -> Your Application -> Security -> Login API settings</strong>.
