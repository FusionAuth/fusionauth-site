FusionAuth will always have a powerful, full featured free-to-use Community plan.
This is the foundation of FusionAuth and the community surrounding it and as an organization FusionAuth is committed to improving the Community plan, with both features and bug fixes.

However, there are additional tiers of functionality which meet the needs of different types of organizations and offer premium features.
For these plans, a license is required.

You can learn more about purchasing FusionAuth plans other than Community on the [pricing page](/pricing).
The legal agreement you make when using FusionAuth, with or without a paid plan, is [the FusionAuth license](/license).
Learn more about the license in [the licensing FAQ](/license-faq).
