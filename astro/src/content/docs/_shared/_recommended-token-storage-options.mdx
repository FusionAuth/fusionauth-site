* **Cookie**: send the token down to the browser as a `Secure`, `HttpOnly` cookie. If you don't require cross-site cookie sharing, set `SameSite` to `Strict`. Otherwise, set `SameSite` to `Lax`, which will share the cookies in certain situations. Learn more about [`SameSite` settings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite).
* **BFF/Server-side Session**: store the token server side, in a session. This is also known as the "backend for frontend" or BFF pattern. The session is typically managed by a framework, and ideally adheres to the same cookie storage recommendations. Learn more about [server-side sessions](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html). Please consult your framework documentation around securing sessions and data in sessions.
* **Native Secure Storage**: when the client is a native mobile app, store the token in a secure storage area such as iOS Keychain or Android Keystore.

Here is a table of characteristics of recommended JWT storage options.

| Feature                                              | Cookie                                               | BFF/Server-side Session        | Native Secure Storage          |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Scalable client API requests                         | Yes                                                  | No                             | Yes |
| Revocation possible                                  | [Yes](/learn/expert-advice/tokens/revoking-jwts)     | Yes                            | Yes |
| Revocation straightforward                           | No                                                   | Yes                            | No  |
| Sticky sessions or session datastore required        | No                                                   | Yes                            | No  |
| Token sent on HTTP API requests automatically        | Yes (you may need to tweak the `credentials` option) | No                             | No  |
| Token can be presented to APIs on other domains      | No                                                   | Yes (via server-side requests) | Yes |
| Works in a web browser                               | No                                                   | Yes                            | No  |

The proper JWT storage choice is based on your threat modeling and how much risk a particular service can tolerate. You can also configure your JWTs to be short lived, which minimizes the amount of time a stolen JWT can be used.

If you need to lock down JWTs further, implement [token sidejacking protection](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/JSON_Web_Token_for_Java_Cheat_Sheet.html#token-sidejacking) using cookies and a nonce. An alternative is [DPoP](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1679), an open feature request for FusionAuth.
