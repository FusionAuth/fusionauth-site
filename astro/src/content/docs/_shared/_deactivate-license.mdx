You may need to deactivate your license, such as when you rotate your license key or change your plan. To do so:

* Navigate to the <Breadcrumb>Reactor</Breadcrumb> tab in the FusionAuth admin UI of your instance.
* Click the red <InlineUIElement>Deactivate</InlineUIElement> button in the upper right hand corner.

![How to deactivate your current license.](/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/reactor-activated-decommission.png)

Deactivating your license disables [premium functionality](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/premium-features) for the associated instance. This includes both using and managing that functionality. Any saved configurations aren't removed when the license is deactivated.

Deactivating a license affects only the specific instance. For example, you're running two instances of FusionAuth with the same license, one in Frankfurt, Germany and another in Iowa, USA. When you deactivate the instance in Frankfurt, the one in Iowa continues running with premium functionality.

For example, you enable SMS Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) after activating the license for your tenant. Then, several users add MFA to their accounts. After deactivating your license:

* Users can't enable SMS MFA on their accounts.
* When logging in, users aren't prompted for a texted code.
* Administrators can't activate additional premium MFA methods.

Reactivating your license restores the ability of users to add MFA, the MFA check at login, and the ability of administrators to add other premium methods.
