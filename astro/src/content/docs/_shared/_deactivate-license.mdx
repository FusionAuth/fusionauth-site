You may need to deactivate your license, such as when you rotate your license key or change your plan. To do so:

* Navigate to the <Breadcrumb>Reactor</Breadcrumb> tab in the FusionAuth admin UI of your instance.
* Click the red <InlineUIElement>Deactivate</InlineUIElement> button in the upper right hand corner.

![How to deactivate your current license.](/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/reactor-activated-decommission.png)

Deactivating your license will disable any [premium functionality](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/premium-features) for this instance. This includes both the ability of users to access such functionality and the ability of admins to configure it. However, deactivating your license does not remove configuration saved while the license was active.

<Aside type="note">
Deactivating a license does not affect other FusionAuth instances using that license. For example, if you have an instance running in Frankfurt, Germany and an instance running in Iowa, USA both using the same license, deactivating the license for the Frankfurt instance will not affect the Iowa instance.

For example, suppose you activate your license and enable SMS Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for your tenant. A number of registered users then add MFA to their accounts. After some time you deactivate your license. Until you reactivate your license:

* Users aren't able to add MFA to their accounts
* Users who added MFA are no longer prompted for the additional factor, though they are still able to log in.
* Administrators are unable to enable any other MFA methods on any tenants.

Reactivating your license restores the ability of users to add MFA, the MFA check at login, and the ability of administrators to add other methods.
