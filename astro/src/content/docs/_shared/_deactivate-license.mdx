You may need to deactivate your license, such as when you rotate your license key or change your plan. To do so:

* Navigate to the <Breadcrumb>Reactor</Breadcrumb> tab in the FusionAuth admin UI of your instance.
* Click the red <InlineUIElement>Deactivate</InlineUIElement> button in the upper right hand corner.

![How to deactivate your current license.](/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/reactor-activated-decommission.png)

Deactivating your license disables [premium functionality](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/premium-features) for the associated instance. This includes the use and configuration of that functionality. However, deactivating your license doesn't remove existing saved configurations.

<Aside type="note">
Deactivating a license does not affect other FusionAuth instances using that license. For example, if you have an instance running in Frankfurt, Germany and an instance running in Iowa, USA both using the same license, deactivating the license for the Frankfurt instance will not affect the Iowa instance.

For example, you enable SMS Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) after activating the license for your tenant. Then a number of registered users add MFA to their accounts. After deactivating your license:

* Users can't enable SMS MFA on their accounts.
* When logging in, users won't be prompted for a texted code.
* Administrators are unable to enable any other premium MFA methods.

Reactivating your license restores the ability of users to add MFA, the MFA check at login, and the ability of administrators to add other premium methods.
