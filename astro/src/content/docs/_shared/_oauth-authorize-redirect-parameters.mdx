    The [locale](/docs/reference/data-types#locales) that was to render the login page, or a previously selected locale by the user during a previous session. This may be useful to know in your own application so you can continue to localize the interface for the language the user selected while on the FusionAuth login page. See the [Theme Localization](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/localization) documentation for more information.
  </APIField>
