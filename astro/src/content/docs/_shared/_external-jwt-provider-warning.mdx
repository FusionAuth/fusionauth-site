<Aside type="caution">
This external JWT Identity Provider flow is not compatible with the hosted login pages.  This integration is accessible through our API only.

Additionally, if you are integrating with any of the identity providers for which there is a provided Identity Provider integration (whether specific like Facebook or generic like OIDC), prefer those options over this provider.

In general, you should use the `/api/identity-provider/login` endpoint of another Identity Provider rather than the External JWT provider if one is available.
