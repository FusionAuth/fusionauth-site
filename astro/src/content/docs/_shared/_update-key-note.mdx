Only the name of the Key may be changed; all other fields will remain the same. If you need to update a Key with a new certificate, algorithm or other attributes, please [Import a Key](/docs/apis/keys#import-a-key).

For example, if you have a Key with an associated expiring certificate, you'll need to follow the steps similar to those outlined in the [JWT signing key rotation documentation](/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/key-rotation#jwt-signing-key-rotation):

* Import this key, keypair or certificate into FusionAuth. This will create a new Key entity in FusionAuth.
* Update the appropriate configuration with this new Key (JWT signing configuration, SAML validation configuration, etc).
* Once the new Key is configured for use, remove the expired, previous Key. 

Note that validation rules will prevent you from removing an in-use key.
