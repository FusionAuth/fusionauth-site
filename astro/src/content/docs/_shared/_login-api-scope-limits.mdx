The [login API](/docs/apis/login) does not accept the OAuth `scope` parameter as it is not part of an OAuth workflow. If your application requires the OAuth `scope` parameter to be present in the JWT, it can be added with the [JWT Populate](/docs/extend/code/lambdas/jwt-populate) lambda.

You're responsible for building the user interface to prompt users for consent to the requested scopes and capturing their response.
