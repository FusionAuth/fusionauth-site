  <APIField name="applicationId" type="UUID">
    The unique Id of the Application for which the user has been authenticated. A JWT can only represent authorization to a single Application.

    This claim is only present if the user has a registration to the Application.

    To obtain a JWT for another Application you must either authenticate again with a different `applicationId` using the [Authentication](/docs/apis/login#authenticate-a-user) API or utilize the [Issue a JWT](/docs/apis/jwt#issue-a-jwt) API to exchange a valid JWT for another.
