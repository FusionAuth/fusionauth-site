You might be wondering, what is the difference between multi-factor authentication and two factor authentication.

A factor is anything a user has, is, or can provide which can uniquely identify the user. A password which historically has been used to identify and authenticate a user is flawed in that it is likely not globally unique, and it can be assumed that eventually it will be known by more than one person. Additional factors can be used to authenticate a user to mitigate the limitations of the traditional password.

When a system can support more than one method of authentication, it is considered to support multiple factors, or MFA. In addition to password authentication, FusionAuth supports a time based one time password, also referred to as TOTP, and an SMS or Email based one time use code. This means FusionAuth supports multiple factor authentication, or MFA.

Two-factor authentication, or 2FA more specifically refers to the practice of requiring two factors of authentication to complete a login request. In practice, this usually means requiring a password, and one additional factor of authentication.
