When you enable self-service registration for an application and a user who does not have a registration for that application successfully logs in to that application, the user will automatically be registered for that application, and have a registration added.

Let's walk through a scenario. Suppose you have three applications:

* Hooli Jobs
* Pied Piper Video Chat, which has self-service registration enabled
* Pied Piper Email Service, which **does not** have self-service registration enabled

User `richard@piedpiper.com` has a valid account, and has a registration for the Hooli Jobs.

When Richard tries to log into Pied Piper Video Chat, he is able to log in. He is automatically registered for this application, since self service registration is turned on for it. Therefore the `applicationId` claim is present in the token and any default roles are associated with his account.

When Richard tries to log into Pied Piper Email Service, he is able to log in, since he has a valid account in the tenant. But Richard is not registered for the application. Therefore no roles are associated with him and the `applicationId` claim is not present.
