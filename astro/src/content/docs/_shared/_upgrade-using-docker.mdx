To upgrade FusionAuth when running with `docker compose`:

1. Stop the instance: `docker compose down`.
2. Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to point to the version of FusionAuth you want. You can see [available tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/fusionauth/fusionauth-app).
3. Start it up: `docker compose up -d`.
4. Log in to the administrative UI.
