To upgrade FusionAuth when running with `docker compose`:

1. Stop the instance: `docker compose down`.
2. Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to point to the version of FusionAuth you want. You can see [available tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/fusionauth/fusionauth-app). To upgrade to the latest version, run: `docker pull fusionauth/fusionauth-app:latest` (see [Docker Tags](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/docker#docker-tags) for more information on the `latest` tag).
3. Start it up: `docker compose up -d`.
4. Log in to the administrative UI.
