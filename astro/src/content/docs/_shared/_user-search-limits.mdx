You cannot filter search results in FusionAuth to only return certain fields. Instead you must do this through post-processing. So if you want to retrieve only the `firstName` and <InlineField>birthDate</InlineField> fields of a set of users, the results will give you each entire user object and you must select desired fields. You can use the JSON processing facilities in your chosen language to do so, or use a tool such as [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

Prior to version 1.48.0, when using the Elasticsearch search engine, the maximum number of users returned for any search is 10,000 users. For versions 1.48.0 and later, there is no limit on the number of users which can be returned if you paginate through the results.

There are no latency guarantees around the indexing of user data in Elasticsearch after the user has been updated using the API. The Elasticsearch index is eventually consistent.

The duration between an Update User API call and the changed attributes appearing in a search request would be the time it takes FusionAuth to make the request to Elasticsearch added to the time for Elasticsearch to refresh the index and make it visible to search.

The time it takes to [expose index changes to searches in Elasticsearch is called the `refresh_interval`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules.html#index-refresh-interval-setting). This value defaults to one second, so that is the minimum practical delay.
