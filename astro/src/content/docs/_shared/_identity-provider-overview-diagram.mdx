Here's a diagram of the login flow between:

* the user
* your application
* FusionAuth and
* a remote identity provider


```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User/Browser
    participant App
    participant FusionAuth
    participant IdentityProvider as Provider

    User ->> App : View Initial Page<br/>Click Login
    App ->> User : Displays Login Page<br/>Including Link To 'Login With Provider'
    User ->> App : Clicks On 'Login With Provider'
    App ->> User : Redirect To Provider Authorization URL
    User ->> IdentityProvider : Enters Credentials
    IdentityProvider ->> IdentityProvider : Validate Credentials
    IdentityProvider ->> User : Redirect to App With Authorization Code
    User ->> App : Requests Page, Has Authorization Code
    App ->> FusionAuth : Calls Complete Login<br/>With Code And Redirect URI
    FusionAuth ->> IdentityProvider : Exchanges Code And<br/>Redirect URI For Provider Token
    IdentityProvider ->> FusionAuth : Returns Provider Token
    FusionAuth ->> FusionAuth : Stores Provivider Token, Calls Lambda, Creates User And Registrations (If Needed), Generates FusionAuth Tokens
    FusionAuth ->> App : Return FusionAuth Tokens
    App ->> App : Create Session Or<br/>Otherwise Log User In
    Note over User, IdentityProvider: User Is Logged In And App Can Proceed<br/>Delivering Data And Functionality
```

Although this looks complex, the user only sees a few screens, such as the FusionAuth login screen, the provider login screen, and your application.
