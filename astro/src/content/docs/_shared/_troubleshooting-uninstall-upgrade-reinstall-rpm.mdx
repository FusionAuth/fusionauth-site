The following steps will produce a clean installation preserving:

### Manual Removal Steps

1. Remove the RPM package for `fusionauth-search` and `fusionauth-app`
* `sudo rpm -e fusionauth-search`
* `sudo rpm -e fusionauth-app`

2. Manually delete anything leftover from RPM
* `sudo rm -rf /usr/local/fusionauth/fusionauth-search/`
* `sudo rm -rf /usr/local/fusionauth/fusionauth-app/`
* `sudo rm -rf /usr/local/fusionauth/bin/`

3. After removal, the following directories will remain:
* `/usr/local/fusionauth/config/`
* `/usr/local/fusionauth/data/` - In some cases this directory may not exist
* `/usr/local/fusionauth/java/` - While safe to delete, it is not necessary.
