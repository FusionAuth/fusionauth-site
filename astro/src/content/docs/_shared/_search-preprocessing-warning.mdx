<Aside type="caution">
  FusionAuth adds wildcards to unscoped `queryString`s in order to match the broadest set of results. Depending on the specifics of the system, a leading wildcard on a search term can significantly reduce search performance. In order to improve search performance, limit the search to a single field by specifying it in the `queryString` followed by a `:` to prevent the pre-processing by FusionAuth.
