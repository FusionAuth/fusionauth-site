## Overview

Template variables are provided to allow intelligent customization of theme templates. You can use Freemarker to display, hide, or otherwise logically modify what your end users sees based on these values.

Each template has different variables that are available to it. These variables can be used in the template to help with rendering the HTML. There are also a couple of common variables that are available in all of the pages. The common variables and the page specific variables are all listed below.

When the variable is FusionAuth specific, such as the tenant or application, the fields of the variable are the same as the JSON object described in the Retrieve section of the corresponding API documentation.

By default FusionAuth will provide HTML escaping on all values rendered in HTML, this protects you from script injection attacks. If you find a value that is being incorrectly escaped you may need to utilize the FreeMarker built in for no-escape `?no_esc`.

{/*  don't update these variables directly. */}
{/*  update site/_date/templates.yaml (further instructions there) */}
{/*  update the JSON files in site/docs/src/json/themes/ with the new theme template key */}
{/*  touch this file to regenerate (if in dev mode) */}
{/*  that's it. the API and the theme form page will be automatically updated. */}


## Common Variables

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="application" type="Application">
    The application resolved by the provided <InlineField>client_id</InlineField> provided on the request. If the request was made without a <InlineField>client_id</InlineField> then this variable will be undefined. Ensure you reference it using a null safe strategy if you are using some of the themed pages without a <InlineField>client_id</InlineField>.

    See the [Application API](/docs/apis/applications) for details on this object.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="client_id" type="String">
    The OAuth v2.0 `client_id` parameter. This is synonymous with FusionAuth's Application Id.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="currentUser" type="User" since="1.30.0">
    When there is an active SSO session, this variable will contain the currently logged in user. When an SSO session does not yet exist, this variable will be `null`. If the user has not checked the `Keep me signed in` option, there is no SSO session and this variable will be `null`.

    See the [User API](/docs/apis/users) for details on this object.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="errorMessages">
    A list of error messages that were generated during the processing of the request.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="fieldMessages">
    A map of field messages (usually errors) that were generated during the processing of the request. The key into the map is the name of the form field and the value is a list that contains the errors for that form field.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="locale" type="Locale">
    The locale used to localize messages.

    You can find the JavaDoc for this object available here: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Locale.html
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="request" type="HttpServletRequest">
    The HttpServletRequest object that is part of the Java Servlet specification.

    You can find the JavaDoc for this object available here: https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="tenant" type="Tenant">
    The tenant that has been resolved for this template. This value has either been specified on the request by providing the `tenantId` request parameter or it has been resolved by other request parameters such as the `client_id`.

    If you need to customize the look and feel for different tenants but desire to use the same theme to lower maintenance, store values in <InlineField>tenant.data</InlineField>.
    For example, you could set <InlineField>tenant.data.customElements.buttonText</InlineField> and <InlineField>tenant.data.customElements.buttonColor</InlineField>, then retrieve values off these fields in the theme templates.

    See the [Tenant API](/docs/apis/tenants) for details on this object.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="tenantId" type="UUID">
    The unique Tenant identifier, this is equivalent to `tenant.id`.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="theme" type="Theme">
    The theme that has been resolved for this template. This could be resolved based on the tenant or the application.

    See the [Themes API](/docs/apis/themes) for details on this object.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="themeId" type="UUID">
    The unique Theme identifier, this is equivalent to `theme.id`.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

## Template Specific Variables

In addition to the common variables documented above, each template may have additional variables available to that only make sense in the context of this template. For example, the OAuth Authorize page (the login page) can access the `loginId` template variable, but this variable would make no sense on the email verification template.

{/* This displays all the page specific variables, pulled from the src/content/json/themes/templates.json file */}
