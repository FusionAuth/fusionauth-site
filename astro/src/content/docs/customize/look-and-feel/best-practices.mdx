## Overview

While having a decent registration and login page happens by default with FA, it takes a bit more work to create a page that that has excellent usability and accessibility and delights new customers. In this guide you'll learn what you need to check when designing a custom login page for your business, with code examples of how to do it.

## Using Advanced Theming

If you read the [theming overview](http://localhost:3000/docs/customize/look-and-feel), you'll know there are three ways to customize your authentication pages:
- use the [Simple Theme Editor](http://localhost:3000/docs/customize/look-and-feel/simple-theme-editor) to make small changes to one of the default FA themes.
- use the [Advanced Theme Editor](http://localhost:3000/docs/customize/look-and-feel/advanced-theme-editor) to overhaul everything with custom CSS, JS, and the [Java FreeMarker template language](https://freemarker.apache.org/).
- write custom pages in your own app that call the [FA API for authentication](http://localhost:3000/docs/apis/authentication), and don't use the hosted login pages  .

## TODO

fa -> FusionAuth
conversation close https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-site/issues/3053


```sh from dan
Including a sample theme to handle them.

The ideal login and registration page would be

    accessible
    high conversion
    secure
    html5 compatible
    with conversion tracking
    mobile friendly
    looks sharp
    autocomplete where appropriate: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete
```

```sh from gareth
The ideal login and registration page would be
  - accessible - we could highlight some of the most important parts like screenreaders, tab behaviour, font size, colour contrasts? With a demonstration showing that the example fusionauth login page meets them.
  - high conversion - not sure about this one, maybe something about if a user tries to register with the login form then it should automatically move them to the registration flow? And not harrass them like disabling the password paste field or some other examples of crap that enterprises often do
  - secure - probably just a few obvious things like serving over HTTPS and not logging the password
  - html5 compatible - also probably just like 1-2 basic points like using the right labels?
  - with conversion tracking - maybe add posthog free tier to track new sign ups?
  - mobile friendly - looks like the example themes are, so probably just show an example of how it changes when you resize your window
  - looks sharp - probably kinda subjective, I think can skip this one?
  - autocomplete where appropriate: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete - probably some interesting stuff to add here about how to integrate with password managers too.

Hopefully one of those four themes is already quite close or already meets all of these? I think this doesn’t have to be a full on step-by-step replication guide, but it can be used to both

    - Explain to readers that getting a ‘perfect’ registration/login page is more complicated than just two text fields and a button
    - Show how to add the best practices you care about with Fusionauth by showing example snippets from the theme, and screenshots that demonstrate a specific point.
