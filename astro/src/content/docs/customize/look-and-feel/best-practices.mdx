## Overview

While having a decent registration and login page happens by default with FA, it takes a bit more work to create a page that that has excellent usability and accessibility and delights new customers. In this guide you'll learn what you need to check when designing a custom login page for your business, with code examples of how to do it.

## List Of Best Practices For Registration And Login

Let's start by reviewing everything authentication pages should have. In the next section you'll learn how to implement them in FusionAuth.

Registration and login pages should be:

- ⮆ Separate. Both pages could be combined into a single page, after all they both contain just username and password fields. If the user is not yet registered when trying to sign in, why not automatically register them? The main reason is that separate pages avoid users creating duplicate accounts. People frequently forget which email addresses they used to register for a service (especially in recent years with an increased focus on privacy and email aliases), or mistype the address. Telling someone that their username does not exist is clearer than silently creating a new account. You also might want to include extra fields on a registration page, such as checkboxes for consent, which do not belong on a login page. Finally, if you want to protect users' privacy, having separate pages prevents attackers from entering email addresses into a page to see which users are registered for the service already.
- 🧹 Minimal. Registration pages give the user work to do, which discourages them from using your service. Make that work as easy as possible by having pages with no clutter and as few fields to complete as possible.
- 🦯 Accessible. This includes large readable fonts for those with poor eyesight, color-blindness, or dyslexia. Screen readers for the blind. Proper tab order and keyboard support for those who can't use a mouse. Ensure your site works correctly on desktop and mobile. Accessibility also means that users can actually load the page, so be careful with images that are too large, don't exclude those using a VPN, and have a backup host if Cloudflare or AWS crashes due to network configuration. Show translated pages in the language of your users if appropriate.
- 🌐 Standards compliant. This includes HTML5, OAuth 2, and cross-browser compatibility with functions like [autocomplete](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete) and password managers.
- 🔐 Secure. When using FusionAuth, this is the easiest part. The hosted login pages are the result of a company dedicated to a security product and are secure by default. The tricky part is deciding whether to support login with email addresses, usernames, or mobile phones. And whether to use passkeys, single sign-on (SSO) or social login, and two-factor authentication. Each of these choices has security and ease-of-use implications. You need to decide what is best for the majority of your users.
- ⚖️ Legal and ethical. You need to be compliant with GDPR and the Cookie law if your service is available to any European citizen. Put links to privacy and data use policies on your registration page. Include opt-in checkboxes for any personal data collection. Obtain consent for any non-essential cookies. For more information on this complex topic, see the blog articles on [EU laws](todo get link when FA publishes this) and [configuring FusionAuth to comply with GDPR](todo get link when FA publishes this).
- 👁️ Able to collect metrics. Your registration page should track, in a way that doesn't collect personal data, how many people attempt, complete, and abandon registration. If possible, track where users abandon registration to learn what might be discouraging them and what you can improve.
- 🌼 Good looking. A page that is visually well-designed persuades users that your business is successful, professional, and trustworthy. This isn't just about layout and styling. Typography matters, as does your text itself. The language on the page must be clear, grammatically correct, and the tone should match your business. Ensure translations to foreign languages are correct too.

## Using Advanced Theming

If you read the [theming overview](http://localhost:3000/docs/customize/look-and-feel), you'll know there are three ways to customize your authentication pages:
- use the [Simple Theme Editor](http://localhost:3000/docs/customize/look-and-feel/simple-theme-editor) to make small changes to one of the default FA themes.
- use the [Advanced Theme Editor](http://localhost:3000/docs/customize/look-and-feel/advanced-theme-editor) to overhaul everything with custom CSS, JS, and the [Java FreeMarker template language](https://freemarker.apache.org/).
- write custom pages in your own app that call the [FA API for authentication](http://localhost:3000/docs/apis/authentication), and don't use the hosted login pages  .

```sh from dan
Including a sample theme to handle them.

The ideal login and registration page would be

    accessible
    high conversion
    secure
    html5 compatible
    with conversion tracking
    mobile friendly
    looks sharp
    autocomplete where appropriate: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete
```

```sh from gareth
The ideal login and registration page would be
  - accessible - we could highlight some of the most important parts like screenreaders, tab behaviour, font size, colour contrasts? With a demonstration showing that the example fusionauth login page meets them.
  - high conversion - not sure about this one, maybe something about if a user tries to register with the login form then it should automatically move them to the registration flow? And not harrass them like disabling the password paste field or some other examples of crap that enterprises often do
  - secure - probably just a few obvious things like serving over HTTPS and not logging the password
  - html5 compatible - also probably just like 1-2 basic points like using the right labels?
  - with conversion tracking - maybe add posthog free tier to track new sign ups?
  - mobile friendly - looks like the example themes are, so probably just show an example of how it changes when you resize your window
  - looks sharp - probably kinda subjective, I think can skip this one?
  - autocomplete where appropriate: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete - probably some interesting stuff to add here about how to integrate with password managers too.

Hopefully one of those four themes is already quite close or already meets all of these? I think this doesn’t have to be a full on step-by-step replication guide, but it can be used to both

    - Explain to readers that getting a ‘perfect’ registration/login page is more complicated than just two text fields and a button
    - Show how to add the best practices you care about with Fusionauth by showing example snippets from the theme, and screenshots that demonstrate a specific point.
