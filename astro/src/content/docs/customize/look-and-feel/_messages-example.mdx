Consider the following message bundle and theme usage example with English and German messages defined.

```properties title="English"
greeting=Good day
```

```properties title="German"
greeting=Guten Tag
optional-greeting=Mitmensch
```

```html title="Template"
<p>${theme.message('greeting')} ${theme.optionalMessage('optional-greeting')}</p>
```

If I have selected German as my locale, I will be greeted with `Guten Tag Mitmensch` rendered on the page.

If I have English selected I will instead find the greeting `Good day optional-greeting`.


<Aside type="note">
  Prior to version `1.53.0`, the behavior of `theme.message` and `theme.optionalMessage` differed in that an exception would be thrown if you used `theme.message` and the message key could not be found. While a missing key should be a development time issue, returning the key should provide a better development experience than throwing an exception.

  Beginning in version `1.53.0` there is no difference in behavior between these two methods and you should prefer `theme.message`.
</Aside>

The following example that demonstrates the difference in behavior between `theme.message` and `theme.optionalMessage` only pertains to versions of FusionAuth prior to `1.53.0.`

The behavior differs between `theme.message` and `theme.optionalMessage` only when the key doesn't exist in any of the messages files, including the default one.

When there is no suitable key found and `theme.message` is used, an exception is thrown and the template fails to completely render. When there is no suitable key found and `theme.optionalMessage` is used, the key value is returned: `optional-message` in the example above.

Here's an example of a template that will render for a user with a German locale but fail for a user with an English locale, because `message` fails when there is no key found:

```html title="Template Which Will Fail For Users With an English Locale"
<p>${theme.message('optional-greeting')}</p>
```

Here's a Freemarker function which returns an empty string when there is no value found for an optional message:

```plaintext title="Freemarker Function to Return the Empty String When No Value is Found"
[#function getOptionalMessage key=""]
  [#if "${theme.optionalMessage(key)}" == "${key}"]
    [#return "" /]
  [/#if]
  [#return theme.optionalMessage(key) /]
[/#function]
```

If you add this to your `_helpers.ftl` file, you can call it like this:

```plaintext title="Calling getOptionalMessage"
[@helpers.getOptionalMessage key="optional-greeting" /]
```
