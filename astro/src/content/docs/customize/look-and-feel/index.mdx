## Overview

FusionAuth themes allow you to customize the hosted login pages and other user workflows such as forgot password. In FusionAuth you may create one to many themes and assign a theme per tenant or application so that you can customize the user experience for different users.

See the corresponding [Themes APIs](/docs/apis/themes) if you'd prefer to configure FusionAuth themes via API.

## Customization Levels

FusionAuth theme customization is only useful if you are using the hosted login pages. Using the hosted login pages has a number of advantages. By doing so, FusionAuth handles the complexity of a number of different auth related use cases. These use cases include, but are not limited to, the following:

<ListHostedLoginPagesUseCases />

If you are not using the hosted login pages, you are responsible for creating the user interface for the login and other experiences.

In contrast, if you are using the hosted login pages, you can customize at two different levels.

The first is the tenant. Learn more in the <ScrollRef target="Apply a Theme" /> section.

The second is the application. There are two options for applying a theme at the application level:

* Use a tenant theme and use freemarker to switch on the `client_id` parameter. Review each template and ensure that you serve different content for different applications based on the Id. This is a good option if your needs are simple and you are willing to commit to the maintenance burden.
* Use application themes. This is a paid feature. Learn more about [application specific themes](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/application-specific-themes). This is a better choice if you have more complicated theming needs.

## Create a Theme

FusionAuth provides the ability to create and manage themes in the UI as well as a [Themes API](/docs/apis/themes). Any user of the FusionAuth role of `admin` or `theme_manager` may view, edit, update, and delete Themes.

All of the FusionAuth login templates are written in [FreeMarker](https://freemarker.apache.org). FreeMarker provides a very rich template language that will allow you to customize the pages and helpers to suit your needs. You can also define new macros and functions to assist you further.

Below is an example screenshot of the Add Theme panel with each template described below.

<img src="/img/docs/customize/look-and-feel/create-theme.png" alt="Create a Theme" width="1200" role="shadowed" />

### Form Fields

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Id" optional>
    An optional UUID. When this value is omitted a unique Id will be generated automatically.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Name" required>
    A unique name to identify the theme. This name is for display purposes only and it can be modified later if desired.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>


### Templates

{/* ===== */}
{/*  To add a new theme template, do the following */}
{/*  update site/_date/templates.yaml (further instructions there) */}
{/*  update the JSON files in site/docs/src/json/themes/ with the new theme template key */}
{/*  touch this file to regenerate (if in dev mode) */}
{/*  that's it. the API and the theme form page will be automatically updated. */}

<APIBlock>
  <APIField optional>
    This CSS stylesheet may be used to style the themed pages.

    This CSS will be included in the `head` tag in the Helpers `head` macro. You may also choose to include other remote stylesheets by using the `<style>` tag within the `head` macro.

    ```
    <style>
      ${theme.stylesheet()}
    </style>
    ```
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Messages" optional>
    This section allows you to add additional localized messages to your theme. When creating an additional locale it is not required that all messages are defined for each language. If a message key is not defined for the specified locale, the value from the default bundles will be used.

    If you intend to localize your login templates, you may find our [community contributed and maintained messages in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-localization) helpful.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Helpers" required>
    This template contains all of the main helper macros to define the `head`, `body` and `footer`. To begin theming FusionAuth you'll want to start with this template as it will affect all other templates.

    See the [Helpers](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/helpers) page for additional information.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

## Preview a Theme

If you want to see how your theme works, you can always open a browser with no active FusionAuth session and visit the hosted login pages.

However, at times, you may need to make changes in your theme that you want to view without going through an entire registration process. You can easily do so by previewing the theme via the administrative user interface.

Navigate to <strong>Customizations -> Themes</strong>. Choose your theme, then click the preview link (the green magnifying glass):

<img src="/img/docs/customize/look-and-feel/theme-preview-button.png" alt="Preview your theme" width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

This will open a new tab. Click on any of the pages you've modified in the left hand navigation, for example <InlineField>OAuth register</InlineField>, and you'll see the page as it would be rendered.

## Apply a Theme

You apply a theme by configuring either a Tenant or an Application to use the theme. Each theme may apply to multiple Applications or Tenants; however, each Tenant or Application may have only one theme.

To apply a theme to a Tenant, navigate to <strong>Tenants -> Your Tenant</strong>, then select the <strong>General</strong> tab. Select the appropriate theme and save the tenant. This will apply the theme to every application in that tenant, unless there is a theme specified for an application.

<img src="/img/docs/customize/look-and-feel/apply-theme-tenant.png" alt="Apply a theme to a tenant." width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

<PremiumEditionBlurbApi feature="application themes" />


To apply a theme to an application, navigate to <strong>Applications -> Your Application</strong>, then select the appropriate theme.

<img src="/img/docs/customize/look-and-feel/apply-theme-application.png" alt="Apply a theme to an application." width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

In development, the [FusionAuth theme helper project](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-theme-helper), which automatically uploads a theme to your FusionAuth instance, may be useful.

## Example Code

### Displaying Messages

You can customize messages by locale. You can also have optional keys.

{/*
<MessagesExample />
*/}


### Customizing the Authorize Page

Now that you have a good overview of all the templates, macros and helpers, here is an example of customizing the Authorize page.

Let's assume you want to change the header and footer across all of the pages including the Authorize page. This is accomplished by editing the `helpers.header` and `helpers.footer` macros. For the header, let's assume you want to add a `Sign Up` and `Login` link. For the footer, let's assume you want to add a link to your privacy policy. Here are the macros that include these new links:

```html title="Custom header helper"
[#macro header]
  <header class="my-custom-header">
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li class="login"><a target="_blank" href="https://my-application.com/login">Login</li>
        <li class="sign-up"><a target="_blank" href="https://my-application.com/sign-up">Sign Up</li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>

  [#nested/]
[/#macro]
```

```html title="Custom footer helper"
[#macro footer]
  <footer class="my-custom-footer">
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li class="privacy-policy"><a target="_blank" href="https://my-application.com/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </footer>

  [#nested/]
[/#macro]
```

Once you make these changes, they will take effect on all of the pages listed above.

## Development Tools

When building a theme, the [FusionAuth theme helper project](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-theme-helper) is useful.

You can pull down all your templates, edit them locally, and have them transparently uploaded to your FusionAuth instance.
