## Overview

FusionAuth themes allow you to customize the hosted login pages and other user workflows such as forgot password. In FusionAuth you may create one to many themes and assign a theme per tenant or application so that you can customize the user experience for different users.

<Aside type="note">
  Starting in version 1.51.0 you can use the [Simple Theme Editor](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/simple-theme-editor) to quickly and easily style FusionAuth with no code.

## Customization Levels

FusionAuth theme customization is only useful if you are using the hosted login pages. Using the hosted login pages has a number of advantages. By doing so, FusionAuth handles the complexity of a number of different auth related use cases. These use cases include, but are not limited to, the following:

If you are not using the hosted login pages, you are responsible for creating the user interface for the login and other experiences.

In contrast, if you are using the hosted login pages, you can customize at two different levels.

The first is the tenant. Learn more in the [Apply a Theme](#apply-a-theme) section.

The second is the application. There are two options for applying a theme at the application level:

* Use a tenant theme and use freemarker to switch on the `client_id` parameter. Review each template and ensure that you serve different content for different applications based on the Id. This is a good option if your needs are simple and you are willing to commit to the maintenance burden.
* Use application themes. This is a paid feature. Learn more about [application specific themes](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/application-specific-themes). This is a better choice if you have more complicated theming needs.

## Create a Theme

You have three options for creating a theme: 

* The [Simple Theme Editor](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/simple-theme-editor)
* The [Advanced Theme Editor](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/advanced-theme-editor)
* The [Themes APIs](/docs/apis/themes) or other scripting solution like the [SDKs](/docs/sdks) or [Terraform](/docs/operate/deploy/terraform)

Here's a table with the relative strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches.

| Option                | Good For | Challenges | Documentation | 
| --------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Simple Theme Editor   | Quickly creating a customized look and feel. Upgrading to a new version of FusionAuth, which may have additional templates, is simple.        | Doesn't allow injecting JavaScript or pixel-perfect control. Limited control of layouts of the page. | [docs](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/simple-theme-editor) |
| Advanced Theme Editor | Full control of every aspect of the look and feel, including moving or reordering  fields on the page, adding custom JavaScript, and inserting multiple images | Can be complex to build, though there is some tooling. Complex to upgrade as new versions of FusionAuth come out. Requires knowledge of or willingness to learn Apache Freemarker. | [docs](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/advanced-theme-editor) |
| Theme APIs/SDKs       | Automated application of themes across many tenants. Great if you are using a different templating language to generate many related themes and then uploading them. Good for CI/CD systems. | You still need to initially edit and review the templates somehow; that can be done with a local instance.  |[docs](/docs/apis/themes) |

## Apply a Theme

You apply a theme by configuring either a Tenant or an Application to use the theme. Each theme may apply to multiple Applications or Tenants; however, each Tenant or Application may have only one theme.

To apply a theme to a Tenant, navigate to <Breadcrumb>Tenants -> Your Tenant</Breadcrumb>, then select the <Breadcrumb>General</Breadcrumb> tab. Select the appropriate theme and save the tenant. This will apply the theme to every application in that tenant, unless there is a theme specified for an application.

To apply a theme to an application, navigate to <Breadcrumb>Applications -> Your Application</Breadcrumb>, then select the appropriate theme.
