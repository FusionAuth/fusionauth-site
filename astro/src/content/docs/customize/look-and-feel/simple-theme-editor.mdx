## Overview
<Aside type="version">
  Available since 1.51.0
</Aside>

The Simple Theme Editor allows you to quickly get up and running with a custom FusionAuth theme by selecting a few styles without needing to edit any
Freemarker or HTML.

If you would rather not use the Admin UI you can update the theme via the [Themes API](/docs/apis/themes).

### Difference from advanced themes

FusionAuth allows you to take full control over all of the hosted pages by creating an advanced theme and editing the HTML, CSS, and messages. This is a powerful way to create a fully custom experience, but it can be complex and time-consuming.

Instead of editing the templates directly, the Simple Theme Editor allows you to select from a set of pre-built themes and customize them with a few simple options. This is a great way to get started with customizing FusionAuth without needing to write any code.

## Editor

To get started with the Simple Theme Editor, navigate to <Breadcrumb>Customizations > Themes</Breadcrumb> in the FusionAuth admin UI and either select the `Add Simple Theme` button from the top-right or click the `Duplicate` button on the default FusionAuth simple theme with the name `FusionAuth - Simple`.

Once inside the "Customize Theme" page there are five separate section that you can switch between via the side nav on the left.

## Pre-built themes

Out of the box FusionAuth provides three pre-built themes that you can select from.
- **Classic** - This theme closely resembles the stock FusionAuth theme that you see with the default FusionAuth advanced theme and admin UI.
- **Dark** - A darker theme featuring FusionAuth brand colors.
- **Light** - A lighter theme featuring FusionAuth brand colors.

Selecting one of these will change all the styles currently set for the theme. If you have any un-saved changes in the editor when you select one of these those changes will be discarded.

### Images

Here you can provide links to images that will be included in the theme. FusionAuth does not yet support uploading assets to be hosted, so these must be fully-qualified externally-hosted URLs to link to for the images.

There are two image options here:
- **Logo image URL** - This is the image that will be displayed at the top of the panel on most of the FusionAuth hosted pages.
- **Background image URL** - This is the image that will replace the background color behind the panel on all the FusionAuth hosted pages.

There are also additional controls here:
- **Logo image size** - determines how large the logo image will be.
- **Logo image display** - allows you to toggle the logo image on or off.
- **Background repeat** - sets the [background-repeat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-repeat) property of the background image to either `no-repeat` or `repeat`.
- **Background cover** - sets the [background-size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-size) property of the background image to either `contain` or `cover`.

### Styles

There are three sub-sections in the Styles section that provide controls for most of the styles in the theme.

- **Fonts** - Here you can select from a list of common web fonts for the theme. You may also input a custom font-family value, but be aware that we cannot guarantee a custom font will be available to the browser and the rendered text may be the browser default.
  - **Font family** - this is the font-family used for the majority of the text in the theme.
  - **Mono font family** - this is the font-family used for monospaced text in the theme, such as with MFA recovery codes.
- **Miscellaneous** - Provides controls that don't belong in other sections.
  - **Display footer** - Toggles the "Powered by FusionAuth" footer on or off. **Note:** You must have a valid license to toggle off the footer.
  - **Border radius** - Sets how rounded the corners of panels and form inputs are in the theme.
- **Colors** - Controls for the various colors of the theme. Clicking on the square next to the input field will bring up the browser's color picker and allow you to select any color or use the eye-dropper tool to select a color on the screen. You may put any value into the input field as long as it is a valid hex, hsl, hsla, rgb, or rgba color value. Hovering over a color control will highlight the element on the page that the color applies to. The colors you can set are:
  - **Page background** - The color of the background in the theme.
  - **Panel background** - The color of the main content panel in the theme.
  - **Alert background** - The color of the alert panels in the theme.
  - **Alert font** - The color of the text in the alert panels in the theme.
  - **Font** - The color of the majority of the text in the theme.
  - **Mono font** - The color of monospaced text in the theme, such as with MFA recovery codes.
  - **Error font** - The color of error text in the theme.
  - **Link** - The color of links in the theme.
  - **Input icon background** - The color of the background of the icons for the input fields.
  - **Icon** - The color of the icons in the theme.
  - **Input icon** - The color of the icons for the input fields.
  - **Input text** - The color of the text in the input fields.
  - **Input background** - The color of the background of the input fields.
  - **Primary button** - The color of most buttons in the theme.
  - **Primary button text** - The color of the text on most buttons in the theme.
  - **Delete button** - The color of the delete buttons in the theme.
  - **Delete button text** - The color of the text on the delete buttons in the theme.

### Messages

Allows you to change any of the copy in the theme and provide localization text.

When editing the "Default" locale you will see the full list of the default messages and the comments that explain what they are. However, only properties that you change will be saved to your theme. This ensures only changes you made will be applied and the theme will otherwise always have all of the default text for the theme even after upgrades.

See [Theme Localization](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/localization) for more information.

Note that any changes made to the messaging must be saved to the theme before they show up in the preview.

### Pages Preview

The Pages Preview section allows you to see what the theme will look like on the various FusionAuth hosted pages.

All the hosted pages are ordered into various categories and you can click on any of them to change what is shown in the preview pane.

Additionally, you can click on the `Browser preview` button to open the currently selected page in a new browser tab. The page in the new tab will still have the style updates applied as long as the theme editor is active. This allows you to open several pages and once and see your style changes applied in real time.
