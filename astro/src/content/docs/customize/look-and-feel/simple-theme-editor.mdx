The Simple Theme Editor allows you to quickly get up and running with a custom FusionAuth theme by selecting a few styles, and without needing to edit any Freemarker or HTML. If you would rather not use the Admin UI you can also update a theme via the [Themes API](/docs/apis/themes).

The alternative is to use the [Advanced Theme Editor](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/advanced-theme-editor), which lets you control every aspect of the look and feel of your themes but with significantly more complexity.

### Difference From Advanced Themes

FusionAuth allows you to take full control over all of the hosted pages by creating an advanced theme and editing the HTML, CSS, and messages. This is a powerful way to create a fully custom experience, but it can be complex and time-consuming.

Instead of editing the templates directly, the Simple Theme Editor allows you to select from a set of pre-built themes and customize them with a few simple options. This is a great way to get started with customizing FusionAuth without needing to write any code.

## Creating And Editing Themes

To get started with the Simple Theme Editor, navigate to <Breadcrumb>Customizations > Themes</Breadcrumb> in the FusionAuth admin UI and either select the <InlineUIElement>Add Simple Theme</InlineUIElement> button from the top-right or click the <InlineUIElement>Duplicate</InlineUIElement> button on the default FusionAuth simple theme (the one with the name <InlineUIElement>FusionAuth - Simple</InlineUIElement>). The default simple theme is read-only and can be viewed, but not edited.

To edit an existing simple theme, just click the <Icon name="edit" /> button next to your theme.

<img src="/img/docs/customize/look-and-feel/simple-theme-editor/index.png" alt="Theme index page" />

Once inside the "Customize theme" page there is a section at the top where you can edit the name id Id of the theme, and some panels below where you can change settings and preview your changes.

In the lower part of the editor you'll find three main panels. The leftmost panel contains a set of buttons that control the editing tools that you'll see in the rightmost panel. They are:

* [Pre-built themes](#pre-built-themes)
* [Images](#images)
* [Styles](#styles)
* [Messages](#messages)
* [Pages preview](#pages-preview)

In the center of the editor, you'll see a preview panel, where you can see what your edits will look like on the different theme templates.

### Name And Id

In the top section, you can choose a name and Id for your theme. A unique name is required, but an Id will be assigned automatically if you don't provide one.

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Id" optional>
    An optional UUID. When this value is omitted a unique Id will be generated automatically.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Name" required>
    A unique name to identify the theme. This name is for display purposes only and it can be modified later if desired.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

### Pre-Built Themes

Out of the box, FusionAuth provides three pre-built themes that you can select from. These provide a starting point, from which you can make changes. They are:
- **Classic** - This theme closely resembles the stock FusionAuth theme that you see with the default FusionAuth advanced theme
- **Dark** - A darker theme featuring FusionAuth brand colors
- **Light** - A lighter theme featuring FusionAuth brand colors

Selecting one of these will change all the styles currently set for the theme. If you have any un-saved changes in the editor when you select one of these, those changes will be discarded. In this case you'll be asked to confirm that you want to lose your changes and load a new pre-built theme.

### Images

In the `Images` section you can provide links to logo and page background images that will be used in the theme. You'll also find settings that control image sizing and placement. FusionAuth does not yet support uploading assets to be hosted, so these must be fully-qualified URLs that link to externally hosted images.

<img src="/img/docs/customize/look-and-feel/simple-theme-editor/images.png" alt="Theme image controls" />

<APIBlock>
  ##### Theme logo
  This is the image that will be displayed at the top of the panel on most of the FusionAuth hosted pages.

  <APIField name="Logo image URL" optional>
    The fully-qualified URL to the image that will be used as the logo.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Logo image size">
    This slider determines how large the logo image will be. The slider defaults to `rem` units, but you can use `em` or `px` as well if you know what size that the image should be. Required if the <InlineUIElement>Logo image URL</InlineUIElement> is set.
  </APIField>

  ##### Background image
  This image will be used as the page background on all hosted pages. This setting supersedes a page background color.

  <APIField name="Background image URL">
    The fully-qualified URL to the image that will be used as the page background.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Background size">
    This dropdown controls the the [background-repeat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-repeat) and [background-size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-size) properties of the background image.There are three options:

    - **Contain** - sets the [background-size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-size) property of the background image to `contain` and the [background-repeat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-repeat) property to `no-repeat`. This will leave the image in its original aspect ratio and not repeat it, and size it to the width of the screen. Below the image will be the theme background color.
    - **Cover** - sets the [background-size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-size) property of the background image to `cover`. This will size the image to cover the entire background, cropping it if necessary to maintain the aspect ratio.
    - **Repeat** - sets the [background-repeat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-repeat) property of the background image to `repeat`. This will repeat the image in both the x and y directions and retain its original size.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

### Styles

There are three sub-sections in the Styles section that provide controls for most of the styles in the theme.

 <img src="/img/docs/customize/look-and-feel/simple-theme-editor/styles.png" alt="Theme style controls" />

<APIBlock>

  ##### Fonts
  Here you can select from a list of common web fonts for the theme. You may also input a custom font-family value, but be aware that we cannot guarantee a custom font will be available to the browser and the rendered text may be the browser default.

  <APIField name="Font family" required>
    This is the font-family used for the majority of the text in the theme.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Custom font family">
    This is the optional input for a custom font-family value.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Mono font family" required>

  ##### Miscellaneous
  Provides controls that don't belong in other sections.

  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Border radius" required>
    Sets how rounded the corners of panels and form inputs are in the theme. The slider defaults to `rem` units, but you can use `em` or `px` as well if you know what value of the border radius should be.
  </APIField>

  ##### Colors
  Controls for the various colors of the theme. Clicking on the square next to the input field will bring up the browser's color picker and allow you to select any color or use the eye-dropper tool to select a color on the screen. You may put any value into the input field as long as it is a valid hex, hsl, hsla, rgb, or rgba color value. Hovering over a color control will highlight the element on the page that the color applies to. The colors you can set are:

</APIBlock>

### Messages

Allows you to change any of the copy in the theme, and also provide localized versions of messages.

<img src="/img/docs/customize/look-and-feel/simple-theme-editor/messages.png" alt="Theme messages editor" />

<APIField name="Messages" optional>
  When editing the "Default" locale you will see the full list of the default messages and the comments that explain what they are. However, only properties that you change will be saved to your theme. This ensures only changes you made will be applied and the theme will otherwise always have all of the default text for the theme even after upgrades.

  See [Theme Localization](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/localization) for more information.

  Any changes made to the messaging will be shown in the preview, but the whole theme must be saved in order to persist those changes.

  When creating an additional locale it is not required that all messages are defined for each language.

  If you intend to localize your login templates, you may find our [community contributed and maintained messages in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-localization) helpful.
</APIField>

### Pages Preview

The Pages Preview section allows you to see what the theme will look like on the various FusionAuth hosted pages.

All the hosted pages are ordered into various categories, and you can click on any of them to change what is shown in the preview pane.

Additionally, you can click on the `Browser preview` button to open the currently selected page in a new browser tab. The page in the new tab will still have the style updates applied as long as the theme editor is active. This allows you to open several pages and once and see your style changes applied in real time.

## Troubleshooting

<ThemeTroubleshooting />

## Upgrading

With simple themes, upgrading is simple, as the styles you've configured are applied to any new templates that are added.

New messages will automatically be applied to your theme after an upgrade. The only thing stored in your theme are customizations that override the default text.
