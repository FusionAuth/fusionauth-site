### Theme Errors Preventing Login

If you have modified a custom theme and it is causing errors preventing you from logging in to FusionAuth or the admin UI, you can override the use of the UI templates. This will render a form allowing you to log in. To do this:

* Open your browser and access your FusionAuth admin UI. 
* This will redirect you to the broken `/oauth2/authorize` page. 
* Click in your browser's address bar and scroll to the end. 
* Add the String `&bypassTheme=true` to the end of the URL and hit the Enter key. 

This should render the default login page that ships with FusionAuth and allow you to log in and fix errors.

### Default Theme Used Incorrectly

Anytime a request is made to a themed page and FusionAuth is unable to identify the tenant, the default tenant will be used. This includes, but is not limited to:

* The root page `/` when a `client_id` or `tenantId` is not provided.
* Any themed pages such as `/password/forgot` when a `client_id` is not provided.
* Edge case error conditions where FusionAuth doesn't have context to determine the application or tenant.

If you see the default theme unexpectedly, ensure you are passing required parameters, such as the `tenantId` or `client_id`, to the page so that it can determine the applicable application or tenant. These parameters allow FusionAuth to determine the correct theme to display.

### Theme Will Not Retain Change(s)

If you have upgraded your version of FusionAuth and are using an Advanced Theming, you will need to make changes post upgrade for each theme you have built.

On theme "save" in the UI, these changes will be marked with an orange icon next to the page needing attention.

Additionally, in the messages bundle a validation notice will indicate the message keys to be added to support the newer version.
