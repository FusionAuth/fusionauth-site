## Overview

This section is designed to review how to utilize email, email templates, and messenger templates in FusionAuth. See [Email APIs](/docs/apis/emails) for additional information on integrating directly with the email APIs and [Messenger Templates](/docs/apis/messengers/) for more information on modifying messenger templates directly.

## Email

Email and Email Templates are a core feature of FusionAuth. [Email Templates](/docs/customize/email-and-messages/templates-replacement-variables) allows you to communicate with your Users via email. You can manage these templates using the API, SDKs or manually. FusionAuth
provides [example email templates for workflows](/docs/customize/email-and-messages/templates-replacement-variables), but you should plan to revise them to reflect your sites branding. 

In order to use email templates and email based workflows, you will need to [configure an SMTP server](/docs/customize/email-and-messages/configure-email). 

Here's a brief video covering some aspects of email templates:

## Message Templates

Message templates are used by Messengers. Currently there is only one messenger type: SMS. Just as with emails, these can be customized and localized, but unlike email templates, there are not HTML and text versions of a messenger template.

Here are the topics in this section:
