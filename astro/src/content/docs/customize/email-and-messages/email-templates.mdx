## Overview

FusionAuth will use email templates to send a Forgot Password request, and other built in workflows. You may also create your own email templates and send them to Users via the [Send Email](/docs/apis/emails#send-an-email) API.

## Managing Templates

FusionAuth ships with several templates to support Forgot Password, Setup Password, Verify Email and other workflows. You will want to modify these templates prior to using them in production.

Apart from modifying them to be more cosmetically pleasing or to match your brand, you will need to ensure the URL used in the template is correct. You will need to ensure the URL is publicly accessible.

When you first log into FusionAuth and navigate to <strong>Customizations -> Email Templates</strong> you will see the following templates.

For example, below is the email body of the Email Verification template as it is shipped with FusionAuth.

At a minimum, you will need to update this URL to a publicly accessible URL that can reach FusionAuth.

If you will be handling Email Verification yourself, you will need to update this URL to be that of your own. You will notice the one replacement variable in this template named `${verificationId}`. See the Replacement Variables section below for additional detail, but these variables will be replaced when the template is rendered.

### Base Information

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Id" optional>
    The unique Id of the email template. The template Id may not be changed and will be used to interact with the template when using the Email APIs.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Name" required>
    The name of the template. This value is for display purposes only and can be changed at any time.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Default Subject" required>
    The default subject of the email. The default value will be used unless a localized version is found to be a better match based upon the User's preferred locales.

    This field supports replacement variables.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="From Email" optional>
    The from email address used to send this template. As of version 1.16.0, this field is optional.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Default from Name" optional>
    The default from name of the email. The default value will be used unless a localized version is found to be a better match based upon the User's preferred locales.

    This field supports replacement variables.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

## Localization

The email template body (both HTML and text values), subject, and from name fields can be localized.

You can associate these values with a locale. If a user has a preferred language, the localized template will be used when this email is sent.
