## Templates & Replacement Variables

The email template body (both HTML and text values), subject, and from name fields support replacement variables. This means placeholders can be inserted and the value will be calculated at the time the email template is rendered and sent to a user.

Most templates will contain the User object as returned on the Retrieve User API. This means you can utilize any value found on the User object such as email, first name, last name, etc.

Below you will find each stock template that FusionAuth ships for reference. The available replacement values will be outlined below for each template.

<Aside type="caution">
If you create a template with content and template variables for one type of email template (Forgot Password), but assign it to another type of email template (Passwordless Login, for example), the email will not be sent as expected.

Instead, the attempt will fail and there will be an error added to the Event Log.
</Aside>


## Using Replacement Variables

Below are some basic examples of using replacement values in your email templates.

Consider the following User represented by this condensed JSON object.
```json
{
  "email": "monica@piedpiper.com",
  "firstName": "Monica",
  "id": "1c592f8a-59c6-4a09-82f8-f4257e3ea4c8",
  "lastName": "Hall"
}
```

The following are example usages with a rendered output based upon the above mentioned example User. The replacement variables are rendered
using [Apache FreeMarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/index.html) which is an HTML template language.

A default value should be provided for variables that may be undefined at runtime such as `firstName`. See `firstName` in the example below
is followed by a bang `!` and then the string `Unknown User`. This indicates that if `firstName` is undefined when the template is rendered the value
of `Unknown User` should be used as a default value.

*Template Source*
```html
Hi ${user.firstName!'Unknown User'}, welcome to Pied Piper.

Please verify your email address ${user.email} by following the provided link.

https://piedpiper.fusionauth.io/email/verify/${verificationId}
- Admin
```

*Rendered Output*
```html
Hi Monica, welcome to Pied Piper.

Please verify your email address monica@piedpiper.com by following the provided link.

https://piedpiper.fusionauth.io/email/verify/YkQY5Gsyo4RlfmDciBGRmvfj3RmatUqrbjoIZ19fmw4
- Admin
```

## Custom Replacement Variables

In addition to the variables mentioned in the previous section, when defining your own email templates to be used by the [Send Email](/docs/apis/emails#send-an-email) API
custom data may be provided on the API request to be used in the email template.

On Send Email API request the contents of the `requestData` field will be made available to you when the template is rendered.

For example, consider the following request to the Send API to send email template Id `1bc118ae-d5fa-4cdf-a90e-e8ef55c3e11e` to the User by Id `ce485a91-906f-4615-af75-81d37dc71e90`.

<API method="POST" uri="/api/email/send/1bc118ae-d5fa-4cdf-a90e-e8ef55c3e11e"/>

```json title="Example Request JSON"
{
  "requestData": {
    "paymentAmount": "$9.99",
    "product": "party hat",
    "quantity": "12"
  },
  "userIds": [
    "ce485a91-906f-4615-af75-81d37dc71e90"
  ]
}
```

*Template Source*
```html
Hello ${user.firstName!''},

Thank you for your purchase! We value your business, please come again!

Product: ${requestData.product!'unknown'}
Quantity: ${requestData.quantity!'unknown'}

- Pied Piper Customer Success
```

*Rendered Output*
```html
Hello Kelly,

Thank you for your purchase! We value your business, please come again!

Product: party hat
Quantity: 12
