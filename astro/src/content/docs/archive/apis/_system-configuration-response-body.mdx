    A [FreeMarker](https://freemarker.apache.org) template that is rendered when the user requests the /email/send page. This page is used after a user has asked for the verification email to be resent. This can happen if the URL in the email expired and the user clicked it. In this case, the user can provide their email address again and FusionAuth will resend the email. After the user submits their email and FusionAuth re-sends a verification email to them, the browser is redirected to this page.

For example, if you are federating login to an external IdP and that IdP does not properly echo the `state` parameter, FusionAuth's OAuth workflow will break and this page will be displayed.
