## Overview

<Aside type="caution">
This documentation is for version 1.25 and earlier. Breaking changes were introduced to this API in 1.26.

Do not use this API unless you are on a version of FusionAuth earlier than 1.26. You can view the [current two factor documentation if you are on version 1.26 or higher](/docs/apis/two-factor).
</Aside>

## Enable Two Factor

This API is used to enable Two Factor authentication for a single User. To use this API the User must provide a valid
Two Factor verification code.

To enable using `TextMessage` delivery, you may use the [Two Factor Send](/docs/apis/two-factor#send-a-multi-factor-code-when-enabling-mfa) API to deliver a
code to the User, the User will then provide this code as input.

### Request

<API method="POST" uri="/api/user/two-factor/{userId}" authentication={["api-key"]} title="Enable Two Factor Authentication"/>

#### Request Parameters

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="userId" type="UUID" required>
    The Id of the User to enable Two Factor authentication.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

<XFusionauthTenantIdHeaderScopedOperation />

<br/>
<API method="POST" uri="/api/user/two-factor" authentication={["jwt"]} title="Enable Two Factor Authentication"/>

<XFusionauthTenantIdHeaderScopedOperation />

#### Request Body

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="code" type="String" required>
    A valid Two Factor verification code. This value should be provided by the User to verify they are able to produce codes using
    an application or receive them using their mobile phone.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="delivery" type="String" required>
    The User's preferred delivery for verification codes during a two factor login request.

    The possible values are:

    * <InlineFieldValue>None</InlineFieldValue>
    * `TextMessage`

    When using `TextMessage` the User will also need a valid `mobilePhone`. The User's mobile phone is not validated during this request. Because the `code` is provided on this request it is assumed the User has been able to receive a `code` on their mobile phone when setting the delivery to `TextMessage`.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="secret" type="String" optional>
    A base64 encoded secret.

    You may optionally use the <InlineField>secret</InlineField> value returned by the [Two Factor Secret](/docs/apis/two-factor#generate-a-secret) API instead of generating this value yourself. This value is a secure random byte array that is Base-64 encoded.

    If you omit this field, then <InlineField>secretBase32Encoded</InlineField> is required.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="secretBase32Encoded" type="String" optional>
    A base32 encoded secret.

    You may optionally use the <InlineField>secretBase32Encoded</InlineField> value returned by the [Two Factor Secret](/docs/apis/two-factor#generate-a-secret) API instead of generating this value yourself. This value is a secure random byte array that is Base-32 encoded.

    If you omit this field, then <InlineField>secret</InlineField> is required.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

## Send a Two Factor Code

This API is used to send a Two Factor verification code to a User. This may be useful during Two Factor authentication if the initial
code is no longer valid. It may be also used to send a code to a User to assist in enabling or disabling Two Factor authentication.

To send a code to a User that already has Two Factor enabled, it is not required they have `TextMessage` set as their preferred delivery.
As long as the User has a mobile phone defined you may send the User a code.

This API requires that the [Twilio](/docs/customize/email-and-messages/deprecated/twilio) integration is enabled and configured properly.

### Request

<API method="POST" uri="/api/two-factor/send" authentication={["api-key"]} title="Send a Two Factor code to an existing User by Id"/>

This request is intended to be used to send a Two Factor code to a User that already has enabled Two Factor authentication to assist in disabling Two Factor authentication. The User must already have Two Factor enabled and have a valid mobile phone for this to succeed.

<XFusionauthTenantIdHeaderScopedOperation />

#### Request Body

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="userId" type="UUID" required>
    The User Id of the User to send a Two Factor verification code. This User is expected to already have Two Factor enabled.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

<JSON title="Example Request JSON" src="two-factor/send/request_userId-pre-1-26.json" />

<API method="POST" uri="/api/two-factor/send" authentication={["api-key"]} title="Send a Two Factor code to a mobile phone"/>

This request is intended to be used to send a Two Factor code to a User to assist in enabling Two Factor authentication.

#### Request Body

    A mobile phone to send the Two Factor verification code.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="secret" type="String" required>
    The Two Factor secret used to generate a Two Factor verification code to send to the provided mobile phone.

    You may optionally use value provided in the <InlineField>secret</InlineField> field returned by the [Two Factor Secret](/docs/apis/two-factor#generate-a-secret) API instead of generating this value yourself.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

<JSON title="Example Request JSON" src="two-factor/send/request-pre-1-26.json" />

If this secret will be used with a QR code to allow the User to scan the value it will need utilize the Base32 encoded value returned in
the response.
