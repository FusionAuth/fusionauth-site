Safely manage your users' third party API tokens in one place. Add new [social](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/identity-providers/#social-identity-providers) or [enterprise](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/identity-providers/#enterprise-identity-providers) providers as needed. Secure the refresh tokens and other credentials for social providers like Google, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, Microsoft, and more.

FusionAuth handles the integrations and your engineering team uses one API to retrieve tokens across all social providers.
