Transparently allow users to log in once and switch between your different applications. As you add more applications, theyâ€™ll be able to move between them, similar to the GSuite of products, where you can transparently access Google Calendar, Google Drive, and Gmail even though they are on different domains.

This works with both mobile and web applications. You can limit users to a subset of applications and assign different roles per application.
