Use FusionAuth as a rock solid user data store, but take control of the login workflows, the user experience, and other aspects of the authentication experience. You have complete control over the location of the data and how your users log in. This can be helpful if you have stringent UX or unique workflow requirements.

Use the Login API and other APIs to create your own user interfaces. Build your own workflows that meet your precise needs. FusionAuth can be the foundation as a simple, secure datastore with unlimited profile data, search capabilities, and security built in.
