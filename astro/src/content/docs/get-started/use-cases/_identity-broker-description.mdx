If you deploy software to private clouds or data centers, you can add FusionAuth to your application. It can operate as a lightweight identity broker, which lets you support your customerâ€™s identity provider and offer single sign-on to your application's users. Your software integrates into your customer's authentication and authorization solution and more seamlessly into their environment.

Leverage FusionAuth's documentation on how to configure connections to Microsoft Entra ID, Okta and more. Instead of figuring out each integration, your engineering team uses the FusionAuth APIs and SDKs to get user and role data.
