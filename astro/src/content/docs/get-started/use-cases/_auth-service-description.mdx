Easily offload authentication and add features with configuration rather than coding. The user who logs in could be a consumer (b2c) or a business user (b2b). Features include: 

* adding a "Log in with Google" or "Log in with SAML" button
* multi-factor authentication (MFA) via SMS, time based one time passwords (TOTP) or email
* login with a one-time password (OTP) or magic links
* passkeys
* self-service registration and profile management
* verification of user account ownership using email messages
