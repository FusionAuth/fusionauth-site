import APIKeyCrossTenantNote from 'src/content/docs/apis/_api-key-cross-tenant-note.mdx';

When you assign an API key to a tenant, any requests made with this key will only be able to operate on users, applications, groups, and other entities in the selected tenant.

<APIKeyCrossTenantNote />

Build in authorization logic if you allow customers to modify other entities to ensure that one tenant can't inadvertently or maliciously modify another tenant's configuration. It is recommended that you have a single piece of any non-tenant scoped configuration for each tenant. For instance, don't share email templates or themes.
