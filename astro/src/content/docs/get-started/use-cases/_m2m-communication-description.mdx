Manage authentication and permissions for software programs using the client credentials grant and access tokens. More secure than static API keys, with fine grained permissions and service identity built in. 

Self-host FusionAuth and embed it into your Kubernetes cluster, on-prem data center or other environment. 

FusionAuth can scale to hundreds of millions of entities (APIs, devices) and you can manage the entire solution via language specific SDKs.
