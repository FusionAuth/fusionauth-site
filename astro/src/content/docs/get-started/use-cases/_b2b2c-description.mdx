Offer a SaaS software package, where your customers have consumers as customers or users. The end users of the software control their own identity and typically self-register to gain access to your system.

With this case, users typically access your SaaS software using hostnames tied to customers: `customerA.example.com` and `customerB.example.com`, or `yoursaas.customerA.com` or `yoursaas.customerB.com`.

You can have each customer's users isolated, so that customer A's users are distinct from customer B's users. The users belonging to customer A will be logically isolated and separate from the users of customer B. You can customize the login screens, password rules, allowed login methods (including social login), and security settings for each of your customers. This is common practice when private labeling software.

Or you can allow end users to switch between customers, like a user can do with GitHub organizations. Each user can have different permissions for each customer. This is useful if there are cross cutting users like contractors, who might work with more than one customer account.
