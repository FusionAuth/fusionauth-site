Offer a SaaS software package, where your customers have business employees as customers or users.

With this case, users typically access your SaaS solution using hostnames tied to customers: `customerA.yoursaas.com` and `customerB.yoursaas.com`, or `yoursaas.customerA.com` or `yoursaas.customerB.com`. They may also use an Org Id input form, like the AWS console, which then directs the user to the correct location.

Businesses typically have their own employee directory using tools like Okta, Azure AD, and Google Workspace. They want to control access to your application automatically using tools like SCIM or SAML/OIDC just-in-time provisioning.

You can have each customer's users isolated, so that customer A's users are distinct from customer B's users. The users belonging to customer A will be logically isolated and separate from the users of customer B. You can customize the login screens and identity provider settings of each of your customers. You can translate between the roles at the customer and within your application using our reconcile lambdas. This is common if you are private labeling your software.
