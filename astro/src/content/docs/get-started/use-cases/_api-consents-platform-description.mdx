If you have APIs that others are building on top of, use FusionAuth to manage user data, and want to allow your users to delegate access to their data accessible via your APIs, FusionAuth can handle the OAuth grant, including custom scopes and access token customization. The application or AI agent can then use the token to access APIs on your user's behalf.

FusionAuth can be part of your API platform strategy, handling user consent and access token generation.
