## Overview

<B2B2EDescription />

<Aside type="note">
There are multiple users in a business to business to employee (b2b2e) system and the different types can be confusing.

In this document, the term `customer` refers to people who are paying you to use the application you have built. The term `user` refers to their users, typically employees or contractors. Users are the end users of your software application.
</Aside>

## Problem 

You have an application that you sell to customers; they then have their own users. You want these users to safely log in to your application with a customized experience unique to each customer. Users identities are controlled by the associated customer, but there may be some personal identifiable information of users stored in your authentication system.

## Solution

With the b2b2e use case, you allow the users of your customers to securely authenticate. You can also allow your customers to manage users.

This use case is appropriate when the identity of the end user is *controlled* by the customer. If the identity of the end user is controlled by the end user, the [b2b2c use case](/docs/get-started/use-cases/b2b2c) is a better option.

## Prerequisites

You have configured your application or applications to [delegate authentication to FusionAuth](/docs/get-started/use-cases/auth-service) via the Authorization Code grant and the hosted login pages.

## Example Scenario

Suppose your company, ClownTime, sells a time tracking system for circuses. Your software package lets circus clowns and performers track their hours.

Your customers are the circuses, and their users are *their* employees or contractors. Each circus has its own remote user directory, and wants to control access to ClownTime through those directories. Acces is not simply allows or disallowed; some employees are managers and should have greater access to reports in ClownTime.

You are super excited because you've landed both Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus and Cirque du Soleil as customers; they have large staffs to manage. Here's a diagram of the relationship between ClownTime, its customers and the end users.

<CircusesRelationships alt="Circus relationships diagram."/>

The people who fill out time sheets can be either people or companies. For example, `ContractMarketingCorp` is a marketing corporation that promotes Cirque du Soleil on a monthly basis. The set of employees for each circus can also overlap. Jamie Morgan is an example of a customer of both circuses.

* your customer's user and their client application (mobile app or browser)
* your application
* FusionAuth

## Implementation Steps

There are a few implementation steps to ensure your customers' employees will be able to enter their timesheets correctly. This is a tenant based implementation, where users are stored in different FusionAuth tenants.

The steps include:

* Setting up your system to handle adding new customers
* Letting customers' users sign in using their employee directory

Here's a high level sequence diagram of the process of adding new customers. Each customer is represented as a tenant. With b2b2e, you usually want to capture information needed to configure an identity provider, such as SAML public keys or OIDC client Ids and secrets. This will be captured in your application and then provided to FusionAuth via API or SDK to allow users to log in via that identity provider.

Here's a high level sequence diagram of a user logging in to a customer's time tracking systems. The application is responsible for mapping the user to the correct customer.

Let's look at these steps in detail.

### Adding New Customers

To add new customers, you need to make changes to both the ClownTime ticketing application and FusionAuth configuration.

#### Preparing The ClownTime Application

Make sure your circus SaaS application can handle multiple tenants. At a minimum, you need to ensure your application has some way to distinguish each customer's access points. There are a couple of ways to do this, but the most typical is to offer a different hostname for each customer. If the ticketing application is hosted at `example.com`, you might have the following hostnames:

* `ringling.example.com` for Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus ticketing
* `cirquedesoleil.example.com` for Cirque du Soleil ticketing

Ensure your web application can respond to multiple hostnames. If you don't want to have customer specific hostnames, there are [other options](/docs/extend/examples/multi-tenant#data-plane-application-tenant-determination).

There are other aspects of a multi-tenant application, such as logically isolating customer data. Such multi-tenant application architecture guidance is beyond the scope of this document.

#### Configuring FusionAuth

For each new customer, you'll need to update configuration in the ClownPass FusionAuth instance. You'll need to:

* create a new Tenant
* create a new Application in that Tenant
* configuring the correct redirect URL for the Application
* create a new Tenant locked API key
* configure the Application to use desired Identity Provider, such as a Google Workspace or Entra ID
* create Email Templates and Themes appropriate for the customer's brand

TODO idp_hint where to show that?
TODO make sure the user is registered when they use an identity provider

You can script these steps using one of the [SDKs](/docs/sdks).

Record information such as the API key, the identity provider Id, the client Id and client secret from the Application configuration in your application's database. Later, your application will look up this information based on the request hostname.

When using FusionAuth Cloud, you can [configure FusionAuth to respond to different hostnames](/docs/get-started/run-in-the-cloud/cloud#custom-domains). You can also do the same with self-hosted FusionAuth. In addition to the hostnames above, you could also have:

* `auth.ringling.example.com` for Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus login host
* `auth.cirquedesoleil.example.com` for Cirque du Soleil login host

If you don't use hostname customization, users may see a domain name they don't expect when logging in.

Once the customer is set up, you have a variety of methods to get users into FusionAuth. They can be:

* migrated in from an existing store
* provisioned 'just-in-time' by logging in using the identity provider
* created directly using the API or SDKs
* provisioned using SCIM if the source user data stores support SCIM

Pick one or more methods that work for your use case; FusionAuth supports them all.

### User Authentication

When a user comes to the Ringling site hosted by ClownTime, they must be redirected to a FusionAuth authorization URL with the appropriate client Id and redirect URL. This will be used to start the Authorization Code grant which will authenticate this user. Here's an [explanation of how to create the URL and what each component means](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/endpoints#authorization-code-grant-request).

Additionally, the identity provider Id can be used and an `idp_hint` parameter can be added to the the authorization URL. Providing the `idp_hint` will skip the FusionAuth login page entirely and direct the employee to the identity store.

If you don't use the `idp_hint`, the user will see a Ringling themed page because of the previous customization and the provided client Id. Other interactions with FusionAuth, such as a "forgot password" email, should be Ringling themed as well.

After the user authenticates and is redirected to the ClownTime application, the client Id and client secret can be looked up in the application database based on the hostname in the redirect URL. The circus ticketing web application handles many client Ids and secrets, one for each customer. The client Id and client secret are provided to FusionAuth to complete the Authorization Code grant. Here's an [explanation of that request](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/endpoints#complete-the-authorization-code-grant-request).

The [tokens](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/tokens) contain information about the user and their roles. The ClownTime application can use them to determine correct levels of access or data to retrieve.

### User Management

TODO. what levels of user management make sense when the identity is controlled remotely?

Customer admins and other privileged users will add, read, update and delete user data using the ClownPass application. While there is a lot of user management functionality exposed as an API you could add to your application, common functionality includes:

* resetting a user's password
* locking a user
* changing user profile data

The application uses the tenant locked API key and an SDK to allow customer admins to perform user management.

Users can manage their own profile and credentials using the [self-service account management](/docs/lifecycle/manage-users/account-management/) provided by FusionAuth.

### Implementation Notes

Each customer's users are entirely separate with this tenant based implementation. A person can sign up with the email address `jamie.morgan@example.com` for both Ringling Brothers and Cirque De Soleil. The person who owns the `jamie.morgan@example.com` email address may not even know the ticketing application for these circuses are both provided by ClownPass.

Each account is entirely separate with no relation to each other. The accounts can have different:

* profile attributes
* credentials
* roles in applications

### Alternative Implementation

The tenant based solution outlined above has distinct user spaces. If you want a shared user space, where the `jamie.morgan@example.com` user has the same profile data and credentials no matter which circus they are buying tickets for, you need to use a different approach. Instead of separate tenants, have all users in one tenant and model each circus ticketing application as a separate FusionAuth Application configuration. Make sure to build and enforce your own authorization scheme to ensure customer admins from Ringling Brothers couldn't access Cirque De Soleils' users, since you can't use tenant locked API keys.

TODO* create a [Login Validation Lambda](/docs/extend/code/lambdas/login-validation) to ensure that only the correct Identity Provider is used

Here's a table which shows tradeoffs between these different approaches.

<UserSegmentTable />

You might want to use one of the alternative options if users must be able to seamlessly purchase tickets from different circuses with a single account. This is similar to the approach of GitHub or Slack.

## Expected Outcome

Your web or mobile application has isolated groups of users, one set for each customer. Each user has their own profile data and manages their identity, either in your application or via other login methods such as social sign-on.

Admins can use whatever user management related functionality you choose to expose in your application, using tenant locked API keys to limit access.

## Edge Cases

The word `tenant` can be overloaded. When you are planning for this use case, make sure you distinguish between tenants in your application and FusionAuth tenants. They don't have to map one to one.

<CrossTenantUserAccess />

## Other Example Scenarios

Any application which has customers who then have their own users or customers is a good fit for this use case.

A very common scenario is a private labelled product sold to SMBs or consumers. Examples include:

* Website builders resold by creative agencies
* Appointment schedulers for hair salons, personal trainers and other service providers
* Private labelled job boards
* Accounting software sold to CPAs and used by the customers they offer tax services to

In each of these cases there is a clear differentiation between the customer organization buying the solution and their end customer. This use case is appropriate when the user identity is *not* controlled by the customer, but rather by the user themselves.
