title: Auth As A Service
description: What is Auth As A Service?
section: get started
subcategory: use cases
---

## Problem 

Authentication is core to your application's usage, but is not a differentiated feature. You get requests from other parts of the organization that distract from building business features:

- security requests enforcement of MFA to protect accounts
- compliance requests customer PII be isolated to certain geographic regions
- product management wants to enable new methods of logging in to increase conversion

## Solution

Auth as a service helps you build a better application by delegating core, undifferentiated functionality to a specialized software solution like FusionAuth. After integration, you get the benefits of feature development without spending engineering time and specialized focus on protecting your data.

## Actors/Components

You have the following actors in this system before the migration:

* your user and their client (mobile app or browser)
* your application, which includes your user data store, which may be a table or multiple tables inside your application's datastore

After you introduce auth as a service, you have the following components:

* your user and their client (mobile app or browser)
* your application
* FusionAuth

## Implementation Steps

* integrate FusionAuth into your application
* migrate user data
