## Todo

- create an overview page
- create stytch account, add users, export them and all details
- https://stytch.com/docs/guides/migrations/migrating-user-data-statically
- review other services migration pages this references

## Introduction

- Setup Dual Write: Modify the application to write to both the old system and Stytch.
- Perform Backfill: Export data from the old system and import it into Stytch.
- Final Sync: After backfill, ensure all data is up-to-date on both sides. Password hashes are final step.
- Cutover: Once confident in the data integrity and operation of Stytch, you can fully cutover to using it as the sole authentication system.

Alternatively, redirect new users to FusionAuth and you don't need to do dual write.
Rolling migration:
- keep all usernames in local database
- have a flag to indicate if they are new
- more difficult if your code has provider-specific code to interact with Stytch or FusionAuth. In this case, you need to extract an interface (contract) for what the code is doing, and write a second class that fulfils the contract. Your app can then call the same functions in either class, choosing whether to use new or old based on the user flag.
