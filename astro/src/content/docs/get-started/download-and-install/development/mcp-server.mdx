## Overview

FusionAuth has a model context protocol (MCP) server which allows you to manipulate a FusionAuth instance using any MCP compatible client.

It does so by exposing each FusionAuth API operation as an MCP tool.

<Aside type="caution">
This MCP server is a preview release and may break, change or be discontinued in the future.
</Aside>

You can use this MCP server to interact with FusionAuth using natural language to:

* perform quick setup of FusionAuth features: "set up a custom registration form for the Pied Piper application. require email address and password, but allow first name and favorite color to be optional. put them all on one page"
* to explore an existing instance's configuration: "is PKCE enforced for all my applications"
* to export configuration as a kickstart or Terraform file: "please export the configuration for the Pied Piper application to a kickstart file"

The MCP server is installed using the stdio transport and so pairs well with FusionAuth's when run locally.

<Aside type="caution">
Using this MCP server provides the MCP client with a FusionAuth API key. Use this MCP server for development and test instances only.

FusionAuth is not responsible for potentially leaking sensitive information.
