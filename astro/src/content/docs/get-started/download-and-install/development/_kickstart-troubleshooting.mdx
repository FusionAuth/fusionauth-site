### Kickstart is not running

If your Kickstart file doesn't run on your instance, here are some troubleshooting steps to take.

* Ensure you have provided a Kickstart JSON file via the [appropriate configuration parameter](/docs/reference/configuration). 
* Make sure the file is valid JSON, using a linter. 
* If the file references any other files (such as email templates), ensure they exist as well.
* Kickstart will not run if it sees any users, API keys, or applications in the FusionAuth database. This is to prevent data loss. If you can log in to the FusionAuth administrative user interface, Kickstart will not run.

Additionally, Kickstart takes time to run, depending on how many API calls you make and what kind of API calls they are. If you are starting up an instance with Kickstart and you visit the FusionAuth administrative user interface in your browser, you may see the Setup Wizard briefly while Kickstart is running. After Kickstart finishes, you should not see the Setup Wizard. This may require a browser refresh.

### Different entity types or templates exist in kickstarted instances of FusionAuth than clean installs

<Aside type="note">
  FusionAuth provides default lambda functions to support IDPs and SCIM, and these lambdas are present in any FusionAuth instance, whether or not it was kickstarted.
</Aside>

FusionAuth provides the following entity types, email templates, and message templates by default. A kickstarted FusionAuth instance will not contain these, as the intent is to have a kickstarted instance to be as much of a "clean slate" as possible, and to give you full control of its configuration. 

#### Entity Types

* \[FusionAuth Default] SCIM Client
* \[FusionAuth Default] SCIM Server

#### Email Templates

* \[FusionAuth Default] Breached Password Notification
