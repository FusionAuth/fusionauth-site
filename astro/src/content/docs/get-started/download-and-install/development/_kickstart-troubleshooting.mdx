### Kickstart is not running

If your Kickstart file doesn't run on your instance, here are some troubleshooting steps to take.

* Ensure you have provided a Kickstart JSON file via the [appropriate configuration parameter](/docs/reference/configuration). 
* Make sure the file is valid JSON, using a linter. 
* If the file references any other files (such as email templates), ensure they exist as well.
* Kickstart will not run if it sees any users, API keys, or applications in the FusionAuth database. This is to prevent data loss. If you can log in to the FusionAuth administrative user interface, Kickstart will not run.

Additionally, Kickstart takes time to run, depending on how many API calls you make and what kind of API calls they are. If you are starting up an instance with Kickstart and you visit the FusionAuth administrative user interface in your browser, you may see the Setup Wizard briefly while Kickstart is running. After Kickstart finishes, you should not see the Setup Wizard. This may require a browser refresh.

### Different entity types or templates exist in kickstarted instances of FusionAuth than clean installs

<Aside type="note">
  All lambda functions are present in both kickstart and clean installs of FusionAuth.

The following resources (all entity types, email templates, and most message templates) will not be present in a kickstarted instance of FusionAuth. The reason for this to allow full control (and consistency) over what data is seeded into a FusionAuth instance:

#### Entity Types

* \[FusionAuth Default] SCIM Client
* \[FusionAuth Default] SCIM Server

#### Email Templates

* \[FusionAuth Default] Breached Password Notification
* \[FusionAuth Default] Confirm Child Account
* \[FusionAuth Default] COPPA Notice
* \[FusionAuth Default] COPPA Notice Reminder
* \[FusionAuth Default] Email Verification
* \[FusionAuth Default] Forgot Password
* \[FusionAuth Default] Parent Registration
* \[FusionAuth Default] Passwordless Login
* \[FusionAuth Default] Registration Verification
* \[FusionAuth Default] Set up Password
* \[FusionAuth Default] Threat Detected
* \[FusionAuth Default] Two Factor Authentication
* \[FusionAuth Default] Two Factor Authentication Method Added
* \[FusionAuth Default] Two Factor Authentication Method Removed

#### Message Templates
* \[FusionAuth Default] Phone Forgot Password
* \[FusionAuth Default] Phone Passwordless Login
* \[FusionAuth Default] Phone Set up Password
* \[FusionAuth Default] Phone Threat Detected
* \[FusionAuth Default] Phone Two Factor Add
* \[FusionAuth Default] Phone Two Factor Remove

  The `Default Two Factor Request` message template is present in both kickstarted and clean installs of FusionAuth.
