FusionAuth lets you develop locally with a full featured auth system. To do so, [install FusionAuth](/docs/get-started/download-and-install) using one of the options, such as Homebrew or a .deb file.

There are situations where you want to expose your local FusionAuth instance to the internet. Some examples include:

* debugging an integration with an external system
* trying to show your custom themes to a developer on your team in a different office
* verifying the behavior of cookies over a secure connection without setting up certificates
* testing your login pages on a different device such as a phone or tablet

To help with these situations, use `ngrok`. This tool exposes your local FusionAuth instance and gives it a publicly accessible URL.

To set up `ngrok`, do the following:

* [download and install `ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/download) (free registration required)
* start your FusionAuth instance
* run `ngrok`: `ngrok http --request-header-add 'X-Forwarded-Port:443' 9011`

You need the request header argument to avoid proxy issues from FusionAuth.

You'll then see a screen similar to this.

```

If you are exposing a local web application as well as FusionAuth using `ngrok`, make sure you update your <InlineField>Authorized redirect URLs</InlineField> in the Application configuration.
