## Overview

FusionAuth has a model context protocol (MCP) server which allows you to query the the FusionAuth documentation using any MCP compatible client.

This server queries not only the technical FusionAuth documentation but other related material such as the FusionAuth Youtube channel, the GitHub issues repository, and the Terraform provider code.

You can use this MCP server to interact with the FusionAuth docs using natural language to:

* verify defaults and limitations
* find video or other resources for FusionAuth features
* learn about workarounds for known issues

The MCP server is located at:

```
https://ai.fusionauth.io/mcp/docs
```

The MCP server is accessed with the Streamable HTTP transport. No authentication is required to use this MCP server.

Please consult your MCP client documentation to configure this remote MCP server.
