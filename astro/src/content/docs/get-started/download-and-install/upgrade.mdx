The Fast Path commands can also be used to upgrade to the latest version of FusionAuth.  Follow the steps documented below.

### macOS and Linux
In this example, we'll assume you have previously installed FusionAuth in `/home/example/dev/fusionauth` (or somewhere in your home directory) and this directory will be referred to `FUSIONAUTH_HOME`. If you have used a different directory, you can adjust the following example accordingly.

```sh title="Shutdown FusionAuth"
# Stop Services
<FUSIONAUTH_HOME>/bin/shutdown.sh
```

Then, run the same FastPath command you ran above to install FusionAuth from the parent directory of `FUSIONAUTH_HOME` (if `FUSIONAUTH_HOME` is `/home/example/dev/fusionauth`, run the command from `/home/example/dev`).

After FusionAuth has been upgraded, you can start it again using the same start command from above as well. For example, on macOS you would run this command:

```sh title="Start FusionAuth"
# Start Services
<FUSIONAUTH_HOME>/bin/startup.sh
```

### Windows

Please note, that versions equal to `1.37.0` and less than `1.40.0` did not have a native Windows install option. It is recommended to plan to install version `1.40.0` or later.

In this example, we'll assume you have previously installed FusionAuth in `\Users\example\dev\fusionauth` and this directory will be referred to `FUSIONAUTH_HOME`. If you have used a different directory you can adjust the following example accordingly.

First, terminate the running FusionAuth App and Search services. Prior to version `1.40.0` if you are not using Windows services, you will need to manually end the FusionAuth process by closing the interactive command shell window. Beginning in version `1.40.0`, please utilize the following shutdown command.

```powershell title="Shutdown FusionAuth services"
# Stop Services
<FUSIONAUTH_HOME>\bin\shutdown.ps1
```

Then, run the same FastPath install command you ran above to install FusionAuth from the parent directory of `FUSIONAUTH_HOME` (if `FUSIONAUTH_HOME` is `\Users\example\dev\fusionauth`, run this command from `\Users\example\dev`).

After FusionAuth has been upgraded, you can start it again using the same start command from above as well. Prior to version `1.37.0`, the startup command will be named `startup.bat` instead of `startup.ps1`.

```powershell title="Start FusionAuth"
# Startup Services
<FUSIONAUTH_HOME>\bin\startup.ps1
```
