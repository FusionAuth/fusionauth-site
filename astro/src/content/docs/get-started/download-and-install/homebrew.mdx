## Homebrew Install

Homebrew is a macOS package manager, so if you're running macOS and you're familiar with Homebrew, we've got you covered. Our Homebrew formula is open source and available on GitHub.
https://github.com/FusionAuth/homebrew-fusionauth

To install FusionAuth using brew, first install the Tap, you will only need to do this step once.

```
brew tap fusionauth/homebrew-fusionauth
```

Next, install the FusionAuth services. Make sure you have `postgresql` up and running, optionally you can skip the `elasticsearch`/`opensearch` service if you would like to use the database as the User search engine, or if you already have a compatible Elasticsearch service running. See the [System Requirements](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/system-requirements) and [Configuration Reference](/docs/reference/configuration).

If you want to install the prerequisites with Homebrew check the [Prerequisites With Homebrew](#prerequisites-with-homebrew) section.

```
brew install fusionauth-app
```
That's it!  Now fire it up!

```
brew services start fusionauth-app
```

Now to get started open your browser to `http://localhost:9011`, and complete maintenance mode and the setup wizard.

If you want to run FusionAuth in silent mode, you can follow the instructions in the [Configure For Silent Configuration](#silent-configuration) section.

The shared configuration file will be located here: `/usr/local/etc/fusionauth/fusionauth.properties` and the logs are here : `/usr/local/var/log/fusionauth/`.

## Homebrew Upgrade

<UpgradeUsingBrew />

## Prerequisites With Homebrew

FusionAuth requires a database and a search engine. The recommended database is PostgreSQL, and the recommended search engine is OpenSearch.

### Postgres

If you don't have PostgreSQL installed, you can install it using Homebrew:

```bash
# Install PostgreSQL 16
brew install postgresql@16
# Check the service status
brew services info postgresql@16
# Start PostgreSQL 16 service
brew services start postgresql@16
```

To run the FusionAuth installation in silent mode, you need to create a PostgreSQL user and database for FusionAuth. You can do this with the following commands:

```bash
# Ensure the PostgreSQL binaries are in your PATH
export PATH="$PATH:$(brew --prefix postgresql@16)/bin"
# Create the fusionauth user fusionauth with password fusionauth
psql --command="CREATE USER fusionauth PASSWORD 'fusionauth'" --command="\du" postgres
# Create the fusionauth database owned by the fusionauth user
createdb --owner=fusionauth fusionauth
```

### OpenSearch

If you don't have OpenSearch installed, you can install it using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install opensearch
brew services info opensearch
brew services start opensearch
```

## Silent Configuration

After installing FusionAuth, you can configure it before starting the service to run a silent configuration. The configuration file is located at `$(brew --prefix)/etc/fusionauth/fusionauth.properties`.

```bash
# Add linebreak to the end of the fusionauth.properties file
echo "" >> $(brew --prefix)/etc/fusionauth/fusionauth.properties
# Add your kickstart file path
echo "fusionauth-app.kickstart.file=/path/to/your/kickstart/kickstart.json" >> $(brew --prefix)/etc/fusionauth/fusionauth.properties
# Add the silent mode property
echo "fusionauth-app.silent-mode=true" >> $(brew --prefix)/etc/fusionauth/fusionauth.properties
# Change the search.type=database to search.type=elasticsearch
sed -i '' 's/search.type=database/search.type=elasticsearch/g' $(brew --prefix)/etc/fusionauth/fusionauth.properties
# Add the open search URL
echo "search.servers=http://localhost:9200" >> $(brew --prefix)/etc/fusionauth/fusionauth.properties
# Check the full configuration
cat $(brew --prefix)/etc/fusionauth/fusionauth.properties
```
