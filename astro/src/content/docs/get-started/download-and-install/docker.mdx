FusionAuth Docker containers can be used with Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Helm or OpenShift. 

The following example is using Docker Compose. Here are [kubernetes installation instructions, which use Helm](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/kubernetes/). Find links for OpenShift and other community supported environments in the [FusionAuth Contrib](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-contrib) GitHub repo.

## Docker Compose

All of the FusionAuth Docker images may be found on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/fusionauth/).

The FusionAuth Docker Compose YAML files may be found on [FusionAuth containers repository](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers) and more examples in the [FusionAuth Docker Compose example repository](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-docker-compose) described in more detail below.

If you're looking for a complete configuration to get up and running quickly, use our Docker Compose example. `docker-compose.yml` will install FusionAuth with OpenSearch, but you can [switch between the different search engines](/docs/lifecycle/manage-users/search/switch-search-engines/).

### Installing FusionAuth

<DockerComposeFiles />

### The Docker Compose Files

The following is the default `docker-compose.yml` file, which installs FusionAuth.

<RemoteCode title="docker-compose.yml" url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/main/docker/fusionauth/docker-compose.yml" lang="yaml" />

## Docker Services

In the above example configurations there are three services:

* `database `
* `search`
* `fusionauth`

Let's look at each of these.

### Database Service

The database service provides a PostgreSQL database for use by FusionAuth.

You will need to either set the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variable in the `db` service section, or, more ideally, set the value in the host environment and only reference it in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

By default this database is not accessible outside of the Docker Compose containers, but you may expose the port if you want to examine the database by adding the ports mapping in the service definition.

Review the other properties to ensure they meet your requirements.

**Note:** If you plan to use MySQL please review the <ScrollRef target="Limitations" /> for the FusionAuth docker images.

### Search Service

<ElasticsearchVersion />

<ElasticsearchRam />

### The FusionAuth Service

This is the service that runs the FusionAuth application.

Review the [Configuration](/docs/reference/configuration#options) documentation to customize your deployment. The best way to configure FusionAuth when using Docker is to use environment variables as documented in that link.

In addition, the port `9011` is mapped between the container and your host machine. This may be modified if you want to run more than one FusionAuth instance or for any other reason.

### Other Services

You may add other services to the Docker Compose files if needed.

For example, in development environments it can be helpful to run [MailCatcher](https://mailcatcher.me/) which provides a local SMTP server. This allows FusionAuth to send transactional emails for account verification, password reset, and others.

<RemoteCode title="Example docker-compose.yml with mailcatcher" url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-docker-compose/main/mailcatcher/docker-compose.yml" lang="yaml" />

Below is a functional configuration on the tenant email tab based on the above configuration file:

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/download-and-install/tenant-mailcatcher-setting.png" alt="Tenant Setting With MailCatcher" width="1200"  role="bottom-cropped" />

This a view of the Mailcatcher client.

## Upgrading

<UpgradeUsingDocker />

### Migrations

If there were database migrations required, what happens on an upgrade depends on two settings: the runtime mode and the silent mode.

<Aside type="note">
Prior to version `1.19.0`, migration behavior was different. See below for more.
</Aside>

If silent mode is set to `true`, then database migrations will automatically be performed.

If silent mode is `false` and the runtime mode is set to `development`, then the [maintenance mode screen](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/fusionauth-app#maintenance-mode) will pop up and you will be prompted to complete the migrations there.

In all other cases the migrations will not be applied, and you'll have to perform them yourself. If you want to manage your own database upgrades, performing the SQL migrations out of band with another tool or process is a good option.

*When Are Database Migrations Applied*

| Runtime Mode  | Silent Mode | Migration Behavior                                                 |
|---------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `development` | `true`      | Migration applied automatically                                    |
| `development` | `false`     | Maintenance mode UI displayed, user prompted to run migrations     |
| `production`  | `true`      | Migration applied automatically                                    |
| `production`  | `false`     | Migration never applied by FusionAuth, must be applied out of band |

See the [configuration reference](/docs/reference/configuration) or the [silent mode guide](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/silent-mode) for more information. To apply the database migrations out of band see the [database upgrade](/docs/operate/deploy/upgrade#downtime-and-database-migrations) documentation.

#### Prior to 1.19

If the installation is in `production` mode, apply the migrations out of band. 

When running in development runtime mode, silent mode was enabled based upon the presence of environment variables, such as the database user, and could not explicitly be enabled or disabled. 

### Docker Tags

The Docker Compose file references the `latest` tag, but that tag is not dynamic. It is only the latest at a point in time. To get the most recently released image, you have a couple of options.

* Pull the latest image with this command: `docker pull fusionauth/fusionauth-app:latest` or `docker compose pull` and recreate your deployment with `docker compose up -d` which will recreate every container where a new image is available.
* Edit the Docker Compose file and specify a specific version. This is a good idea for a production deployment. With `docker compose pull` you can only pull the specified image, or just run `docker compose up -d` which will pull the image and recreate the container at the same time.
* Remove all images with `docker rmi <IMAGE ID>` selected from the list of IMAGE IDs which you can show with `docker images`. This requires that the image isn't used and therefore may prompt you to remove containers using it. Since all state of FusionAuth is stored in the database, and for docker you use volumes to persist data, you can safely remove the containers. After that you can use `docker compose pull`, `docker compose build` and `docker compose up -d` accordingly to get images specified the in the `docker-compose.yml`.

To generally clean up your images on your system ,`docker image prune` will remove all unused, dangling images.

## Custom Docker Images

If you want to build your own image starting with our base image, start with the `fusionauth/fusionauth-app` image. Just as the FusionAuth Docker image is based on an Ubuntu container image, you can build a Docker file which is based on the `fusionauth/fusionauth-app:latest` image. This can be useful if you want to permanently add a password hashing plugin, configuration file, or other customization to the image.

Here's a Dockerfile which extends the latest FusionAuth image:

<RemoteCode title="Example Dockerfile for building fusionauth-app including a plugin" url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-docker-compose/main/build/fusionauth-app/Dockerfile" lang="docker" />

Here's an example docker compose YAML file which uses this new image:

<RemoteCode title="Example docker-compose.yml for building fusionauth-app including a plugin" url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-docker-compose/main/build/docker-compose.yml" lang="yaml" />

With this example, you can use `docker compose build` to only run the build steps in the referenced Dockerfile. This will create you a custom Docker image which is consequentially used in the creation of the container in Docker Compose when running `docker compose up -d`. Alternatively you can run only `docker compose up -d` which will automatically take care of the build as well if not present.

By default the build process will cache a lot of the steps, to force a fresh build you can run `docker compose build --pull --no-cache` instead.

Here's the FusionAuth application Dockerfile as a reference which builds the `fusionauth/fusionauth-app` base image.

<RemoteCode title="The FusionAuth Docker file" url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/main/docker/fusionauth/fusionauth-app/Dockerfile" lang="docker" />

Here is [additional Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from).

## Kickstart

Using Docker with Kickstart is a powerful combination. Using these technologies together lets you:

* Configure and share development environments
* Create replicable bug reports 
* Spin up auth instances with a well known, versioned set of data for continuous integration and testing

All the normal limitations of Kickstart apply (the Kickstart will not run if the database has already been set up with an API key, for example).

It's easy to get started with Kickstart, but you'll need to tweak your Docker Compose files a bit. Before you begin, you'll need a valid `kickstart.json` file. Note that this file could be called anything, `kickstart.json` is simply a convention. Check out the [Kickstart documentation](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/kickstart) for more information on writing one.

Once you have a valid `kickstart.json` file, create a subdirectory in the location of your `docker-compose.yml` file. It can be named anything; this documentation will use a directory called `kickstart`. Next, you'll mount this directory and set the `FUSIONAUTH_APP_KICKSTART_FILE` variable in the `docker-compose.yml` file. 

Here are the steps to do so:

* In the `volumes:` section of the `fusionauth` service, add `- ./kickstart:/usr/local/fusionauth/kickstart`.
* Modify `.env` and add the Kickstart configuration variable: `FUSIONAUTH_APP_KICKSTART_FILE=/usr/local/fusionauth/kickstart/kickstart.json`. This path should be what the Docker container expects, not the path on the host.
* Configure `docker-compose.yml` to pass the environment variable set by `.env` to the container. Do this by adding `FUSIONAUTH_APP_KICKSTART_FILE: ${FUSIONAUTH_APP_KICKSTART_FILE}` to the `environment` section of the `fusionauth` service. 
* `docker compose up -d`

The following is an example `docker-compose.yml` file configuring FusionAuth to run the commands in a `kickstart.json` at startup.

<RemoteCode title="Example docker-compose.yml for running Kickstart" url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-docker-compose/main/kickstart/docker-compose.yml" lang="yaml" />

After running `docker compose up -d` you should see a line similar to the one below in the logs. These logs can be accessed using this command: `docker compose logs -f fusionauth`:

```plaintext title="FusionAuth log messages indicating Kickstart has succeeded"
io.fusionauth.api.service.system.kickstart.KickstartRunner - Summary
```

This indicates that Kickstart completed and provides a summary of the configuration changes made by it.

You may also want to check out [the Isolated Docker Setups](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-scripts/tree/main/isolated-docker-setup) if you want the ability to rapidly stand up different versions and configurations of FusionAuth.

If you want to test changes to your Kickstart file, you'll need to delete your volumes each time. Kickstart won't run except on a brand new install. If there is any data in the database, it won't proceed.

<Aside type="caution">
This will delete all data in your docker instance.
</Aside>

```plaintext title="Deleting the volumes"
docker compose down -v
```

## Plugins

Instead of building a custom docker image, you can directly mount a directory containing a plugin to your Docker container.

Here are the steps to do so:

* In the `volumes:` section of the `fusionauth` service, add `- ./plugins:/usr/local/fusionauth/plugins`.
* Copy your plugin jar file, created [by following the instructions](/docs/extend/code/password-hashes/), to your `plugins` directory on the host.
* `docker compose up -d`

The following is an example `docker-compose.yml` file configuring FusionAuth to scan for plugins at startup.

<RemoteCode title="Example docker-compose.yml for installing a plugin" url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-docker-compose/main/plugin/docker-compose.yml" lang="yaml" />

After running `docker compose up -d` you should see a line like this in the logs, which you can access using the command `docker compose logs -f fusionauth`:

```plaintext title="FusionAuth log messages indicating a plugin has been successfully installed"
INFO  io.fusionauth.api.plugin.guice.PluginModule - Installing plugin [com.mycompany.fusionauth.plugins.guice.MyExampleFusionAuthPluginModule]
INFO  io.fusionauth.api.plugin.guice.PluginModule - Plugin successfully installed
```

Such output indicates that the plugin has been installed and can be used.

## Accessing the Host Machine

The default FusionAuth Docker configuration sets up the network using the `bridge` configuration. This means that all the hosts defined by `docker-compose.yml` can access each other. However, it means that any applications running on your host machine cannot be accessed by FusionAuth using `localhost`.

This is typically only an issue when FusionAuth is accessing resources outside of the Docker network to, for example, send email or request a webhook. For example, if an application is running locally and you want FusionAuth, running in Docker, to send a webhook payload to it, configuring FusionAuth to send the webhook to `localhost` won't work. `localhost` in the Docker container refers to the Docker container itself, not the host machine.

In this situation, do one of the following:

* Run a container with your application in Docker, and use the appropriate network domain name.
* Install FusionAuth on the host machine and use `localhost`.
* Use an alias address, `host.docker.internal`, as the hostname instead of `localhost`.
  * For macOS and Windows hosts, you can use `host.docker.internal` without any additional configuration.
  * For Linux hosts, add the following lines to your `docker-compose.yml`.
```yaml
extra_hosts: 
  - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
```

Modifying the FusionAuth service in `docker-compose.yml` to use other Docker networking schemes such as `host` may work, but isn't fully tested or supported.

## OpenSearch Production Deployment Configuration

Production runtime requirements and configuration for OpenSearch will drastically differ from the Docker Compose examples as the examples are configured without any security or redundancy.

Please review the [Installing OpenSearch documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/install-and-configure/install-opensearch/index/) for further details around production deployment.

## Elasticsearch Production Deployment Configuration

Elasticsearch has a few runtime requirements that may not be met by default on your host platform. Please review the [Elasticsearch Docker production mode guide for more information](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.6/docker.html#docker-cli-run-prod-mode).

For example if startup is failing and you see the following in the logs, you will need to increase `vm.max_map_count` on your host VM.

```plaintext title="The log message when max_map_count is too low"
2018-11-22T12:32:06.779828954Z Nov 22, 2018 12:32:06.779 PM ERROR c.inversoft.maintenance.search.ElasticsearchSilentConfigurationWorkflowTask

```

## Limitations

Due to Oracle licensing restrictions, the docker images published on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fusionauth/fusionauth-app) do not contain the necessary software to connect to a MySQL database.

If you wish to use MySQL, you'll need to build a custom container that includes the MySQL Connector JAR file. Here is an example container definition that uses the FusionAuth image as a base layer and adds the MySQL connector.

<RemoteCode title="Example Dockerfile which downloads the MySQL connector" lang="docker" url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/main/docker/fusionauth/fusionauth-app-mysql/Dockerfile" />
