All of the FusionAuth Docker images live on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/fusionauth/). FusionAuth Docker containers can be used with Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Helm or OpenShift.

## Installation

This installation guide will mostly uses Docker Compose. Here are [kubernetes installation instructions, which use Helm](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/kubernetes/). Find links for OpenShift and other community supported environments in the [FusionAuth Contrib](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-contrib) GitHub repo.

The FusionAuth Docker Compose YAML files live in the [FusionAuth containers repository](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers). Our Docker Compose file is designed to include the core FusionAuth application, a database, a search engine, and a way to start numerous optional services using profiles. We'll go over a number of the optional services below.

If you're looking for a complete guide to get up and running quickly, follow our [Getting Started guide](/docs/get-started/start-here/step-1). This will walk you through installing FusionAuth, configuring it using [Kickstart](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/kickstart), and using an example application to illustrate core concepts such as login, logout, and access control.

## Docker Compose Files

The following is our standard `docker-compose.yml` file, which installs FusionAuth and provides a number of optional services as well:

<RemoteCode title="docker-compose.yml" url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/main/docker/fusionauth/docker-compose.yml" lang="yaml" />

## Docker Services

In our standard Docker Compose file there are three core services that are always installed and started:

* `db`
* `search`
* `fusionauth`

Let's look at each of these along with the optional services below.

### Database Service

The database service provides a PostgreSQL database for use by FusionAuth. This service is configured using the `.env` file that you downloaded above. The `.env` file comes out of the box with a default username and password for PostgreSQL. You can change these if you would like.

By default this database is not accessible outside of the Docker Compose containers, but you may expose the port if you want to examine the database by adding the ports mapping in the service definition.

Review the other properties to ensure they meet your requirements.

**Note:** If you plan to use MySQL please review the [Limitations](#limitations) for the FusionAuth docker images.

### Search Service

The search service provides an Open Search service for use by FusionAuth. This service doesn't require any configuration and FusionAuth will use it automatically.

If you would like to use the database search engine instead, you can delete the search service from the `docker-compose.yml` file and change the `FUSIONAUTH_SEARCH_TYPE` environment variable in the `.env` file to `database`.

<ElasticsearchRam />

### FusionAuth Service

This is the service that runs the FusionAuth application.

Review the [Configuration](/docs/reference/configuration#options) documentation to customize your deployment. The best way to configure FusionAuth when using Docker is to use environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file or predefined variables in the `.env` file.

In addition, the port `9011` is mapped between the container and your host machine. You can change this port as needed.

### Caddy Service

The Docker Compose file includes an optional definition for a Caddy service that acts as a proxy for FusionAuth. To start the Caddy service, you must supply the `caddy` profile like this:

```shell
docker compose up --profile caddy
```

The Caddy service is preconfigured to listen on ports `80` and `443`. You might need to ensure the user that is running Docker Compose has the correct privileges to bind those ports. Additionally, you might need to configure Caddy with a TLS certificate for it to properly server traffic over `https` on port `443`.

### MailCatcher

The Docker Compose file includes an optional definition for a MailCatcher service. This service is a quick and easy way to provide an SMTP server that FusionAuth can use when sending emails. This is an excellent way to test FusionAuth's email capabilities without configuring a full SMTP server. To start the MailCatcher service, you must supply the `mailcatcher` profile like this:

```shell
docker compose up --profile mailcatcher
```

You should review the [MailCatcher documentation](https://mailcatcher.me) to learn how to integrate it with FusionAuth and also how to review emails it receives. Here is an example configuration that connects FusionAuth to MailCatcher on the default Tenant:

This a view of the Mailcatcher client.

### Kafka

The Kafka service starts a Kafka messaging server that allows FusionAuth to integrate with Kafka as a Webhook delivery location. Kafka also requires Zookeeper, which is started in conjunction with Kafka under this profile. To start the Kafka service, you must supply the `kafka` profile like this:

```shell
docker compose up --profile kafka
```

### Cleanspeak

The [Cleanspeak](https://cleanspeak.com) service starts Cleanspeak such that it can be integrated with FusionAuth. Cleanspeak provides content [filtering and moderation capabilities](https://cleanspeak.com/features) and FusionAuth can leverage Cleanspeak to ensure that usernames and profile data don't contain any inappropriate user-generated content (UGC). To start the Cleanspeak service, you must supply the `cleanspeak` profile like this:

```shell
docker compose up --profile cleanspeak
```

Cleanspeak requires an additional license, but can be bundled with a FusionAuth license at the same time. Contact your FusionAuth sales representative to learn more about Cleanspeak. Or use [our contact us form](/contact) to contact our sales team.

### Multiple profiles

Docker Compose supports starting multiple profiles at the same time. To accomplish this, pass in the `--profile` option multiple times like this:

```shell
docker compose up --profile mailcatcher --profile kafka
```

## Upgrading

<UpgradeUsingDocker/>

### Migrations

If there were database migrations required, what happens on an upgrade depends on two settings: the runtime mode and the silent mode.

<Aside type="note">
Prior to version `1.19.0`, migration behavior was different. See below for more.
</Aside>

If silent mode is set to `true`, then database migrations will automatically be performed.

If silent mode is `false` and the runtime mode is set to `development`, then the [maintenance mode screen](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/fusionauth-app#maintenance-mode) will pop up and you will be prompted to complete the migrations there.

In all other cases the migrations will not be applied, and you'll have to perform them yourself. If you want to manage your own database upgrades, performing the SQL migrations out of band with another tool or process is a good option.

*When Are Database Migrations Applied*

| Runtime Mode  | Silent Mode | Migration Behavior                                                 |
|---------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `development` | `true`      | Migration applied automatically                                    |
| `development` | `false`     | Maintenance mode UI displayed, user prompted to run migrations     |
| `production`  | `true`      | Migration applied automatically                                    |
| `production`  | `false`     | Migration never applied by FusionAuth, must be applied out of band |

See the [configuration reference](/docs/reference/configuration) or the [silent mode guide](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/silent-mode) for more information. To apply the database migrations out of band see the [database upgrade](/docs/operate/deploy/upgrade#downtime-and-database-migrations) documentation.

#### Prior to 1.19

If the installation is in `production` mode, apply the migrations out of band. 

When running in development runtime mode, silent mode was enabled based upon the presence of environment variables, such as the database user, and could not explicitly be enabled or disabled. 

### Docker Tags

The Docker Compose file references the `latest` tag, but that tag is not dynamic. It is only the latest at a point in time. To get the most recently released image, you have a couple of options.

* Pull the latest image with this command: `docker pull fusionauth/fusionauth-app:latest` or `docker compose pull` and recreate your deployment with `docker compose up -d` which will recreate every container where a new image is available.
* Edit the Docker Compose file and specify a specific version. This is a good idea for a production deployment. With `docker compose pull` you can only pull the specified image, or just run `docker compose up -d` which will pull the image and recreate the container at the same time.
* Remove all images with `docker rmi <IMAGE ID>` selected from the list of IMAGE IDs which you can show with `docker images`. This requires that the image isn't used and therefore may prompt you to remove containers using it. Since all state of FusionAuth is stored in the database, and for docker you use volumes to persist data, you can safely remove the containers. After that you can use `docker compose pull`, `docker compose build` and `docker compose up -d` accordingly to get images specified the in the `docker-compose.yml`.

To generally clean up your images on your system ,`docker image prune` will remove all unused, dangling images.

## Custom Docker Images

If you want to build your own image starting with our base image, start with the `fusionauth/fusionauth-app` image. Just as the FusionAuth Docker image is based on an Ubuntu container image, you can build a Docker file which is based on the `fusionauth/fusionauth-app:latest` image. This can be useful if, for example, you want to add a password hashing plugin, configuration file, or other customization to the image.

Here's a Dockerfile which extends the latest FusionAuth image:

```dockerfile
FROM maven AS build
WORKDIR /app
RUN git init . &&\
  git remote add -t \* -f origin https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-password-encryptor.git &&\
  git checkout master &&\
  mvn compile package

FROM fusionauth/fusionauth-app:latest
COPY --chown=fusionauth:fusionauth --from=build /app/target/fusionauth-example-password-encryptor*.jar /usr/local/fusionauth/plugins/
```

Here's an snippet from a Docker Compose YAML file that uses this new image:

```dockerfile
version: '3'

# ...

  fusionauth:
    #image: fusionauth/fusionauth-app:latest
    build: ./fusionauth-app

# ...
```

With this example, you can use `docker compose build` to only run the build steps in the referenced Dockerfile. This will create a custom Docker image that is used when Docker Compose is started using the command `docker compose up -d`. Alternatively you can run only `docker compose up -d`, which will automatically take care of the build, if it hasn't been completed yet.

By default the build process will cache a lot of the steps, to force a fresh build you can run `docker compose build --pull --no-cache` instead.

You can view the full Dockerfile for FusionAuth at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/main/docker/fusionauth/fusionauth-app/Dockerfile.

## Kickstart

Using Docker with [Kickstart](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/kickstart) is a powerful combination. Using these technologies together lets you:

* Configure and share development environments
* Create replicable bug reports 
* Spin up auth instances with a well known, versioned set of data for continuous integration and testing

All the normal limitations of Kickstart apply (the Kickstart will not run if the database has already been set up with an API key, for example).

It's easy to get started with Kickstart using our standard Docker Compose file. This file provides a default location for a Kickstart file of `./kickstart/kickstart.json`. Depending where your current working directory is, you might be able to place any Kickstart file(s) in this directory and FusionAuth will automatically use it.

You can also change the location of the Kickstart files by editing the `.env` file and changing the variable `FUSIONAUTH_LOCAL_KICKSTART_DIRECTORY`.

To verify that Kickstart runs correctly, we recommend starting Docker Compose in the foreground (or tailing the logs) and looking for this output in the logs:

```log title="FusionAuth log messages indicating Kickstart has succeeded"
fusionauth-1  | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
fusionauth-1  | -------------------------------------------- Kickstarting 🤘 --------------------------------------------
fusionauth-1  | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

This indicates that Kickstart completed and provides a summary of the configuration changes made by it.

You may also want to check out [the Isolated Docker Setups](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-scripts/tree/main/isolated-docker-setup) if you want the ability to rapidly stand up different versions and configurations of FusionAuth.

If you want to test changes to your Kickstart file, you'll need to delete your volumes each time. Kickstart won't run except on a brand new install. If there is any data in the database, it won't proceed.

<Aside type="caution">
This will delete all data in your docker instance.
</Aside>

```plaintext title="Deleting the volumes"
docker compose down -v
```

## Plugins

Instead of building a custom docker image, you can directly mount a directory containing a plugin to your Docker container. The standard FusionAuth Docker Compose file specifies the location of plugin files as `./plugins`. If you copy any plugin JAR files into this directory, FusionAuth will automatically load them.

You can also change the location of the plugin directory by editing the `.env` file and changing the variable `FUSIONAUTH_LOCAL_PLUGIN_DIRECTORY`

To verify that FusionAuth has loaded your plugins, we recommend starting Docker Compose in the foreground (or tailing the logs) and looking for this output in the logs:

```plaintext title="FusionAuth log messages indicating a plugin has been successfully installed"
INFO  io.fusionauth.api.plugin.guice.PluginModule - Installing plugin [com.mycompany.fusionauth.plugins.guice.MyExampleFusionAuthPluginModule]
INFO  io.fusionauth.api.plugin.guice.PluginModule - Plugin successfully installed
```

This output indicates that the plugin has been installed.

## Accessing the Host Machine

The default FusionAuth Docker configuration sets up the network using the `bridge` configuration. This means that all the hosts defined by `docker-compose.yml` can access each other. However, it means that any applications running on your host machine cannot be accessed by FusionAuth using `localhost`.

This is typically only an issue when FusionAuth is accessing resources outside of the Docker network. For example, you might want to use a database on the host machine rather than the databse in the Docker Compose. Or you might want to connect to an SMTP server on the host machine. Configuring FusionAuth to use `localhost` won't work. `localhost` in the Docker container refers to the Docker container itself, not the host machine.

To access the host machine, you can use the DNS name `host.docker.internal`. This will allow the Docker container to access the host machine.

You can also deploy another container into the Docker Compose or use a different installation method for FusionAuth.

NOTE: If you are running Linux, you might need to add these lines to your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
extra_hosts: 
  - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
```

## OpenSearch Production Deployment Configuration

Production runtime requirements and configuration for OpenSearch will drastically differ from the Docker Compose examples as the examples are configured without any security or redundancy.

Please review the [Installing OpenSearch documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/install-and-configure/install-opensearch/index/) for further details around production deployment.

## Elasticsearch Production Deployment Configuration

Elasticsearch has a few runtime requirements that may not be met by default on your host platform. Please review the [Elasticsearch Docker production mode guide for more information](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.6/docker.html#docker-cli-run-prod-mode).

For example if startup is failing and you see the following in the logs, you will need to increase `vm.max_map_count` on your host VM.

```plaintext title="The log message when max_map_count is too low"
2018-11-22T12:32:06.779828954Z Nov 22, 2018 12:32:06.779 PM ERROR c.inversoft.maintenance.search.ElasticsearchSilentConfigurationWorkflowTask

```

## Limitations

Due to Oracle licensing restrictions, the docker images published on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fusionauth/fusionauth-app) do not contain the necessary software to connect to a MySQL database.

If you wish to use MySQL, you'll need to build a custom container that includes the MySQL Connector JAR file. Here is an example container definition that uses the FusionAuth image as a base layer and adds the MySQL connector:

<RemoteCode title="Example Dockerfile which downloads the MySQL connector" lang="docker" url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/main/docker/fusionauth/fusionauth-app-mysql/Dockerfile" />
