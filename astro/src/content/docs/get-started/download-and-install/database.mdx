## Install a Database

<Aside type="note">
If you already have a PostgreSQL database installed that you will be using with FusionAuth, you can skip this section completely. If you are using MySQL and already have MySQL installed, you will still need to install the MySQL Connector to ensure FusionAuth works properly.
</Aside>

In order to use FusionAuth, you need to install a database. The database requirements are provided in the [System Requirements](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/system-requirements).
 Follow the instructions below to install a supported database.

### Install MySQL

<Aside type="note">
IBM Compose for MySQL or other MysQL platforms that utilize MySQL Group Replication are not supported.
</Aside>

#### Linux

To install MySQL on a Linux system, you can use the `apt` or `yum` tools depending on whether or not your Linux distribution is based on Red Hat or Debian. The package name may vary depending on your platform, for example: `mysql-server` or `mysql-server-5.7`. Here's the commands for each:

```bash title="Red Hat"
yum install mysql-server
```

```bash title="Debian"
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
```

#### Windows or macOS

If you are installing MySQL on a platform that does not supports RPM or DEB packages, you will need to download the installer from the MySQL website here: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

#### MySQL and Unicode

<Aside type="note">
To properly store 4 byte Unicode, the character set must be set to `utf8mb4`.

By default this configuration is enforced during startup. If FusionAuth fails to startup due to this validation the log will contain detailed
messages about the MySQL configuration.

It is recommended to ensure you have properly configured MySQL to use `utf8mb4` before attempting to startup FusionAuth. Please verify you have
the following configuration in your `my.cnf` file. On Windows the file is called `my.ini`.

If you need to modify your configuration, restart MySQL for the changes to take effect.
</Aside>

```ini title="my.cnf"
[client]
default-character-set = utf8mb4

[mysql]
default-character-set = utf8mb4

[mysqld]
character-set-client-handshake = FALSE
character-set-server = utf8mb4
collation-server = utf8mb4_bin
```

This is a system wide configuration option, so be certain that other databases and applications on the same MySQL server won't be impacted by this change.
It is possible not all of these configuration options will be available depending on your database configuration. Once you have configured the available
options, if startup still fails due to this validation you may disable this feature. See `database.mysql.enforce-utf8mb4` in the [Configuration](/docs/reference/configuration) reference.

### Install MySQL Connector

In order to use MySQL with FusionAuth, you also need to download and install the MySQL Connector for Java. This is a manual process due to the way that Oracle licenses MySQL. Follow these steps to get the MySQL Connector into the correct location for FusionAuth to use.

1. Download the MySQL Connector version 8.0.23 or newer using the Platform Independent installer from the Oracle website here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/8.0.html
2. Unzip or untar the archive you downloaded
3. Copy the file from the archive named `mysql-connector-java-<version>.jar` to the FusionAuth app library directory. This directory is located in the installation directory at `fusionauth-app/lib`. For example, if you installed using the DEB package on a Debian Linux system, this location will be `/usr/local/fusionauth/fusionauth-app/lib`

### Install PostgreSQL

#### Linux

To install PostgreSQL on a Linux system, you can use the `apt` or `yum` tools depending on whether or not your Linux distribution is based
on Red Hat or Debian. The package name may vary depending on your platform.

```bash title="Red Hat"
sudo yum install postgresql-server postgresql
sudo yum install postgresql9-contrib.x86_64
```

```bash title="Debian"
sudo apt-get install postgresql-server
sudo apt-get install postgresql-contrib
```

#### Windows or macOS

If you are installing PostgreSQL on a platform that does not support RPM or DEB packages, you will need to download the installer from the PostgreSQL website here: https://www.postgresql.org
