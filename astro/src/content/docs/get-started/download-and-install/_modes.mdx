**Q:** What is runtime mode and how does it affect upgrades? \
**A:** FusionAuth runtime mode can be either `production` or `development`. When in the `development` runtime mode, Maintenance Mode will interactively assist you to configure the database and connect to Elasticsearch, if configured. Once you move FusionAuth into production, it is recommended that you modify the runtime mode to `production`. When in `production` runtime mode, Maintenance Mode will no longer be available to you, which means you can be certain that your end users will not find themselves on the database upgrade panel during an upgrade. When in `production` mode, you will either need to leverage Silent Mode to automatically apply database migrations or you will need to apply the database migrations yourself (either by hand or via a script of some sort). For more on runtime modes, see the [FusionAuth Installation Guide](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/fusionauth-app#runtime-modes).

**Q:** What is Maintenance Mode? \
**A:** Maintenance Mode is a special admin interface for FusionAuth installations in development environments. Maintenance Mode helps you to interactively upgrade FusionAuth or set up database connections. You can switch to Maintenance Mode by switching to the `development` runtime mode and setting Silent Mode to false. Note that Maintenance Mode should never be used in production.

**Q:** What is Silent Mode? \
**A:** [Silent Mode](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/silent-mode) is a feature of FusionAuth that automatically applies database migrations. This is useful for automated deployments. Silent Mode can be enabled in the `development` runtime mode and, as of version `1.19.0`, in the `production` runtime mode too. Silent Mode will attempt to perform database migrations on startup. If the database migrations fail, FusionAuth will display an error message on the login page. You should always test your database migrations in a non-production or staging environment before deploying to production.
