## Install

These commands will download and unpack the latest version of FusionAuth.

By default, FusionAuth installs leverage the database as the User search engine. You may optionally also install and configure Elasticsearch to leverage advanced search functionality.

<Aside type="note">
Optionally, provide the following environment variables to the install script to augment behavior:

* `TARGET_DIR` - The location to install the zip. Default value is $PWD/fusionauth.
* `VERSION` - The version to install. Defaults to the latest stable version.
