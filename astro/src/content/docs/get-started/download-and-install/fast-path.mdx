## Fast Path Install

Want to get up and running super fast on your dev box or server? Use our awesome download scripts and you'll be coding in no time. These commands will download and unpack the latest version of FusionAuth.

By default, FusionAuth installs leveraging the database as the User search engine.  You may optionally also install and configure Elasticsearch to leverage advanced search functionality.  Commands for both configurations are provided below.

### Environment Variables
The following environment variables may be provided to the install script to augment behavior.

* `TARGET_DIR` - The location to install the zip. Default value is $PWD/fusionauth.
* `VERSION` - The version to install. Defaults to the latest stable version.

## Fast Path Upgrade

The Fast Path commands can also be used to upgrade to the latest version of FusionAuth.  Follow the steps documented below.

### macOS and Linux
In this example, we'll assume you have previously installed FusionAuth in `/home/example/dev/fusionauth` (or somewhere in your home directory) and this directory will be referred to `FUSIONAUTH_HOME`. If you have used a different directory, you can adjust the following example accordingly.

```sh title="Shutdown FusionAuth"
# Stop Services
<FUSIONAUTH_HOME>/bin/shutdown.sh
```

Then, run the same FastPath command you ran above to install FusionAuth from the parent directory of `FUSIONAUTH_HOME` (if `FUSIONAUTH_HOME` is `/home/example/dev/fusionauth`, run the command from `/home/example/dev`).

After FusionAuth has been upgraded, you can start it again using the same start command from above as well. For example, on macOS you would run this command:

```sh title="Start FusionAuth"
# Start Services
<FUSIONAUTH_HOME>/bin/startup.sh
```

### Windows

Please note, that versions equal to `1.37.0` and less than `1.40.0` did not have a native Windows install option. It is recommended to plan to install version `1.40.0` or later.

In this example, we'll assume you have previously installed FusionAuth in `\Users\example\dev\fusionauth` and this directory will be referred to `FUSIONAUTH_HOME`. If you have used a different directory you can adjust the following example accordingly.

First, terminate the running FusionAuth App and Search services. Prior to version `1.40.0` if you are not using Windows services, you will need to manually end the FusionAuth process by closing the interactive command shell window. Beginning in version `1.40.0`, please utilize the following shutdown command.

```sh title="Shutdown FusionAuth services"
# Stop Services
<FUSIONAUTH_HOME>\bin\shutdown.ps1
```

Then, run the same FastPath install command you ran above to install FusionAuth from the parent directory of `FUSIONAUTH_HOME` (if `FUSIONAUTH_HOME` is `\Users\example\dev\fusionauth`, run this command from `\Users\example\dev`).

After FusionAuth has been upgraded, you can start it again using the same start command from above as well. Prior to version `1.37.0`, the startup command will be named `startup.bat` instead of `startup.ps1`.

```sh title="Start FusionAuth"
# Startup Services
<FUSIONAUTH_HOME>\bin\startup.ps1
```
