Kubernetes is an extensible and open-source container-orchestration system used for automating application deployments. Some of the most notable features it provides include self-healing, auto-scaling, and automated rollouts and rollbacks.

Since the Kubernetes container runtime supports [Docker](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/docker), FusionAuth [Docker](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/docker) containers can be deployed to any Kubernetes cluster.

The following guide demonstrates how to deploy FusionAuth containers using [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/), the Kubernetes command-line tool that enables you to send commands to a cluster through the [API server](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/).
You'll need a cluster running to work through this guide.

## Requirements

* `kubectl` - Command line tool that interacts with the Kubernetes API server and is useful for managing Kubernetes clusters. Before proceeding, follow the [installation documentation that corresponds to your platform](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).
This guide will be using version `1.22`.
* `helm` - Package manager used for installing and managing Kubernetes applications. In this guide, you will be using a Helm chart to install FusionAuth on our Kubernetes cluster. For more information, see [Installing Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).
This guide will be using version `3.6.4`.
* An available Kubernetes cluster. If you need to set up a cluster, we have provided the below installation guides for both local development environments and the major cloud providers. Each provides step-by-step instructions intended to get you up and running as fast as possible.
  * [Local setup using minikube](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/kubernetes/minikube)
  * [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/kubernetes/eks)
  * [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/kubernetes/gke)
  * [Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/kubernetes/aks)

## Adding the Helm Chart Repository

To get started, the first thing to do is add the FusionAuth Helm Chart repository. This can be done with the following.

```shell title="Add a chart repository"
helm repo add fusionauth https://fusionauth.github.io/charts
```

To view the list of repositories that you have added use the following command:

```plaintext title="List chart repositories"
helm repo list
```

```plaintext title="Output from listing chart repositories"
NAME      	URL
fusionauth	https://fusionauth.github.io/charts
```

To search repositories:

```shell title="Search chart repositories"
helm search repo fusionauth
```

```shell title="Output from search"
NAME                 	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION
fusionauth/fusionauth	0.10.5       	1.30.1     	Helm chart for fusionauth
```

## Helm Chart Configuration

Before you install, configure the `values.yaml` file contents used by the Helm Chart. The majority of the values for this chart have defaults recommended by FusionAuth but you will want to review and modify the configuration to meet your specific requirements.

To update this file, first download it:

```shell title="Download chart values"
curl -o values.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/charts/main/chart/values.yaml
```

Open `values.yaml` with your favorite text editor and modify it. This guide covers configuration values which must be updated to deploy FusionAuth. You should review the entire configuration to understand all the possible options.

### Replicas

The <InlineField>replicaCount</InlineField> value indicates the number of instances of FusionAuth to run in a [ReplicaSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/).
Kubernetes will monitor the cluster to ensure that this number of instances of FusionAuth is running at all times.

By default, the <InlineField>replicaCount</InlineField> value is set to `1` which typically works well for development and testing environments, but you will likely want to adjust this based on your system and application requirements.

```yaml title="Replica count example configuration"
# replicaCount -- The number of fusionauth-app instances to run
replicaCount: 1
```

### Docker Image

The most current helm chart will always point to the latest version of FusionAuth.
For this guide, FusionAuth version `1.30.1` is used.
You can update this to any released version you'd like.
You can find the [list of FusionAuth releases here](https://hub.docker.com/r/fusionauth/fusionauth-app/tags).

```yaml title="Image configuration example"
image:
  # image.repository -- The name of the docker repository for fusionauth-app
  repository: fusionauth/fusionauth-app
  # image.repository -- The docker tag to pull for fusionauth-app
  tag: 1.30.1
```

### Extra Containers

You may want to inject a sidecar or ambassador container.
This is useful if you want to, for instance, proxy requests to FusionAuth to put it at a different path or limit the IP addresses which have access to the administrative user interface.
You can do this with the `extraContainers` value.
Containers defined here will be added to the FusionAuth pod.

```yaml title="Default extraContainers"
extraContainers: []
```

```yaml title="extraContainers with an nginx sidecar"
extraContainers:
  - name: my-sidecar
    image: nginx:latest
```

You can find [community contributed proxy configurations here](https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-contrib).

### Database Configuration

Now, configure the database connection. Each of our FusionAuth pods will use this configuration when communicating with the database.

The following is an example of the `database` configuration section in `values.yaml`:

```yaml title="Database and search example configuration"
database:
  # database.protocol -- Should either be postgresql or mysql. Protocol for jdbc connection to database
  protocol: postgresql
  # database.host -- Hostname or ip of the database instance
  host: ""
  # database.host -- Port of the database instance
  port: 5432
  # database.tls -- Configures whether or not to use tls when connecting to the database
  tls: false
  # database.tlsMode -- If tls is enabled, this configures the mode
  tlsMode: require
  # database.name -- Name of the fusionauth database
  name: fusionauth

  # To use an existing secret, set `existingSecret` to the name of the secret. We expect at most two keys: `password` is required. `rootpassword` is only required if `database.root.user` is set.
  # database.existingSecret -- The name of an existing secret that contains the database passwords
  existingSecret: ""
  # database.user -- Database username for fusionauth to use in normal operation
  user: ""
  # database.password -- Database password for fusionauth to use in normal operation - not required if database.existingSecret is configured
  password: ""
  # These credentials are used for bootstrapping the database and creating it if needed. This can be useful for ephemeral clusters used for testing and dev.
  root:
    # database.root.user -- Database username for fusionauth to use during initial bootstrap - not required if you have manually bootstrapped your database
    user: ""
    # database.root.password -- Database password for fusionauth to use during initial bootstrap - not required if database.existingSecret is configured
    password: ""

search:
  # search.engine -- Defines backend for fusionauth search capabilities. Valid values for engine are 'elasticsearch' or 'database'.
  engine: elasticsearch
  # search.engine -- Protocol to use when connecting to elasticsearch. Ignored when search.engine is NOT elasticsearch
  protocol: http
  # search.host -- Hostname or ip to use when connecting to elasticsearch. Ignored when search.engine is NOT elasticsearch
  host: ""
  # search.port -- Port to use when connecting to elasticsearch. Ignored when search.engine is NOT elasticsearch
  port: 9200
  # search.user -- Username to use with basic auth when connecting to elasticsearch. Ignored when search.engine is NOT elasticsearch
  user: ""
  # search.password -- Password to use with basic auth when connecting to elasticsearch. Ignored when search.engine is NOT elasticsearch
  password: ""
```

For this guide, the following attributes need to be retrieved from your database and Elasticsearch deployments and updated in your `values.yaml` configuration.

<Aside type="note">
FusionAuth requires an external database and, optionally an external Elasticsearch cluster.
Setting these up is outside of the scope of this document.

Consult the setup guides for instructions for AWS, GCP, and more.
</Aside>

* `database.host`
* `database.root.user`
* `database.root.password`

The FusionAuth standard user will be created with the credentials provided here when you install the FusionAuth helm chart.

* `database.user`
* `database.password`

If <InlineField>search.engine</InlineField> is set to `elasticsearch`:

* `search.host`

Additionally, you may set these values if a username/password are needed to access Elasticsearch (these are not required for this tutorial):

* `search.user`
* `search.password`

If you don't want to provide the `database.root.user` and `database.root.password` to allow FusionAuth to set up the database itself, you can also follow the [advanced database installation guide](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/fusionauth-app#advanced-installation) which lets you set up the database out of band.

## Deploy FusionAuth To the Cluster

Now that `values.yaml` is updated, it is time to install the chart on the cluster. The `helm install` command is used to install a chart by name and can be applied using the syntax:

```shell title="Helm install format"
helm install [CHART NAME] [CHART] [flags]
```

Here you will install a chart including the `-f` flag to override the default values.

```shell title="Install the FusionAuth chart"
helm install my-release fusionauth/fusionauth -f values.yaml
```

<Aside type="note">
You can apply override values by modifying the `values.yaml` configuration that you pass when installing a chart or by using the `--set` flag on the command line.
Using `--set` can be useful when developing scripts or command line tools. Either method is acceptable.
</Aside>

If the previous command was successful, you should see output similar to the following:

```plaintext title="Example output"
NAME: my-release
LAST DEPLOYED: Sun Oct 10 19:23:41 2021
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
NOTES:
1. Get the application URL by running these commands:
  export SVC_NAME=$(kubectl get svc --namespace default -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=fusionauth,app.kubernetes.io/instance=my-release" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
  echo "Visit http://127.0.0.1:9011 to use your application"
  kubectl port-forward svc/$SVC_NAME 9011:9011
```

You can get the status of your deployment with `kubectl`.

```shell title="Get a list of deployments running on the cluster"
kubectl get deployments -o wide
```

```plaintext title="Output"
NAME                    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE     CONTAINERS   IMAGES                             SELECTOR
my-release-fusionauth   1/1     1            1           4m16s   fusionauth   fusionauth/fusionauth-app:1.30.1   app.kubernetes.io/instance=my-release,app.kubernetes.io/name=fusionauth
```

As instructed by the success message output above, you can create a proxy enabling you to connect to the cluster from `localhost`:

```shell title="Setup port-forwarding proxy"
export SVC_NAME=$(kubectl get svc --namespace default -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=fusionauth,app.kubernetes.io/instance=my-release" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
  echo "Visit http://127.0.0.1:9011 to use your application"
  kubectl port-forward svc/$SVC_NAME 9011:9011
```

```plaintext title="Example output of kubectl proxying command"
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:9011 -> 9011
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:9011` and you will land on the FusionAuth Setup Wizard. For a complete tutorial walking you through the initial FusionAuth configuration, see [Setup Wizard & First Login](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/setup-wizard/).

## Create an Ingress

If you want to connect FusionAuth with an external network, the last thing you need to do is to configure the cluster to be able to receive external requests. You might do this if you were using FusionAuth to authenticate users connecting to applications from the internet. On the other hand, you might not do this if you were using FusionAuth solely within your kubernetes cluster.

To direct external traffic to your cluster, you will use an [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/), a component that defines how external traffic should be handled, and an [Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/) that implements those rules.

### Deploy an Ingress Resource

Create a file named `ingress.yaml` and copy and paste the following resource configuration:

```yaml title="Ingress resource configuration"
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-release-fusionauth
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: fusionauth
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: my-release-fusionauth
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: my-release-fusionauth
            port:
              number: 9011
        path: /
        pathType: Prefix
```

The rules for this Ingress resource indicate that requests from the root path context, or `/`, should be directed to the `my-release-fusionauth` service.

Now apply this configuration on the cluster:

```shell title="Apply Ingress resource"
kubectl apply -f ./ingress.yaml
```

### Install an Ingress Controller

For this guide, you will use the NGINX Ingress controller. To install the Ingress controller, add the [nginx-ingress](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx) repository and install the Helm chart by running the following commands:

```shell title="Add ingress-nginx chart repository"
helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
```

```shell title="Install ingress-nginx chart"
helm install fa-loadbalancer ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx
```

When completed, get the active services running on the cluster:

```shell title="Get services information"
kubectl get services
```

```plaintext title="Services response output"
NAME                                            TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP                                                                  PORT(S)                      AGE
fusionauth-ingress-nginx-controller             LoadBalancer   10.100.246.131   a4413292c6477456b8c1cde8f5260513-137482286.us-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com       80:30048/TCP,443:32484/TCP   37m
```

A new service will be available of type `LoadBalancer` and will contain an external IP or host name corresponding to a newly provisioned Elastic Load Balancer host name. External traffic will now be directed to the Kubernetes cluster via this ingress.

<Aside type="note">
If you have completed this tutorial using minikube, you can access the ingress by creating a network route to your cluster by executing the command `minikube tunnel`. For documentation on this, see [Using minikube tunnel](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/accessing/#using-minikube-tunnel).
</Aside>

Congratulations! You now have a fully functional Kubernetes environment running FusionAuth.
