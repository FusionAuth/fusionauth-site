## Overview

Having the capability to deploy applications in a local Kubernetes environment allows engineers to quickly develop, test, and demo without the operational overhead of a full-blown cluster. This is precisely what [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs) is designed for by creating a single-node cluster within a virtual machine.

This guide will show you how to install and configure minikube and then install FusionAuth, including the required PostgreSQL database and Elasticsearch, on your minikube cluster.

**Figure 1** shows an example of the minikube configuration that you will create. The cluster will consist of three [Replica Sets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/), one for each deployment of Elasticsearch, Postgresql, and FusionAuth. Each will have one [Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/), with the exception of Elasticsearch which will have three. You could scale it down to one pod, but for simplicity, you will use the default settings for the Elasticsearch chart.
Each deployment exposes a [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) which exposes each application as a network service.
Finally, you will use an [Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/) of type [Load Balancer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/) that allows external traffic, or in this case, traffic from `localhost` to the cluster.

## Requirements

Before you begin, you will need to have the following installed.

* [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - The virtual machine environment you will use to run minikube.
* `helm` - Package manager used for installing and managing Kubernetes applications. In this guide, you will be using a Helm chart to install FusionAuth, a Postgresql database, and Elasticsearch cluster. For more information, see [Installing Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).
* `kubectl` - Command line tool that interacts with the Kubernetes API server and is useful for managing Kubernetes clusters. Before proceeding, follow the installation documentation that corresponds to your platform found [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).

## Install minikube

Navigate to [minikube start](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) and complete step one by selecting the options that apply to your local machine.

For example, if you are running on `macOS` with `x86-64` architecture, Homebrew is a popular <InlineField>installer type</InlineField>:

```shell title="Install minikube"
brew install minikube
```

### Start minikube

Since you will be deploying multiple applications, you will want to start minikube using some additional resource considerations.

<Aside type="caution">
Before proceeding, make sure Docker Desktop has sufficient resources allocated. These settings can be found in Docker Desktop by navigating to *Preferences* and then clicking on *Resources* in the side menu bar. You need to have at least as much memory allocated to Docker Desktop as you give to minikube below.
</Aside>

Start minikube by additionally specifying <InlineField>cpus</InlineField> and <InlineField>memory</InlineField>.

```shell title="Start minikube"
minikube start --cpus 4 --memory 5g
```

<Aside type="note">
This minikube setting is a general recommendation that has been tested for this guide based on resource requirements of FusionAuth, Postgresql, and Elasticsearch.
</Aside>

When the command finishes, it will configure `kubectl` to point to the minikube cluster. You can confirm this by checking the status:

```shell title="Get minikube status"
minikube status

minikube
type: Control Plane
host: Running
kubelet: Running
apiserver: Running
kubeconfig: Configured
```

Or by running the `kubectl` command to view pods running on the cluster. Use the `-A` or `--all-namespaces` to list all pods deployed to the cluster.
Since you have not deployed anything yet, only pods in the `kube-system` namespace will be returned:

```shell title="Get all pods deployed on the cluster"
kubectl get pods -A

NAMESPACE     NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS       AGE
kube-system   coredns-78fcd69978-tr4jt           1/1     Running   0              9m38s
kube-system   etcd-minikube                      1/1     Running   0              9m53s
kube-system   kube-apiserver-minikube            1/1     Running   0              9m51s
kube-system   kube-controller-manager-minikube   1/1     Running   0              9m54s
kube-system   kube-proxy-2h8b2                   1/1     Running   0              9m38s
kube-system   kube-scheduler-minikube            1/1     Running   0              9m51s
kube-system   storage-provisioner                1/1     Running   1 (9m8s ago)   9m50s
```

## Deploy PostgreSQL

Start by adding the bitnami helm repository that contains the Postgresql chart:

```shell title="Add PostgreSQL chart repository"
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
```

To list all of the Helm repositories that you have added, execute this command:

```shell title="List chart repositories"
helm repo list
```

The resulting output will display the chart you just added and any other helm charts that you may have added previously.

```shell title="Output"
NAME      	URL
bitnami   	https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
```

Install the chart using the `helm` command. Set the <InlineField>postgresqlPassword</InlineField> value using the `set` flag for the `postgres` user. In this example, the <InlineField>release</InlineField> field is set to `pg-minikube`:

```shell title="Install the postgresql chart"
helm install pg-minikube --set auth.postgresPassword=<your-postgres-password> bitnami/postgresql
```

Setting the password is optional. A password will be generated automatically if you do not set one.

When completed successfully, the output will contain some useful information about your deployment:

```plaintext title="Output of PostgreSQL creation command"
** Please be patient while the chart is being deployed **

PostgreSQL can be accessed via port 5432 on the following DNS names from within your cluster:

    pg-minikube-postgresql.default.svc.cluster.local - Read/Write connection

To get the password for "postgres" run:

    export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace default pg-minikube-postgresql -o jsonpath="{.data.postgresql-password}" | base64 --decode)

To connect to your database run the following command:

    kubectl run pg-minikube-postgresql-client --rm --tty -i --restart='Never' --namespace default --image docker.io/bitnami/postgresql:11.13.0-debian-10-r40 --env="PGPASSWORD=$POSTGRES_PASSWORD" --command -- psql --host pg-minikube-postgresql -U postgres -d postgres -p 5432

To connect to your database from outside the cluster execute the following commands:

    kubectl port-forward --namespace default svc/pg-minikube-postgresql 5432:5432 &
    PGPASSWORD="$POSTGRES_PASSWORD" psql --host 127.0.0.1 -U postgres -d postgres -p 5432
```

When you deploy FusionAuth, you will need to use the DNS name `pg-minikube-postgresql.default.svc.cluster.local` as seen above and the postgres user password generated or specified during the postgres helm chart installation.

```plaintext title="Export the Postgres password"
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace default pg-minikube-postgresql -o jsonpath="{.data.postgresql-password}" | base64 --decode)
```

If you did not set a password when installing `pg-minikube`, use the command below to display the value of the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variable.

```plaintext title="Display your password"
echo $POSTGRES_PASSWORD
```

You can also test your deployment by attempting to connect to the database.

```plaintext title="Connect to the database"
kubectl run pg-minikube-postgresql-client --rm --tty -i --restart='Never' --namespace default --image docker.io/bitnami/postgresql:11.13.0-debian-10-r40 --env="PGPASSWORD=$POSTGRES_PASSWORD" --command -- psql --host pg-minikube-postgresql -U postgres -d postgres -p 5432
```

You can also verify the `pg-minikube-postgresql` pod by again retrieving pods with `kubectl`. The following command requests pods in the `default` namespace with output (`-o`) containing additional information such as <InlineField>IP Address</InlineField>:

```shell title="Get pods in the default namespace"
kubectl get pods -n default -o wide
```

The resulting output will show `1/1` pg-minikube-postgresql pod in a `READY` state:

```shell title="Output"
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP           NODE       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
pg-minikube-postgresql-0   1/1     Running   0          8m33s   172.17.0.3   minikube   <none>           <none>
```

<PodReady />

You can also retrieve active services on the cluster. A Kubernetes [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) exposes applications running on a pod as a network service. The following command will display the new service exposing the Postgresql application with an IP address running on port `5432`:

```shell title="Get services"
kubectl get services -n default

NAME                              TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
kubernetes                        ClusterIP   10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP    82m
pg-minikube-postgresql            ClusterIP   10.108.174.128   <none>        5432/TCP   27m
pg-minikube-postgresql-headless   ClusterIP   None             <none>        5432/TCP   27m
```

In addition to the `pg-minikube-postgresql` service, you will see another service with the name `kubernetes`. This service is responsible for directing traffic to the Kubernetes API server.

<Aside type="note">
You also might have noticed the additional postgresql service `pg-minikube-postgresql-headless`. This is what is known in Kubernetes as a [Headless Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services). To read more about these types of services, see the official Kubernetes documentation [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services).

## Deploy Elasticsearch

Start by adding the [Elasticsearch Helm Chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/elastic/elasticsearch) repository by running this command:

```shell title="Add Elasticsearch chart repository"
helm repo add elastic https://helm.elastic.co
```

You will now have the two charts that you have added in this guide in addition to any other charts you have added if you have used Helm prior to this guide.

```shell title="List chart repositories"
helm repo list

NAME      	URL
bitnami   	https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
elastic   	https://helm.elastic.co
```

Before installing, you will need to download a copy of a recommended configuration for minikube virtual machines:

```shell title="Download example minikube configuration"
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/Helm-charts/master/elasticsearch/examples/minikube/values.yaml
```

The contents of this configuration uses a smaller JVM heap, smaller memory per pods requests, and smaller persistent volumes.
The `values.yaml` file you downloaded should look like this:

```yaml title="Configuration details"
# Permit co-located instances for solitary minikube virtual machines.
antiAffinity: "soft"

# Shrink default JVM heap.
esJavaOpts: "-Xmx128m -Xms128m"

# Allocate smaller chunks of memory per pod.
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "100m"
    memory: "512M"
  limits:
    cpu: "1000m"
    memory: "512M"

# Request smaller persistent volumes.
volumeClaimTemplate:
  accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
  storageClassName: "standard"
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 100M
```

Now install the Elasticsearch chart using this `values.yaml` configuration by including the `-f` flag:

```shell title="Install elasticsearch chart"
helm install es-minikube elastic/elasticsearch -f values.yaml
```

Be aware, it may take a minute or two for the pods to reach a `READY` state.

Confirm your deployment by retrieving active pods in the cluster.

```shell title="Get pods"
kubectl get pods -n default -o wide
```

The resulting output will show three pods for each elasticsearch node:

```shell title="Output"
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP           NODE       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
elasticsearch-master-0       1/1     Running   0          7m17s   172.17.0.5   minikube   <none>           <none>
elasticsearch-master-1       1/1     Running   0          7m17s   172.17.0.4   minikube   <none>           <none>
elasticsearch-master-2       1/1     Running   0          7m17s   172.17.0.6   minikube   <none>           <none>
pg-minikube-postgresql-0     1/1     Running   0          39m     172.17.0.3   minikube   <none>           <none>
```

Running the `kubectl` command to get service information again will show that the installed Elasticsearch chart exposes the `elasticsearch-master` [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) running at a dedicated IP address on port `9200`:

```shell title="Get services"
kubectl get services -n default

NAME                              TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
elasticsearch-master              ClusterIP   10.107.78.6      <none>        9200/TCP,9300/TCP   3m38s
elasticsearch-master-headless     ClusterIP   None             <none>        9200/TCP,9300/TCP   3m38s
kubernetes                        ClusterIP   10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP             98m
pg-minikube-postgresql            ClusterIP   10.100.117.198   <none>        5432/TCP            92m
pg-minikube-postgresql-headless   ClusterIP   None             <none>        5432/TCP            92m
```

### Kubernetes DNS

The default installation of minikube enables [`kube-dns`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/main/cluster/addons/dns), a [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) that automatically assigns DNS names to other services in the cluster.

When you <ScrollRef target="deploy PostgreSQL" /> and <ScrollRef target="deploy Elasticsearch" />, each service that was created was assigned the following DNS names respectively by `kube-dns`:

* `pg-minikube-postgresql.default.svc.cluster.local`
* `elasticsearch-master.default.svc.cluster.local`

You will use these values for the database and elasticsearch host values when deploying FusionAuth.

For more information on DNS see Kubernetes documentation for [DNS for Services and Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/).

## Next Steps

You now are running all the necessary infrastructure to deploy a containerized application to minikube.

Next up, [Deploy FusionAuth in Kubernetes](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/kubernetes/fusionauth-deployment).
