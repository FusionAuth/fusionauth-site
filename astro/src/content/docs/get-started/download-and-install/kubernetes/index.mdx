The following set of guides are designed to help you get FusionAuth up and running in a Kubernetes cluster as quickly and easily as possible.
Step-by-step instructions are provided on how to setup all of the required infrastructure for your local development machine or favorite cloud provider.

  * [minikube Setup](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/kubernetes/minikube)
  * [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/kubernetes/eks)
  * [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/kubernetes/gke)
  * [Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/kubernetes/aks)

Each setup guide provides instructions on provisioning a Kubernetes cluster specific to the provider. Since FusionAuth requires a database, instructions on creating a managed PostgreSQL database are also included. For required version information, please review the [general FusionAuth System requirements](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/system-requirements).

If you already have your Kubernetes platform setup, the [Deploy FusionAuth to Kubernetes](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/kubernetes/fusionauth-deployment) guide demonstrates how to configure and deploy FusionAuth to your cluster.

<Aside type="note">
While databases can be deployed in Kubernetes using [Stateful Sets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/), using managed services such as [Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) or [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql) are the preferred option as maintenance tasks like scaling, backups, and patching are handled for you.
</Aside>

Instructions are also provided in each guide on how to setup Elasticsearch. Using Elasticsearch is optional and can be configured accordingly prior to deploying FusionAuth.

## Istio

Community provided [Istio configurations can be found here](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-contrib/tree/main/kubernetes/istio).

Here's a sample, community contributed, Istio configuration file.
