If you receive a message similar to this one in your system log:

```
ERROR io.fusionauth.api.service.system.NodeService - Node [c98263dc-7f12-4879-93c1-f1a634912a51] cannot be added. The runtime mode is [Development] and this node in [Production] mode.
```

This means that your nodes are in different runtime modes. This will not work and may cause undetermined behavior. All nodes of a FusionAuth cluster must be running in the same mode, either `Production` or `Development`.

To resolve this issue, take the following steps:

* Stop all existing nodes, whether they are running as containers or processes. 
* Review configuration to confirm that all nodes are configured with the same runtime mode.
* Restart the nodes.
