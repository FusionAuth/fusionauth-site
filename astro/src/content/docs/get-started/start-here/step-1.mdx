This doc will explain how to install FusionAuth.

## Install FusionAuth

First, you'll need to install FusionAuth locally. You could also sign-up for a free FusionAuth Cloud trial, but running FusionAuth locally is simple (and anonymous).

Plus, you'll likely want to run FusionAuth locally during development, in your staging environment, and probably in your CI/CD pipeline as well. Learning to install FusionAuth now is a great place to start.

## Open the web UI

Open a browser to http://localhost:9011 and you'll be presented with the FusionAuth login page. The installation instructions above used Kickstart (LINK NEEDED), which created an admin user:

* Login id: **admin@example.com**
* Password: **password**

Go ahead and log into the FusionAuth admin UI now.
