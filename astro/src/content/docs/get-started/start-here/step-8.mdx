## Congrats!

You've completed your first steps to becoming a FusionAuth master. Even if Typescript, Node, and Express aren't your preferred languages or frameworks, you should have a decent understanding of how applications integrate with FusionAuth to provide authentication and authorization.

To continue your learning journey, this Getting Started section of the docs contain a ton of great resources.
