FusionAuth is downloadable software, so you need to run it somewhere. 

There are many options.

* Download FusionAuth and run it on your own laptop, using [Docker and Docker Compose](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/docker) to avoid installing a database.
* Download FusionAuth as a [ZIP, DEB or RPM](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/fusionauth-app) if you have a database installed and want to use it. 
  * This option requires proceeding through maintenance mode where you'll configure a connection to a database.
* Use [GitPod to run it in the cloud](TODO) in your GitPod account.
* [Spin up a free trial instance in FusionAuth Cloud](TODOexpressfreetrial) if you don't want to install anything locally.
* [Use our public sandbox account](https://sandbox.fusionauth.io) if you want to look around the admin UI and integrate with a free, public cloud instance.
  * Did we mention this was PUBLIC?

After all of these, you'll have to step through [Setup Wizard](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/setup-wizard) to configure your first user. You'll also be prompted to set up your first application in the admin UI, which corresponds to your mobile or web application. TODO
