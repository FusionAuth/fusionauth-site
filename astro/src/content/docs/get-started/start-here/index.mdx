To get started with FusionAuth, you need to do three tasks:

* Launch FusionAuth
* Delegate authentication
* Add functionality to your application

Here's a diagram of this process.

<StartDiagram alt="Launch, then delegate, then add functionality" />

Let's walk through an example.

## Prerequisites

* git
* Docker (if you want to follow the Docker instructions)

## Launch FusionAuth

FusionAuth is downloadable software, so you need to run it somewhere. For this guide, you can either

* Use Docker to install and run FusionAuth and the application
* Use GitPod to run FusionAuth in the cloud in your GitPod account, with no software install needed.

### Docker

<DockerComposeFiles />

TODO need to have this take a kickstart from the tutorial app.

### GitPod

TODO

### What Did You Just Do?

You launched a standalone authentication server and configured it. You set up a user with the email address `admin@example.com` and the password `password`, which you will use in the next step.

## Delegate Authentication

Next, you need to update an application to delegate authentication to FusionAuth. This guide will use a simple nodejs application, but any language that supports OIDC or REST APIs will work. You can view working examples in over 20 languages in our [quickstarts](/docs/quickstarts).

TODO maybe use nodejs quickstart as a base https://fusionauth.io/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-javascript-express-web

### Docker

minimum to do here is:

* disable normal login (which goes against in memory database)
* update login button to point to fusionauth


### GitPod

### What Did You Just Do?

You updated a JavaScript application and changed it from authenticating locally to using FusionAuth.

## Add Functionality

By delegating authentication to FusionAuth, your application gets access to authentication and authorization functionality, such as multi-factor authentication, social sign-on, self-service registration and more.

Enabling your users to log in with a different identity store is can reduce friction and user frustration. Let's enable:

* Login with Google
* Login with SAML

You can choose to do one or both of these.

### Login With Google

TODO set up sample google project

### Login With SAML

login against sandbox

Is there anything else that would be cool to show here?

### What Did You Just Do?

You enabled login functionality which your application can benefit from without touching a single line of code.

## Next Steps

You can dig deeper into options for:

* [launching FusionAuth](/docs/get-started/start-here/launch)
* [options for delegating](/docs/get-started/start-here/delegate) 
* [adding functionality](/docs/get-started/start-here/add)

## Quickstarts

Looking for something quicker?

Quickstarts walk you through the Launch and Delegate steps, leaving you with a running application in your framework or language of choice, to which you can add functionality.

If you have Docker installed and one of over 20 frameworks and languages, you can run through [our quickstarts](/docs/quickstarts).

Each quickstart includes a complete runnable application and a shell application you can build out by following the step-by-step integration instructions.
