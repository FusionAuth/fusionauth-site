To get started with FusionAuth, you need to do three things:

* Launch FusionAuth
* Delegate authentication
* Add functionality to your application

<StartDiagram alt="Launch, then delegate, then add functionality." />

Let's walk through an example where you'll add a Login With Google button to an application with no code changes required.

## Prerequisites

* git
* Docker (if you want to follow the Docker instructions)

## Launch FusionAuth

FusionAuth is downloadable software, so you need to run it somewhere. For this guide, you can either

* Use Docker to install and run FusionAuth and the application
* Use GitPod to run FusionAuth in the cloud in your GitPod account, with no software install needed.

### Docker

TODO

* start docker

### GitPod

TODO

* start gitpod

### Common Tasks

* have the user log in to the admin screen
* set up a new user
* register them for the application
* have the user log out

### What Did You Just Do?

You launched a standalone authentication server and configured it. You set up a user with the email address `admin@example.com` and the password `password`, which you will use in the next step.

## Delegate Authentication

Next, you need to update an application to delegate authentication to FusionAuth. This guide will use a simple nodejs application.

TODO maybe use nodejs quickstart as a base https://fusionauth.io/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-javascript-express-web


minimum to do here is:

* start the application (do those instructions differ between gitpod and docker? maybe)
* show relevant sections for creating authorization url and exchanging tokens.
* have the user log in with a known user (maybe the same user as for the admin screen)

### What Did You Just Do?

You started a JavaScript application, examined some code, and logged in to the application using FusionAuth.

## Add Functionality

By delegating to FusionAuth, your application gets access to authentication and authorization functionality, such as magic link login, multi-factor authentication, social sign-on, self-service registration and more. This is where a lot of the value comes from.

Enabling your users to log in using magic links can reduce friction and user frustration. Let's enable this on the application you just set up.

### Login With Magic Links

To add a `Login With Magic Links` button, you usually have to configure an email server and then FusionAuth. But for this guide, we've already set up the email server. It is a locally running mock email server, and you can visit your inbox at [http://localhost:1080](http://localhost:1080).

<Aside type="note">
Typically you'd need to configure an email server and the email template, but this has been done for you in the setup steps above.
</Aside>

Log out of your application and log in to the [Admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin).

Navigate to <Breadcrumb>Applications</Breadcrumb> and then edit the ChangeBank application. Navigate to the <Breadcrumb>Security</Breadcrumb> tab and then the <Breadcrumb>Passwordless login</Breadcrumb> section.

Click the <InlineField>Enable</InlineField> toggle.

Click the blue 'save' button to save your configuration change.

![Save the application.](/img/docs/get-started/start-here/save-application.png)

Now, log out of the admin UI.

[Visit your application](http://localhost:8080/) and click the <InlineUIElement>Login</InlineUIElement> button.

Scroll down if needed. You'll see a 'Login With Magic Link' button (TODO might not be that text).

![Login screen with magic link enabled.](/img/docs/get-started/start-here/login-screen-magic-link-enabled.png)

Click on it and enter your user's email address (`richard@example.com` in the screenshot below) and click <InlineUIElement>Send</InlineUIElement>

![After entering users email address.](/img/docs/get-started/start-here/login-screen-magic-link-enter-email.png)

Now you can visit the [email inbox](http://localhost:1080) and you'll see your magic link email. 

![Email inbox with magic link message.](/img/docs/get-started/start-here/email-inbox-magic-link-message.png)

Click on the link, and you'll be logged into your application.

### What Did You Just Do?

You enabled Magic Link login for your application without touching a single line of code.

Congrats!

Let's talk about next steps.

## Quickstarts

Looking for an example in a particular language? Quickstarts walk you through the Launch and Delegate steps, leaving you with a running application in your framework or language of choice, to which you can add functionality.

If you have Docker installed and one of over 20 frameworks and languages, you can run through [our quickstarts](/docs/quickstarts).

Each quickstart includes a complete runnable application and a shell application you can build out by following the step-by-step integration instructions.

## Next Steps

* Learn more about [other identity providers, including SAML, OIDC and Facebook](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/identity-providers/).
* Learn about [passwordless options including magic links and passkeys](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/passwordless/).
* Enable [self-service registration](/docs/lifecycle/register-users/basic-registration-forms) to let users sign up for your application.
* Enable [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/multi-factor-authentication). TOTP MFA is free, but other MFA methods require a paid license.
* Sign up for a [trial FusionAuth Cloud instance](https://account.fusionauth.io/account/free-trial/start) which comes with a free Starter plan to explore [other paid features](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/premium-features).
