Do you care about authentication, authorization and user management?

Sure, you know your application needs it, but do you really want to spend time building undifferentiated functionality like social login, multi-factor authentication, or password reset? By using FusionAuth for authentication, authorization and user management, you get these benefits:

* **pre-built authentication workflows** and integrations accelerate application delivery
* **secure storage of user credentials and profile data**, wherever you want (you host or we host)
* **new functionality and bugfixes** from the security experts on the FusionAuth team, available to your users when you upgrade
* **the same experience** and application whether you develop locally, use FusionAuth in your CI/CD system, or run it in prod
* fine grained control of the version of FusionAuth you use; **upgrades happen on your schedule, not ours**

This guide will walk you through standing up a sample, pre-configured application that uses FusionAuth for login.

You'll also add the ability to log a user in using an emailed magic link.

## Overview of Using FusionAuth

To get started with FusionAuth, you need to do three things:

* Launch FusionAuth
* Delegate authentication
* Add functionality to your application (optional, but common)

<StartDiagram alt="Launch, then delegate, then add functionality." />

Let's walk through an example where you'll add `Login With a Magic Link` functionality to an application, with no code changes required.

## Prerequisites

* `git`
* a web browser
* either:
  * Docker (if you follow the Docker instructions) or 
  * a GitHub account (if you follow the GitPod instructions)
* `node` (this was tested with `v20.16.0`, but should work with any node version)

---

## Launch FusionAuth

FusionAuth is downloadable software; you can run it locally, on your cloud VM, in a container, or on FusionAuth Cloud.

For this guide, you can either:

* Use Docker to install and run FusionAuth and the application
* Use GitPod to run FusionAuth in the cloud in your GitPod account--no software install required

Expand the section you want to follow and get started.

### Install and Run in Docker
<details>
<summary>Docker</summary>
<DockerInstallAndStart codeRoot={frontmatter.codeRoot} kickstartUri={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"}/>
</details>

### Install and Run in GitPod
<details>
<summary>GitPod</summary>
<GitPodStart codeRoot={frontmatter.codeRoot} kickstartUri={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/kickstart/kickstart.json"}/>

</details>

### What Did You Just Do?

You launched a FusionAuth instance with either Docker or GitPod. It was prepopulated with application and user data.

## Delegate Authentication

Once you have FusionAuth up and running, you need to set up your application or applications to delegate to FusionAuth. For this guide, there's an example `Start Here` application which is already set up to do so. Let's look at that configuration and then start the application up so you can log in. Below is a diagram showing this flow.

<AfterDelegateDiagram />

### Navigate To The Application Configuration In The FusionAuth Admin UI

* In the previous step, you logged in to the system as an admin user. Go back to that browser screen, which should be showing the administrative interface for FusionAuth.
* Navigate to <Breadcrumb>Applications</Breadcrumb> in the left-hand sidebar. You may need to use the hamburger icon at the top left of the screen to see all options.
* Choose the `Start Here` application.
* Choose <InlineUIElement>Edit</InlineUIElement> from the <InlineUIElement>Actions</InlineUIElement> dropdown.

### Review The Application Configuration

After the user signs in using FusionAuth, they need to get back to your application. You configure each FusionAuth application configuration with URLs to send the user back to.

In the application configuration you are looking at, you can review the pre-configured authorized redirect URLs.

![The edit screen of the application.](/img/docs/get-started/start-here/edit-application.png)

You can also see other useful information, such as the `Client Id`, which tells FusionAuth which application configuration to use.

There are many other settings, but they are not important for this guide, so you can leave them all alone.

Click the logout button on the admin UI to log out from the admin user account.

### Review How Application Delegation Works

To understand how the JavaScript application delegates to FusionAuth, take a quick look at some of the Node.JS application code from the GitHub repository. You can either open it up in an editor or follow along here.

To send the user over to FusionAuth initially, you must craft a URL that includes the `Client Id` from the configuration you reviewed above, as well as other parameters needed to offer a secure authentication experience. Here's the code that does that.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-example-express-start-here/main/app/src/index.ts" lang="javascript" tags="login" />

Once the user authenticates, the code at the redirect URL is called.

This code sends parameters from the login event (the authorization code, here stored in the `authCode` variable), the client identifier (stored in the `clientId` variable) and other parameters, to FusionAuth. FusionAuth examines these parameters and, if they all are correct, sends a token to the Node.JS application. When the app receives these, **the user is authenticated**. The application can then let the user access data or functionality.

You can also retrieve additional user details. This code does that, and stores the value in the `userResponse` variable.

Here's the code that both completes the authentication and makes the request for additional user details.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-example-express-start-here/main/app/src/index.ts" lang="javascript" tags="oauth-redirect" />

Once you have the token and other data, what should the app do? One great option is to store it as a `Secure`, `HTTPOnly` cookie. The above code does this using the `res.cookie` function.

<Aside type="note">
Why is the `accessToken` stored as a `HTTPOnly` cookie, when the `userResponse` data is stored as a normal cookie? Access tokens can be used to protect resources and access data. The user data is used for the user interface, such as to show the email address of the user.

In the former case, you want to disallow the token from being read by JavaScript, to avoid XSS attacks. In the latter case, you might need to let a cookie be read by JavaScript to build the proper UI.
</Aside>

We now can protect app functionality. For the account page, which requires authorization, the user's identity is checked and the browser is redirected to the main page if there is no valid token.

<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-example-express-start-here/main/app/src/index.ts" lang="javascript" tags="account" />

You can check out how all the code and templates fit together in the `app` directory.

### Start Up And Log In To The Application

<Aside type="caution">
Did you remember to log out of the admin UI? To check, try to access the admin UI by doing the following, depending on whether you are using Docker or GitPod:

<AdminAccessInstructions />

In either case, if you are prompted to log in, you are good. Otherwise, log out.
</Aside>

In your shell, type the following to start up the application:

<Code code="cd app && npm install && npm run dev" />

Next, navigate to the application.

<AppAccessInstructions />

Then, log in to the Node.JS application in the browser:

* Click on the <InlineUIElement>Login</InlineUIElement> button in the upper right hand corner.
* Authenticate using the email `richard@example.com` and the password `password`.

You'll then be logged to the application.

### What Did You Just Do?

High five! In this section, you:

* looked at some FusionAuth configuration
* reviewed some Node.JS application code relevant to the integration
* started the application
* logged in to the `Start Here` application using FusionAuth

## Add Functionality

By delegating authentication to FusionAuth, your application gets access to all kinds of authentication and authorization functionality, such as magic link login, multi-factor authentication (MFA), social sign-on, self-service registration and more. Getting these flows out of the box is a lot of the value of using FusionAuth.

Let's add one piece of functionality to complete this tutorial. Let's allow users to log in using magic links, where they get a link emailed to their inbox and can click on it to log in. Offering this login method reduces sign-in friction and user frustration. 

In this section, you'll modify the FusionAuth configuration to offer users the option to log into the `Start Here` application via a magic link.

### The Email Server

To add a `Login With Magic Links` button, you usually have to configure an email server and then the email templates that are sent. Never fear, for this guide, we've already set up the email server and configured the templates.

The email server is a locally running mock email server, and you can visit the inbox:

<MailAccessInstructions />

### Enable Magic Links In FusionAuth

Log out of your application and log in to the Admin UI. To get to the admin UI, do the following:

<AdminAccessInstructions />

Navigate to <Breadcrumb>Applications</Breadcrumb> and then edit the `Start Here` application. Navigate to the <Breadcrumb>Security</Breadcrumb> tab and then the <Breadcrumb>Passwordless login</Breadcrumb> section.

Click the <InlineField>Enable</InlineField> toggle.

![Enable the magic link login.](/img/docs/get-started/start-here/enable-magic-link-login.png)

Click the blue 'save' button to save your configuration change.

![Save the application.](/img/docs/get-started/start-here/save-application.png)

Now, log out of the admin UI.

### Get A Magic Link And Log In

Visit your application.  To get to the application:

<AppAccessInstructions />

Click the <InlineUIElement>Login</InlineUIElement> button.

Scroll down, if needed. You'll see a <InlineUIElement>Login with a magic link</InlineUIElement> button.

![Login screen with magic link enabled.](/img/docs/get-started/start-here/login-screen-magic-link-enabled.png)

Click on it and enter your user's email address (`richard@example.com`) and click <InlineUIElement>Send</InlineUIElement>

![After entering users email address.](/img/docs/get-started/start-here/login-screen-magic-link-enter-email.png)

Now you can visit your email inbox and you'll see your magic link email. 

<MailAccessInstructions />

You should see something similar to:

![Email inbox with magic link message.](/img/docs/get-started/start-here/email-inbox-magic-link-message.png)

Click on the link, and you'll be logged into your application.

### What Did You Just Do?

You enabled Magic Link login for your application without touching a single line of code.

## Summing Up

Congrats! You are all done with this tutorial.

In this tutorial, you've done the following:

* Started up your own FusionAuth instance using either Docker or GitPod.
* Examined code and configuration and started an example application.
* Extended the example application to allow login with an emailed link without writing any code.

Let's talk about next steps.

## Quickstarts

Looking for an example in a particular language? Quickstarts walk you through the Launch and Delegate steps, leaving you with a running application in your framework or language of choice, to which you can add functionality. If you have Docker installed and one of over 20 frameworks and languages, [check out our quickstarts](/docs/quickstarts).

Each quickstart includes a complete runnable application and a shell application you can build out by following the step-by-step integration instructions.

## More Functionality
