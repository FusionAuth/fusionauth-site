To get started with FusionAuth, you need to do three tasks:

* Launch FusionAuth
* Delegate authentication
* Add functionality to your application

Here's a diagram of this process.

<StartDiagram alt="Launch, then delegate, then add functionality" />

Let's dig into each of these a bit more.

## Launch FusionAuth

FusionAuth is downloadable software, so you need to run it somewhere. 

There are many options.

* Download FusionAuth and run it on your own laptop, using [Docker and Docker Compose](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/docker) to avoid installing a database.
* Download FusionAuth as a [ZIP, DEB or RPM](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/fusionauth-app) if you have a database installed and want to use it. This will require proceeding through maintenance mode.
* Use [GitPod to run it in the cloud](TODO) in your GitPod account.
* [Spin up free trial instance in FusionAuth Cloud](TODOexpressfreetrial) if you don't want to install anything locally.

After all of these, you'll have to step through [Setup Wizard](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/setup-wizard) to configure your first user. You'll also be prompted to set up your first application in the admin UI, which corresponds to your mobile or web application.

## Delegate Authentication

Next, you need to update your application to delegate authentication to FusionAuth. Again, you have a few options:

* Most frameworks have an OIDC library. If you are familiar with one, you can use it, since FusionAuth supports OIDC. Here's a [curated list of OIDC libraries](https://oauth.net/code/).
* FusionAuth provides SDKs for the most common JavaScript frameworks: [Angular](/docs/sdks/angular-sdk), [React](/docs/sdks/react-sdk), and [Vue](/docs/sdks/vue-sdk).
* FusionAuth provides mobile SDKs: [Android](/docs/sdks/android-sdk). iOS support is coming soon, but you can use [iOS AppAuth](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS) until then.
* Client library TODO do we want to build this out

## Add Functionality

This is where the fun is! Your application now gets access to all kinds of authentication based functionality. By using FusionAuth for your authentication solution, you get access to all of these workflows:

How you enable functionality depends on what you are looking for. Here is a list of common functionality you might want to enable or customize.

* [Login with Google](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/identity-providers/social/google)
* [Login with SAML](docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/identity-providers/overview-samlv2)
* [Multi-factor authentication](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/multi-factor-authentication)
* [Email verification](TODO)
* [Magic links](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/passwordless/magic-links)
* [Set up self-service registration](/docs/lifecycle/register-users/basic-registration-forms)
* [Customize the login and other pages](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/)
* [Customize emails](/docs/customize/email-and-messages/)
* [Log users out](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/logout-session-management)

## Quickstarts

Looking for something quicker?

Quickstarts take you through the Launch and Delegate steps, leaving you with a running application in your framework or language of choice to which you can add functionality.

If you have Docker installed and one of over 20 frameworks and languages, you can run through [our quickstarts](/docs/quickstarts).

Each quickstart includes a complete runnable application and a shell application you can build out by following the step-by-step integration instructions.
