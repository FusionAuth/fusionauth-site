Next, you need to update your application to delegate authentication to FusionAuth. 

You have a few options:

* Most frameworks have an OIDC library. If you are familiar with one, you can use it, since FusionAuth supports OIDC. Here's a [curated list of OIDC libraries](https://oauth.net/code/).
* FusionAuth provides SDKs for the most common JavaScript frameworks: [Angular](/docs/sdks/angular-sdk), [React](/docs/sdks/react-sdk), and [Vue](/docs/sdks/vue-sdk).
* FusionAuth provides mobile SDKs: [Android](/docs/sdks/android-sdk). iOS support is coming soon, but you can use [iOS AppAuth](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS) until then.
* Client library TODO do we want to build this out
