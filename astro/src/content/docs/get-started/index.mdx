## Introduction

FusionAuth is a modern platform for Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM). FusionAuth provides APIs and a responsive web user interface to support
login, registration, localized email, multi-factor authentication, reporting and much more.

If you're looking for employee login or a replacement for Active Directory, you may be in the wrong place. While FusionAuth can be used for nearly any application, we do not offer native desktop integration and replacing Active Directory is not on our roadmap.

However, if you're looking for a solution to manage end users that can perform at scale, then keep reading.

Here's a typical application login flow before FusionAuth.

<LoginBefore alt="Login before FusionAuth" />

And here's the same application login flow when FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginAfter alt="Login after FusionAuth" />
