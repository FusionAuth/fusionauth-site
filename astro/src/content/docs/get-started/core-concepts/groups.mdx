## Overview

There are a few reasons you may want to use a FusionAuth Group.

The first use may be to simply logically group one or more users within a Tenant. Once a User is a member of a Group they may be identified as a member of the Group and retrieved using the [User Search API](/docs/apis/users#search-for-users) and the Elasticsearch search engine.

The second reason you may wish to use a FusionAuth group is to manage Application Role assignment. A Group may be assigned roles from one or more Applications, a member of this Group will be dynamically assigned these roles if they have a registration for the Application.

## Core Concepts Relationships

Below is a visual reminder of the relationships between FusionAuth's primary core concepts.

### Examples

You could create a Group called `Admin`, and assign this group the admin role from each of your applications.

A more detailed example: 

Suppose Application A has two roles: `admin` and `member`. Application B has one role `superadmin`.

User 1 has a registration in Application A and user 2 has a registration in Application B.

There's a group `Admin Group` which has the application roles of `admin` from Application A and `superadmin` from application B.  

If you add User 1 to `Admin group` they will receive the role `admin` in Application A, but not `superadmin` (because they aren't registered in Application B).  

## Admin UI

### Create a Group

Click on <strong>Settings -> Groups</strong> from the main menu to add a Group. At a minimum, you must provide a <InlineField>Name</InlineField> for the Group and the <InlineField>Tenant</InlineField> it belongs to.

You may apply Application roles from the various Applications in this Group's Tenant.
