The main limits on tenants in FusionAuth are resources of the underlying server. The tenants are lightweight, but do take some resources. There are multiple production FusionAuth instances supporting in the neighborhood of ten thousand tenants, and instances have been tested with tens of thousands of them.

The default FusionAuth tenant, in which the FusionAuth administrative user interface application resides, cannot be removed.

Another current limitation of FusionAuth with respect to tenants is the ability to limit users who log into the administrative user interface to a single tenant. This is not currently supported directly; the current recommendation is to use the [SDKs](/docs/sdks) to integrate user management functionality directly into your application. There are tracking issues for this functionality. Both [GitHub issue #91](https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-issues/issues/91) and [GitHub issue #1524](https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1524) offer different ways to add support for this feature.

Login records, audit logs and other log files are not separated by tenant. You may be able to query based on FusionAuth tenant or application Ids, but if you need true isolation of log files, you should run separate instances. There's a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/922) to address this.

CORS settings are not configurable by tenant, nor are other settings configured by navigating to <Breadcrumb>Settings -> System</Breadcrumb>.

FusionAuth application objects and other FusionAuth tenant scoped entities cannot be shared across tenants. If you need to keep such entities in sync, you can write scripts to sync up the configuration of multiple FusionAuth applications across tenants.
