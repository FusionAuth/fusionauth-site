If you have admin users, such as customer support representatives, which need cross-tenant access, you can't keep their accounts in sync.
You can either:

* Force such users to reset their password.
* Use a passwordless login option.
* Set up or use an administrative identity server, such as a second instance of FusionAuth, Google GSuite, or Azure AD/Microsoft Entra.
* Put all admin users in one FusionAuth tenant, create an application in that tenant, and set up an OIDC Identity Provider for applications in other tenants to delgate to that application.
