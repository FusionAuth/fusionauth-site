If you have admin users, such as customer support representatives, which need cross-tenant access, you can't keep their accounts in sync.
You can either:

* Force such users to reset their password.
* Use a passwordless login option.
* Set up or use an administrative identity server, such as a second instance of FusionAuth, Google GSuite, or Azure AD/Microsoft Entra.
