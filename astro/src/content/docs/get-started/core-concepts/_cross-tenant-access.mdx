If you have admin users which need cross-tenant access, it can be a challenge to keep their accounts in sync. You can use the API to sync up profile attributes, but some user fields like passwords cannot be retrieved via the API. This can be a challenge for cross-tenant admin users like customer support representatives.

In this situation, you can:

* Have users reset their password every time they need access to a different tenant.
* Use a passwordless login option like a magic link or passkey.
* Set up or use an administrative identity server, such as a second instance of FusionAuth, Google GSuite, or Azure AD/Microsoft Entra, and have these users log in using that.
* Put all admin users in one FusionAuth tenant, create an application in that tenant, and set up an OIDC Identity Provider for applications in other tenants to delegate to that application.
