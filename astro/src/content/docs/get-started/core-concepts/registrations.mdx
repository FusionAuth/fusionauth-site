## Overview

Registrations in FusionAuth are the link between [Users](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/users) and [Applications](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/applications).

A User can have zero or more registrations. Each registration can have zero or more [roles](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/roles) associated with it. 


The [registrations API](/docs/apis/registrations) documents the allowed attributes of a User registration.

If a User exists in a [tenant](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/roles) and attempts to authenticate against an [Application](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/applications), but are not registered, the [authentication will succeed but they will not be authorized](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/authentication-authorization).

## Core Concepts Relationships

Below is a visual reminder of the relationships between FusionAuth's primary core concepts.
