<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Refresh token duration" required defaults="43,200">
    The length of time the refresh token is valid. Refresh tokens are typically long lived.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Refresh token expiration" optional defaults="Fixed">
    The <InlineField>Refresh token expiration</InlineField> may be either a fixed window, sliding window, or sliding window with a maximum lifetime. By default, the expiration of a refresh token is a fixed length of time from when it was originally issued. With a sliding window expiration, the expiration is calculated from the last time the refresh token was used. However with a sliding window with a maximum lifetime, the expiration is calculated from the last time the refresh token was used until a maximum lifetime value is reached.

    For instance, consider the following scenarios given the above configuration. If a refresh token is issued at 1:00pm and has a duration of 60 minutes, if the expiration is fixed, the token will expire at 2:00pm. If, instead, the expiration is a sliding window, then if the refresh token is used at 1:55pm, it would then expire at 2:55pm. If it were then used at 2:50pm, it would expire at 3:50 pm. Lastly if the expiration is a sliding window with a maximum lifetime of 24 hours, then the token could be refreshed every hour (in the same sliding manner as outlined above) up to 23 times. For instance, if a token was issued at 1:55pm on Monday and refreshed every hour, the 23th refresh it would be the last valid refresh request (12:55pm Tuesday would be the last valid refresh event).
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Refresh token usage" optional defaults="Reusable">
    The <InlineField>Refresh token usage</InlineField> may be reusable or one time use. By default, a token is reusable and the token does not change after it was issued. With a one time use token, the token value will be changed each time the token is used to refresh a JWT. This means the client must store the new value after each use.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Refresh token revocation" optional renderif={props.page === "tenant"}>
    The event or events that will cause refresh tokens to be revoked.
  </APIField>
