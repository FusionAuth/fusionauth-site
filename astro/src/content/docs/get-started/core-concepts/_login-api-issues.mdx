You can use the [Login API](/docs/apis/login) to sign in your users directly. In this case, you will likely use one of the [FusionAuth client libraries](/docs/sdks/index).

When a user signs in with this API, you receive the entire user object, as well as the JWT.

When you build on top of the Login API, you're responsible for building the user interface for all login use cases. This gives you more control, as well. You can still use other FusionAuth provided user interfaces for use cases such as the forgot password flow.

Using the Login API means that since your application will see sensitive user credentials, you'll need to ensure the application secures such data appropriately. This is in contrast with the OAuth grants, where only the identity provider has access to the credentials, and your application only sees tokens.
