An Application's OAuth configuration allows you to specify the logout behavior of an application as either "All applications" or "Redirect only."
Specifying the default value of "All applications" will call the configured logout URL for each application in the Tenant _except_ for the FusionAuth admin application.

As of version 1.37.0, this is no longer a limitation. See [the release notes for version 1.37.0](/docs/release-notes/#version-1-37-0) for more information.
