## Overview

<LicensingPremiumFeaturesIntro />

You can see a list of features on the [plans and features page](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/plans-features).

Here's a brief video documenting how to find and add your license to your instance if you have a paid plan.

<YouTube id="ss2U5VKo42M" />

The video covers the same content as the [Adding Your License to Your Instance](#adding-your-license-to-your-instance) section.

## Adding Your License to Your Instance

To access paid features, purchase a license via the [pricing page](/pricing) or by [contacting the sales team](/contact).

Once a license is purchased you must activate it.
To do so, log into your [Account](https://account.fusionauth.io/account).
Navigate to the <Breadcrumb>Plan</Breadcrumb> tab.

![View the plan tab.](/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/plan-tab.png)

Copy the license Id appropriate for your needs.

Use the "Production" license Id for your production server.
This will be used to calculate your monthly active users (MAU), which may affect your monthly bill.
[Learn more about MAU here](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/users#what-makes-a-user-active).
The other license Id is suitable for non-production environments, such as user acceptance testing or development.

<Aside type="note">
  You can always find your license Id by logging in to your [Account](https://account.fusionauth.io/account) and then navigating to the <Breadcrumb>Plan</Breadcrumb> tab. If you do not have a license Id there, you are on the Community plan. In that case, no license is required.
</Aside>

After you have your license Id, log in to your FusionAuth instance.

The credentials you use to log into the instance have no connection to the credentials you used to log into your account portal.
Navigate to the <Breadcrumb>Reactor</Breadcrumb> tab and enter your license Id in the <InlineField>License key</InlineField> field.

<Aside type="note">
You will need either the `admin` or `reactor_manager` roles in the FusionAuth application to view the <Breadcrumb>Reactor</Breadcrumb> tab.
</Aside>

![Activate Reactor.](/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/reactor-activate.png)

In an air-gapped configuration where outbound network access is not allowed, the license text is available in your [Account Portal in the <Breadcrumb>Plan</Breadcrumb> tab](https://account.fusionauth.io/account/plan). See the [air-gapping documentation](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/air-gapping) for more on how to use the license text.

Immediately after activating, FusionAuth must obtain a secure connection to FusionAuth's servers. 
It may take a minute or two to complete activation.

Once that has happened, the <InlineField>Licensed</InlineField> field will change to a green checkmark.
This may require a page refresh.
You will also see a list of premium features.
Depending on your particular plan, some may not be active.
You can see a list of features on the [premium features page](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/premium-features).

## Regenerating Your License

You may want to regenerate your license for any number of reasons.

* It may be part of a regular secrets rotation system.
* You may have inadvertently exposed your license key.

You can do so using the [Reactor API](/docs/apis/reactor).

But you can also regenerate the license via the <Breadcrumb>Plan</Breadcrumb> tab.
To do so, log into your [Account](https://account.fusionauth.io/account). Then navigate to the <Breadcrumb>Plan</Breadcrumb> tab. Then click the <InlineUIElement>Action</InlineUIElement> button to display the dropdown.

![The license action dropdown.](/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/license-action-dropdown.png)

After you choose which license to regenerate, you'll be prompted to confirm your choice.

## Deactivating Your License

<DeactivateLicense />

## The License API

You can use the [Reactor API](/docs/apis/reactor) to activate or deactivate your license. 

You can also retrieve data on the license status of your instance, including whether specific features are enabled or disabled.

## Licensing and Kickstart

You can set your license Id using Kickstart as well.
Doing so allows you to use features requiring a license in your development environment and continuous integration systems.
You should use the non-production license Id in your Kickstart files.

<KickstartLicenseText />

Learn more about [setting up Kickstart](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/kickstart).

## Advanced Scenarios

You may configure FusionAuth to use an HTTP proxy for any outbound connections. This is done using the `proxy.*` configuration settings, [documented here](/docs/reference/configuration). When a proxy is configured, FusionAuth will use it for all outbound HTTP connections, including the data downloads for premium features mentioned above. Using a proxy in this manner allows FusionAuth to access external data through a connection of your choosing. 

You can run FusionAuth with limited or no network access by using an [air-gapped license](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/air-gapping). Please [contact sales](/contact) for more information.

## Common Questions

**Which license do I use?**

There are two licenses, a production license and a non-production one. Use the production license on any system where real live users login. This will be tracked for purposes of MAU calculations, and will affect your monthly bill.

Non-production licenses are used for any other purpose: development, UAT, testing, CI/CD, etc. Any logins which occur on an instance with such a license will not be part of the MAU count.

**What counts as an active user?**

Any user who logs in during the time period. It doesn't matter if they log in once or one thousand times. [Learn more about what counts as a login here](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/users#what-makes-a-user-active).

Other questions about licensing, MAU overages and certifications can be found in [the License FAQ](/license-faq).
