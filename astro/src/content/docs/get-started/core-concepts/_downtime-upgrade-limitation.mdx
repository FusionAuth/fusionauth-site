System upgrades require downtime.
This is typically on the order of seconds to minutes.

In general, the process for upgrading from version `1.x-1` to version `1.x` is:

* Take down all nodes running `1.x-1`.
* Upgrade the database schema by running the migrations, bringing the database to version `1.x`.
* Upgrade the FusionAuth application and (if required) Elasticsearch packages, bringing your nodes to `1.x`.
* Start all FusionAuth nodes.

The recommendation is that you automate the process and minimize downtime.
For FusionAuth Cloud we use a configuration management tool and see downtime on the order of seconds for multi-node instances.

You may also, if you are in an environment with a load balancer and creating nodes is easy, follow this process:

* Stand up a node and install FusionAuth `1.x` on it.
* Replace a node running `1.x-1` out of the load balancer with the new node running `1.x`.
* Upgrade the database schema by running the migrations, bringing the database to version `1.x`. If you are running in `production` and `silent` mode, FusionAuth will apply the changes, otherwise you must apply them out of band (by running the SQL scripts). Read more about [silent mode](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/silent-mode/).
* Stand up another node and install FusionAuth `1.x` on it.
* Replace another node running `1.x-1` out of the load balancer with the new node running `1.x`.
* Repeat until you have updated all the nodes.

There's an [open issue for n-1 version compatibility](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1240).
Please vote that up if this is important to you.
