## Overview

<Aside type="version">
  Available since 1.50.0
</Aside>

Scope management in FusionAuth allows an administrator to define OAuth scopes and the messaging used on the OAuth consent screen when these scopes are requested.

Scopes in FusionAuth are associated with an [application](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/applications). While there is no limit to the number of scopes an application can have, each must have a unique name.

By providing the `scope` parameter on an OAuth request, you can limit the scope of access for the resulting access token. Providing a `scope` value that matches the level of access the token needs for the current workflow enhances security by limiting what can be done with the token if it is intercepted or stolen.

For applications that do not have the same owner as the authorization server, called third-party applications in FusionAuth, OAuth scopes and the [themeable](/docs/customize/look-and-feel) consent prompt allow users the chance to limit the information shared with the third-party or decline access to their information entirely.

This page provides more detail around managing custom OAuth scopes. The [OAuth Scopes](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/scopes) page has more information on configuring how the application handles scopes, including the consent prompt.

## Managing Scopes

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/manage-scopes.png" alt="Manage Scopes Page" width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

This is the Manage Scopes homepage for a given application. From here you can see a list of all the configured OAuth scopes
as well as perform the following actions:

|                          |                                               |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| <Icon name="plus"/>      | **Create** a new OAuth scope                  |
| <Icon name="edit"/>      | **Edit** a previously created OAuth scope     |
| <Icon name="fa-search"/> | **View** a previously created OAuth scope     |
| <Icon name="trash"/>     | **Remove** a previously created OAuth scope   |


### Create and Edit a Scope

Creating and editing scopes for an application is straight forward.

Here is what you can expect when creating a new scope:

<Aside type="note">
  Once created, a scope is implicitly enabled and can be requested by the application during an OAuth workflow.
</Aside>

Here is what you can expect when updating an existing scope:

#### Form Fields

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Name" required>
    The name of the OAuth scope. This is the value that will be used to request the scope in OAuth workflows.

    <Aside type="note">
      Once a scope has been created the name cannot be updated. In this situation, you will need to create a new scope and delete the old one.
    </Aside>
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Description" optional>
    A description of the OAuth scope for internal use.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Consent message" optional>
    The default message to display on the OAuth consent screen if one cannot be found in the theme.
    [Learn more about setting this value using themes.](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/localization#oauth-scope-consent-prompt)
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Consent details" optional>
    The default detail to display on the OAuth consent screen if one cannot be found in the theme.
    [Learn more about setting this value using themes.](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/localization#oauth-scope-consent-prompt)
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Required" optional>
    Determines if the OAuth scope is required when requested in an OAuth workflow.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

### View a Scope

Additional details about a particular OAuth scope can be viewed by clicking the <Icon name="fa-search"/> action:

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/manage-scopes-view.png" alt="Manage Scopes - View Scope" width="1200" />

### Remove a Scope

When a scope is no longer needed, it can be removed by clicking the <Icon name="trash"/> action:

<Aside type="note">
  Deleting a scope can impact the OAuth workflows for an application in different ways depending on the
  [Unknown scope policy](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/applications#scopes) configured for that application.
  It will also affect resource servers or APIs which may be expecting a scope to be presented in a token.
