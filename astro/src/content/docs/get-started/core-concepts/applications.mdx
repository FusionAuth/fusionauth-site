## Overview

A FusionAuth Application is simply something a user can log into. When you use the Login API, you will provide an `applicationId` to indicate what resource you're attempting to obtain authorization. When you use one of the OAuth2 / OpenID Connect authorization grants you will provide a `client_id` in some fashion. This client identifier will be unique to a single FusionAuth Application which allows FusionAuth to verify the User is registered for the requested Application and subsequently return the correct roles. The `applicationId` and `client_id` can be considered synonymous, both concepts use the same `Id` value.

A FusionAuth Application holds configuration for how your applications interact with FusionAuth. A one to one mapping between an external web, mobile or desktop application and a FusionAuth Application is not required. All of these mappings are supported:

* One to one. Each application has one Application configuration.
* Many to one. Multiple web and mobile applications use one FusionAuth Application config.
* One to many. One web application can auth against multiple FusionAuth Applications, if different authentication scenarios needed to be handled in one application (this isn't very common, though).

Here's a brief video covering some aspects of applications:

## Core Concepts Relationships

Below is a visual reminder of the relationships between FusionAuth's primary core concepts.

<Diagram active="Application" />

## Admin UI

This page describes the admin UI for creating and configuring an Application.

### Add an Application

Before you start your integration with FusionAuth you need to set up at least one Application. Click on <strong>Applications</strong> from the left navigation to begin.

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/create-application.png" alt="Create an Application" width="1200" />

#### Form Fields

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Id" optional>
    An optional UUID. When this value is omitted a unique Id will be generated automatically. This will also be used as the <InlineField>Client Id</InlineField> in the <strong>OAuth</strong> configuration, so if you require a specific value for that, set it here. Application Ids are unique across all tenants.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Name" required>
    The name of the Application. This value is for display purposes only and can be changed at any time.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Tenant" required>
    The tenant in which to create this Application.

    This field is only displayed once multiple tenants exist in FusionAuth. When only a single tenant exists, the Application will always be created in the default tenant.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Theme" optional since="1.27.0">
    When a theme is selected, it will  be used for this application instead of the tenant theme.

    <PremiumPlanBlurbApi feature="application themes" />

  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

### Roles

The Roles tab will only be available on the Add Application form. To manage roles after the Application has been created you will use the Manage Roles action.

#### Table Columns

<RoleAttributes />

To manage Application Roles after you have added an Application, click the <Icon name="user"/> Manage Roles button on the index page. To edit an Application click the <Icon name="edit"/> edit icon. The following sections will walk you through each panel for the edit action.

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/applications.png" alt="Applications" width="1200" role="shadowed bottom-cropped" />

### OAuth

  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Default verification key" optional since="1.20.0">
    The verification key used to verify a signature when the SAML v2 Service Provider is using HTTP Redirect Bindings.

    When HTTP POST Bindings are used, this is the default verification key used if a `KeyInfo` element is not found in the SAML AuthNRequest. If a `KeyInfo` element is found, Key Master will be used to resolve the key and this configuration will not be used to verify the request signature.

    This field is required when <InlineField>Require signature</InlineField> is enabled.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Enable login hint" since="1.47.0">
    When enabled, FusionAuth will accept a username or email address as a login hint on a custom HTTP request parameter.

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/application-security.png" alt="Application Security" width="1200" />

#### Login API Settings

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Require an API key" optional>
    When enabled the Login API will require an API key. This is functionally equivalent to requiring client authentication during OAuth2.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Generate Refresh Tokens" optional>
    When enabled the Login API will return refresh tokens. This is functionally equivalent to requesting the offline_scope during an OAuth2 grant.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Enable JWT refresh" optional>
    When enabled a JWT may be refreshed using the JWT Refresh API. This is functionally equivalent to enabling the OAuth2 Refresh Grant.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

##### Access control lists settings

<PremiumPlanBlurb />

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Access control list" optional since="1.30.0">
    The IP access control list that will be used to restrict or allow access to hosted login pages in FusionAuth. Using this, you can allow access to or block specific IP addresses from an application's authentication pages (login, forgot password, etc).

    When configured, this value will override the IP access control list configuration on the tenant.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

#### Passwordless Login

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Enabled" optional>
    When enabled, allow users to request login using a link sent via email. Enabling this feature will cause a button to be displayed on the FusionAuth login form and allow you to utilize the Passwordless Login API.

</APIBlock>

#### Authentication Tokens

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Enabled" optional>
    When enabled, allow users to optionally authenticate using an Application specific token in place of their password. This should only be used when the security requirements are low and the user's normal password is not a good option for authentication.

    For example, if a password needs to be stored in an external configuration and the exposure risk is low, a token can be used in place of the user's password. This token may only be used for authorization for this application.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>


### Webhooks

<Aside type="caution">
This feature is removed as of version 1.37.0.

The Webhooks tab allows you to select one or more webhooks to be used for this Application. In this example screenshot either no webhooks have been configured, or no application specific webhooks are configured.

In most cases you will not need to configure this panel. Only a few specific events are considered application specific, and when a webhook is configured to be application specific, only those events will be sent to the webhook.

This example screenshot shows one Application specific webhook selected. This option will be visible if at least one webhook is configured as application specific.
