## Overview

A FusionAuth Application is simply something a user can log into. When you use the Login API, you will provide an `applicationId` to indicate what resource you're attempting to obtain authorization. When you use one of the OAuth2 / OpenID Connect authorization grants you will provide a `client_id` in some fashion. This client identifier will be unique to a single FusionAuth Application which allows FusionAuth to verify the User is registered for the requested Application and subsequently return the correct roles. The `applicationId` and `client_id` can be considered synonymous, both concepts use the same `Id` value.

A FusionAuth Application holds configuration for how your applications interact with FusionAuth. A one to one mapping between an external web, mobile or desktop application and a FusionAuth Application is not required. All of these mappings are supported:

* One to one. Each application has one Application configuration.
* Many to one. Multiple web and mobile applications use one FusionAuth Application config.
* One to many. One web application can auth against multiple FusionAuth Applications, if different authentication scenarios needed to be handled in one application (this isn't very common, though).

Here's a brief video covering some aspects of applications:

## Core Concepts Relationships

Below is a visual reminder of the relationships between FusionAuth's primary core concepts.

<Diagram active="Application" />

## Admin UI

This page describes the admin UI for creating and configuring an Application.

### Add an Application

Before you start your integration with FusionAuth you need to set up at least one Application. Click on <strong>Applications</strong> from the left navigation to begin.

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/create-application.png" alt="Create an Application" width="1200" />

#### Form Fields

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Id" optional>
    An optional UUID. When this value is omitted a unique Id will be generated automatically. This will also be used as the <InlineField>Client Id</InlineField> in the <strong>OAuth</strong> configuration, so if you require a specific value for that, set it here. Application Ids are unique across all tenants.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Name" required>
    The name of the Application. This value is for display purposes only and can be changed at any time.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Tenant" required>
    The tenant in which to create this Application.

    This field is only displayed once multiple tenants exist in FusionAuth. When only a single tenant exists, the Application will always be created in the default tenant.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Theme" optional since="1.27.0">
    When a theme is selected, it will  be used for this application instead of the tenant theme.

    <PremiumEditionBlurbApi feature="application themes" />

  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

### Roles

The Roles tab will only be available on the Add Application form. To manage roles after the Application has been created you will use the Manage Roles action.

#### Table Columns

<RoleAttributes />

To manage Application Roles after you have added an Application, click the <Icon name="user"/> Manage Roles button on the index page. To edit an Application click the <Icon name="edit"/> edit icon. The following sections will walk you through each panel for the edit action.

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/applications.png" alt="Applications" width="1200" role="shadowed bottom-cropped" />

### OAuth

The OAuth tab allows you to configure the OAuth2 and OpenID Connect settings specific to this Application.

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/application-oauth.png" alt="Application OAuth configuration" width="1200" />

#### Form Fields

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Client Id">
    The read only client Id for this Application. The client Id is used by OAuth2 / OpenID Connect to authenticate the grant request.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Client secret">
    The read only client secret used for client authentication. When you enable Require authentication, this client secret will be required to obtain an access token from the Token endpoint.

    You may optionally regenerate the client secret if you think it has been compromised.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Client Authentication" optional>
    This selector allows you to set a rule for accessing the [Token endpoint](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/endpoints#token).

     * Required - The `client_secret` parameter must be used. This is the default setting. In most cases you will not want to change this setting.
     * Not required - Use of the `client_secret` parameter is optional.
     * Not required when using PKCE - Requires the use of the `client_secret` parameter unless a valid PKCE [code_verifier](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636#section-4.1) parameter is used. This is useful for scenarios where you have a requirement to make a request to the Token endpoint where you cannot safely secure a client secret such as native mobile applications and single page applications (SPAs) running in a browser. In these scenarios it is recommended you use PKCE.

    See the [Token endpoint](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/endpoints#token) for more information.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="PKCE" optional>
    This selector allows you to set a rule for [Proof Key for Code Exchange](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636) (or PKCE) requirements when using the authorization code grant.

     * Required - The `code_verifier` parameter must be used. If you want to require PKCE for this application, set <InlineField>PKCE</InlineField> to this value.
     * Not required - Use of the `code_verifier` parameter is optional. This is the default setting.
     * Not required when using client authentication - Requires the use of the `code_verifier` parameter unless a valid `client_secret` parameter is used.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Generate refresh tokens" optional>
    When enabled, FusionAuth will return a refresh token when the `offline_access` scope has been requested. When this setting is disabled refresh tokens will not be generated even if the `offline_access` scope is requested.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Debug enabled" optional>
    Enable debug to create an event log to assist you in debugging integration errors.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="URL validation" optional since="1.43.0">
    Controls the validation policy for <InlineField>Authorized redirect URLs</InlineField> and <InlineField>Authorized request origin URLs</InlineField>.

    The possible values are:

    * `Exact match` - Only the configured values that do not contain wildcards are considered for validation. Values during OAuth 2.0 workflows must match a configured value exactly.
    * `Allow wildcards` - Configured values with and without wildcards are considered for validation. Values during OAuth 2.0 workflows can be matched against wildcard patterns or exactly match a configured value.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Authorized redirect URLs" optional>
    When OAuth grants, such as the authorization code grant, require a browser redirect to a URL found in the `redirect_uri` parameter, the destination URLs must be added to this list. URLs that are not authorized may not be utilized in the `redirect_uri` parameter or the `post_logout_redirect_uri` parameter.

    You can add as many URLs as you'd like to this list. Prior to version `1.43.0` only exact string matches with the provided `redirect_uri` will be allowed. No partial or wildcard matches will be accepted.

    <OAuthWildcardUsage fieldName="Authorized redirect URLs" wildcard="Allow wildcards" />
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Authorized request origin URLs" optional>
    This optional configuration allows you to restrict the origin of an OAuth2 / OpenID Connect grant request. If no origins are registered for this Application, all origins are allowed.

    By default FusionAuth will add the `X-Frame-Options: DENY` HTTP response header to the login pages to keep these pages from being rendered in an iframe. If the request comes from an authorized origin, however, FusionAuth will not add this header to the response. To load FusionAuth hosted login pages in an iframe, you will need to add the request origin to this configuration.

   <OAuthWildcardUsage fieldName="Authorized request origin URLs" wildcard="Allow wildcards" />
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Logout URL" optional>
    The optional logout URL for this Application. When provided this logout URL should handle the logout of a user in your application.

    If you need to end an HTTP session, or delete cookies to logout a user from your application, these operations should be handled by this URL. When the `/oauth2/logout` endpoint is utilized, each Logout URL registered for Applications in this tenant will be called within an iframe to complete the SSO logout.

    If the OAuth2 logout endpoint is used with this Client Id, this configured Logout URL will be also utilized as the redirect URL. This behavior only occurs when the `post_logout_redirect_uri` parameter is not provided.

    If this Application has not defined a Logout URL, the value configured at the Tenant level will be used. If no Logout URL has been configured, a redirect to `/` will occur. A specific redirect URL may also be provided by using the `post_logout_redirect_uri` request parameter.

    See the [Logout endpoint](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/endpoints#logout) for more information.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Logout behavior" optional>
    This selector allows you to modify the behavior when using the [Logout endpoint](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/endpoints#logout) with this Client Id.

        * All applications - This is the default behavior. Upon Logout of the FusionAuth SSO, call each registered Logout URLs for the entire tenant and then redirect to the Logout URL registered for this application.
        * Redirect only - Do not call each registered Logout URL in the tenant, instead logout out of the FusionAuth SSO and then only redirect to the Logout URL registered for this application.

    See the [Logout endpoint](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/endpoints#logout) for more information.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Enabled grants" optional>
    The enabled OAuth2 grants. If a grant is not enabled and a client requests this grant during authentication an error will be returned to the caller indicating the grant is not enabled.

        * Authorization Code
        * Device
        * Implicit
        * Password
        * Refresh Token

    See The [OAuth 2.0 & OpenID Connect Overview](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/) for additional information on each of these grants.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Require registration" optional>
    When enabled the user will be required to be registered, or complete registration before redirecting to the configured callback in the authorization code grant or the implicit grant. This configuration does not affect any other grant, and does not affect the API usage.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

When you enable the `Device` grant you will be shown one additional configuration field:

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/application-oauth-device-url.png" alt="Application OAuth configuration Device URL" width="1200" role="top-cropped" />

#### Form Fields

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Device verification URL" required>
    The URL to be returned during the Device Authorization request to be displayed to the end user. This URL will be where the end user navigates in order to complete the device authentication workflow.

    Required when the `Device` grant has been enabled.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

### CleanSpeak

The CleanSpeak configuration panel allows you to optionally configure username filtering through the use of a CleanSpeak integration. See [CleanSpeak Integration](/docs/lifecycle/manage-users/cleanspeak) for additional configuration details.

The use of this feature requires a licensed instance of CleanSpeak. See https://cleanspeak.com for additional information.

</APIBlock>

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/application-saml-authentication-request.png" alt="Application SAML authentication request settings" width="1200" role="bottom-cropped top-cropped" />

#### Authentication Request

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Require signature" optional>
    When enabled, all unsigned requests will be rejected.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Default verification key" optional since="1.20.0">
    The verification key used to verify a signature when the SAML v2 Service Provider is using HTTP Redirect Bindings. +

    When HTTP POST Bindings are used, this is the default verification key used if a `KeyInfo` element is not found in the SAML AuthNRequest. If a `KeyInfo` element is found, Key Master will be used to resolve the key and this configuration will not be used to verify the request signature.

    This field is required when <InlineField>Require signature</InlineField> is enabled.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Enable login hint" since="1.47.0">
    When enabled, FusionAuth will accept a username or email address as a login hint on a custom HTTP request parameter.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Login hint parameter name" optional defaults="login_hint" since="1.47.0">
    The name of the login hint parameter provided by the service provider on an AuthnRequest. If this parameter is present, its value will be used to pre-populate the username field on the FusionAuth login form.

    For example, suppose <InlineField>Enable login hint</InlineField> is enabled and <InlineField>Login hint parameter name</InlineField> has the value `login_name`. When FusionAuth is set up as an IdP, the SP can send a request which includes the parameter `login_name=richard@example.com`, and FusionAuth will pre-populate richard@example.com into the login form the end user sees.

    Note that this setting names an HTTP query parameter, not an element in the SAML AuthnRequest XML.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

#### Logout Response

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Signing key" optional defaults="Assertion" since="1.25.0">
    The signing key used to sign the SAML logout request. When this value is not selected the Authentication Response <InlineField>Signing key</InlineField> will be used.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Signature canonicalization method" optional since="1.25.0">
    The XML signature canonicalization method. If you are unsure which method to select, leave the default and begin testing, or contact your service provider for configuration assistance.

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/application-saml-assertion-encryption.png" alt="Application SAML assertion encryption settings" role="top-cropped" />

#### Assertion Encryption

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Enabled" optional defaults="false" since="1.47.0">
    When enabled, assertions in SAML responses will be encrypted.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Encryption algorithm" optional since="1.47.0">
    The symmetric key encryption algorithm used to encrypt the SAML assertion.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Key location" optional defaults="Child" since="1.47.0">
    The location that the encrypted symmetric key information will be placed in the SAML response in relation to the `EncryptedData` element containing the encrypted assertion value.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Key transport algorithm" optional since="1.47.0">
    The encryption algorithm used to encrypt the symmetric key for transport in the SAML response.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Digest algorithm" optional since="1.47.0">
    The message digest algorithm to use when encrypting the symmetric key for transport.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Mask generation function" optional since="1.47.0">
    The mask generation function and hash function to use for the Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding when encrypting a symmetric key for transport. This configuration is only available when <InlineField>Key transport algorithm</InlineField> is set to `RSA OAEP with MGF1`.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Key transport encryption certificate" optional since="1.47.0">
    The RSA certificate from Key Master that will be used to encrypt the SAML assertion encryption symmetric key for transport.

    This field is required when SAML assertion encryption is enabled.
  </APIField>

### Security

The security tab contains some additional security configuration for this application.

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/application-security.png" alt="Application Security" width="1200" />

#### Login API Settings

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Require an API key" optional>
    When enabled the Login API will require an API key. This is functionally equivalent to requiring client authentication during OAuth2.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Generate Refresh Tokens" optional>
    When enabled the Login API will return refresh tokens. This is functionally equivalent to requesting the offline_scope during an OAuth2 grant.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Enable JWT refresh" optional>
    When enabled a JWT may be refreshed using the JWT Refresh API. This is functionally equivalent to enabling the OAuth2 Refresh Grant.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

##### Access control lists settings

<PremiumEditionBlurb />

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Access control list" optional since="1.30.0">
    The IP access control list that will be used to restrict or allow access to hosted login pages in FusionAuth. Using this, you can allow access to or block specific IP addresses from an application's authentication pages (login, forgot password, etc).

    When configured, this value will override the IP access control list configuration on the tenant.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

#### Passwordless Login

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Enabled" optional>
    When enabled, allow users to request login using a link sent via email. Enabling this feature will cause a button to be displayed on the FusionAuth login form and allow you to utilize the Passwordless Login API.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

#### Authentication Tokens

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Enabled" optional>
    When enabled, allow users to optionally authenticate using an Application specific token in place of their password. This should only be used when the security requirements are low and the user's normal password is not a good option for authentication.

    For example, if a password needs to be stored in an external configuration and the exposure risk is low, a token can be used in place of the user's password. This token may only be used for authorization for this application.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>


### Webhooks

<Aside type="caution">
This feature is removed as of version 1.37.0.
</Aside>

The Webhooks tab allows you to select one or more webhooks to be used for this Application. In this example screenshot either no webhooks have been configured, or no application specific webhooks are configured.

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/application-webhooks-none.png" alt="No Application Webhooks" width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

In most cases you will not need to configure this panel. Only a few specific events are considered application specific, and when a webhook is configured to be application specific, only those events will be sent to the webhook.

This example screenshot shows one Application specific webhook selected. This option will be visible if at least one webhook is configured as application specific.
