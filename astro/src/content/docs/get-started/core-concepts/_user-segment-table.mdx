| Option     | Strengths | Challenges    |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| { props.showLinks ? <a href='#tenants'>Tenants</a> : "Tenants" }  | True separation of users, API keys, connectors and other user related configuration  | Cross-tenant user access, users can't be moved between tenants without resetting password or drip migration |
| { props.showLinks ? <a href='#applications-and-registrations'>Applications and Registrations</a> : "Applications and Registrations" } | Inherits settings from containing tenant, can separate users based on registration, with paid plan can configure application specific themes, unlimited roles| If FusionAuth SSO then enabled user can SSO between each application, must check tokens in application to verify access|
| { props.showLinks ? <a href='#groups'>Groups</a> : "Groups" } | Contained in a tenant, can apply application roles to all members | Can't apply registrations to all members of a group, need lambda API call to add membership to tokens |
| { props.showLinks ? <a href='#entities-and-grants'>Entities And Grants</a> : "Entities And Grants" } | Fine grained permissions, searchable, can cross-cut applications, can manage permissions between users and entities or entities and entities | Requires proprietary APIs to manage, no inheritance of permissions, need lambda API call to add membership to tokens |
| { props.showLinks ? <a href='#the-userdata-field'>User.data</a> : "User.data" } | Searchable, arbitrary JSON that you control, easily added to tokens | Pure data so all authorization decisions need to be made by your application, need to be careful with data types |
