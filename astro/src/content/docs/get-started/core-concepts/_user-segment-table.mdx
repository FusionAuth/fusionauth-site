| Option     | Strengths | Challenges    |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| [Tenants](#tenants) | True separation of users, API keys, connectors and other user related configuration  | Cross-tenant user access, users can't be moved between tenants without resetting password |
| [Applications and Registrations](#applications-and-registrations) | Inherits settings from containing tenant, can separate users based on registration, with paid plan can configure application specific themes, unlimited roles| If FusionAuth SSO enabled user can SSO between each application, must check tokens in application |
| [Groups](#groups) | Contained in a tenant, can apply application roles to all members | Can't apply registrations to all members of a group, need lambda API call to add membership to tokens |
| [Entities And Grants](#entities-and-grants) | Fine grained permissions, searchable, can cross-cut applications, can manage permissions between users and entities or entities and entities | Requires proprietary APIs to manage, no inheritance of permissions, need lambda API call to add membership to tokens |
| [User.data](#the-userdata-field) | Searchable, arbitrary JSON that you control, easily added to tokens | Pure data so all authorization decisions need to be made by your application, need to be careful with data types |
