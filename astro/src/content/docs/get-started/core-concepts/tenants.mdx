## Overview

FusionAuth is fundamentally a single tenant solution, so you may be surprised to learn that we support multiple tenants.

FusionAuth will always be a single tenant solution, this means that your instance of FusionAuth is your own and even when FusionAuth is hosting, we do not co-mingle your data with other clients. FusionAuth was built as a single tenant solution, and we have no plans to change anytime soon.

It is entirely likely that our clients may wish to be multi-tenant or offer their services to more than one client. In these scenarios it may be useful to separate Users, Applications and Groups for each of your clients.

For example, let's assume you are building a payroll offering using a SaaS model. In this case it is possible that `monica@piedpiper.com` works for two of your clients, Acme Corp and The Umbrella Company. Because Monica is not aware that Acme Corp and The Umbrella Company both are buying their Payroll software from the same vendor it would be surprising for Monica to share the same password and account details between these two companies. In this scenario you would likely want to utilize the FusionAuth Tenant to ensure that `monica@piedpiper.com` exists once for each instance of your Payroll offering.

See [Tenant API Authentication](/docs/apis/authentication#making-an-api-request-using-a-tenant-id) for more details about making API requests in a multi-tenant configuration.

Here's a brief video covering some aspects of tenants:

## Core Concepts Relationships

Below is a visual reminder of the relationships between FusionAuth's primary core concepts.

![Diagram showing Tenants used within FusionAuth.](/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/core-concepts-relationships-tenants.png)

## Admin UI

This page describes the admin UI for creating and configuring a Tenant.

### List of Tenants

To display a list of tenants, navigate to <Breadcrumb>Tenants</Breadcrumb>.

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/tenant-configuration-list.png" alt="List of Tenants" width="1200" role="bottom-cropped" />

Using the icons on this screen, you can:

* <Icon name="plus" /> Create a new tenant
* <Icon name="trash" /> Delete the tenant configuration
  * You cannot delete the [Default tenant](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/limitations#default-configuration).
* <Icon name="copy" /> Duplicate the tenant configuration
* <Icon name="edit" /> Edit the tenant configuration
* <Icon name="fa-search" /> View the tenant configuration


### Create a Tenant

To create a new tenant, navigate to <Breadcrumb>Tenants</Breadcrumb>.

![Create a Tenant.](/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/create-tenant.png)

### Tenant Configuration

A majority of your FusionAuth configuration is managed at the Tenant-level.  Some of these configuration options act as defaults and can be overridden by the Application.

### General
<img src="/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/tenant-configuration-general.png" alt="Tenant Configuration - General" width="1200" role="shadowed" />

#### Form Fields

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Issuer" required>
    The named issuer used to sign tokens. This is generally your public fully qualified domain with the `https://` protocol prefix. For example, `https://example.com`.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Login Theme" optional>
    The Theme associated with this Tenant; determines which templates to render for interactive work-flows.

    The form that will be used in the FusionAuth UI for adding and editing users.

<PremiumPlanBlurb />
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

#### Username settings

Enable <InlineField>Unique usernames</InlineField> to allow multiple users suggest the same username. If there are any collisions, FusionAuth will transparently create a unique username by appending a suffix. The user will continue to use the username without the suffix.

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Unique usernames" optional defaults="false" since="1.27.0">
    When `true`, FusionAuth will handle username collisions.

<PremiumPlanBlurb />
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Number of digits" optional defaults="5" since="1.27.0">
    The maximum number of digits to use when building a unique suffix for a username. A number will be randomly selected and may be 1 or more digits up to this configured value. The value of this field must be greater than or equal to `3` and less than or equal to `10`.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Separator character" optional since="1.27.0">
    A single character to use as a separator from the requested username and a unique suffix that is added when a duplicate username is detected. This value can be a single non alphanumeric ASCII character.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

### Connectors

Connectors can be enabled on a per tenant basis with a Connector policy.

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/tenant-connector-tab.png" alt="The Tenant Connector policy configuration tab." width="1200" role="shadowed" />

You can find details on adding a connector below. Full documentation on Connectors and Connector Policies can be found [here](/docs/lifecycle/migrate-users/connectors/).

#### Add Connector Policy Dialog

If you click on the <InlineUIElement>Add policy</InlineUIElement> button on this page you will be presented with the following dialog.

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/tenant-configuration-connector-add-policy.png" alt="Add Connector Policy" width="300" role="box-shadow" />

    The Connector to be used for this policy.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Domains" optional defaults='["*"]'>
    One or more line separated domains to be used to filter incoming authentication requests. To match all incoming email addresses, a single entry using an asterisk `*` can be used.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Migrate user" optional>
    When selected, migrate the user from the Connector into FusionAuth so that future authentications will use FusionAuth and not the Connector.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

### Email

Once you have configured your email settings, you may test your configuration with the "Send test email" button.

### WebAuthn

<LicensedPlanBlurb version="1.52.0" />

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/tenant-configuration-webauthn.png" alt="Tenant Configuration - WebAuthn" width="1200"  role="bottom-cropped" />

#### Form Fields

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Enabled" optional>
    When enabled, WebAuthn is available for the tenant, and additional configuration options will be available.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Relying party Id" optional>
    The Relying Party Id is used to scope WebAuthn passkeys to the site where they were registered. As part of WebAuthn's security requirements, this value must be either:

     * The browser request origin's effective domain
     * A registrable domain suffix of the effective domain

    For example, if the login page is at `auth.piedpiper.com`, then the following are valid Relying Party Ids:

     * `auth.piedpiper.com` - matches the effective domain
     * `piedpiper.com` - a registrable suffix of the effective domain

    But the following values are _not_ valid:

     * `m.auth.piedpiper.com` - a subdomain of the effective domain
     * `com` - this is a suffix of the effective domain but not registrable

    It is important that this is configured according to the URL that a user would see in their browser while on the FusionAuth login page. See the [WebAuthn Admin Guide](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/passwordless/webauthn) for more details on how to select the appropriate value.

    Leaving this value empty will cause the [WebAuthn JavaScript API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API) to use the browser's current request origin.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Relying party name" optional>
    The Relying Party name for WebAuthn ceremonies. This value may be displayed to the user by the browser or OS during WebAuthn registration and authentication ceremonies.

    If this value is left blank, the <InlineField>Issuer</InlineField> value will be used.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Debug enabled" optional>
    Enable debug to create an event log to assist you in debugging integration errors.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/tenant-configuration-webauthn-bootstrap-settings.png" alt="Tenant Configuration - WebAuthn Bootstrap settings" width="1200"  role="top-cropped" bottom-cropped="undefined" />

#### Bootstrap settings

The settings in this section affect the availability and behavior of the WebAuthn bootstrap workflow. The bootstrap workflow is used when the user must "bootstrap" the authentication process by identifying themselves prior to the WebAuthn ceremony and can be used to authenticate from a new device using WebAuthn.

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Enabled" optional>
    When enabled, the WebAuthn bootstrap workflow can be used to authenticate users via WebAuthn from new or repeat devices.

    The availability of the bootstrap workflow can be overridden at the application level on the [WebAuthn Tab of the Application settings](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/applications#webauthn).
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Authenticator attachment" optional>
    The authenticator attachment preference for the bootstrap workflow on this tenant. This value controls the attachment requirement for authenticators during the bootstrap workflow registration ceremony. Authenticators that do not meet the requirement are not considered during passkey registration. The possible values are:

     * `Any` - any authenticator attachment is allowed
     * `Platform only` - only authenticators integrated with the client device are allowed
     * `Cross-platform only` - only authenticators that are usable across multiple client devices are allowed

    The recommended value for the bootstrap workflow is `Any` when the option is available.

<EnterprisePlanBlurbApi feature="WebAuthn cross-platform authenticators" />
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="User verification" optional>
    The user verification requirement for the bootstrap workflow on this tenant. This value controls whether user verification is required for registration and authentication ceremonies during the bootstrap workflow. Authenticators that do not meet the requirement are not considered during passkey registration or authentication. The possible values are:

     * `Required` - user verification is required to complete the WebAuthn ceremony
     * `Preferred` - the Relying Party prefers user verification is provided but will not fail the WebAuthn ceremony without it
     * `Discouraged` - the Relying Party does not want user verification for the WebAuthn ceremony

    Because the bootstrap workflow is used to authenticate a user, it is _highly_ recommended to set this value to `Required`.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

<img src="/img/docs/get-started/core-concepts/tenant-configuration-webauthn-reauthentication-settings.png" alt="Tenant Configuration - WebAuthn Re-authentication settings" width="1200"  role="top-cropped" bottom-cropped="undefined" />

#### Re-authentication settings

The settings in this section affect the availability and behavior of the WebAuthn re-authentication workflow. The re-authentication workflow is meant to provide a streamlined user experience when logging in from a frequently used device.

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Enabled" optional>
    When enabled, the WebAuthn re-authentication workflow can be used to streamline the login experience when authenticating from a previously used device.

    The availability of the re-authentication workflow can be overridden at the application level on the [WebAuthn Tab of the Application settings](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/applications#webauthn).
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Authenticator attachment" optional>
    The authenticator attachment preference for the re-authentication workflow on this tenant. This value controls the attachment requirement for authenticators during the re-authentication workflow registration ceremony. Authenticators that do not meet the requirement are not considered during passkey registration. The possible values are:

     * `Any` - any authenticator attachment is allowed
     * `Platform only` - only authenticators integrated with the client device are allowed
     * `Cross-platform only` - only authenticators that are usable across multiple client devices are allowed

    The recommended value for the re-authentication workflow is `Platform only` to ensure the user has access to that authenticator when logging from the device in the future.

<EnterprisePlanBlurbApi feature="WebAuthn cross-platform authenticators" />
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="User verification" optional>
    The user verification requirement for the re-authentication workflow on this tenant. This value controls whether user verification is required for registration and authentication ceremonies during the re-authentication workflow. Authenticators that do not meet the requirement are not considered during passkey registration or authentication. The possible values are:

     * `Required` - user verification is required to complete the WebAuthn ceremony
     * `Preferred` - the Relying Party prefers user verification is provided but will not fail the WebAuthn ceremony without it
     * `Discouraged` - the Relying Party does not want user verification for the WebAuthn ceremony

    Because the re-authentication workflow is used to authenticate a user, it is _highly_ recommended to set this value to `Required`.
  </APIField>

    The number of failed attempts allowed during the specified time period before the selected action is applied.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Time period" required>
    The window of time in seconds for which the failed authentication attempts are counted. If no further failed attempts occur the failure count will be reset after this time period starting at the time of the last failed login.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Action duration" required>
    The length of time the selected action is applied to the user before the action expires at which point the user will be allowed to attempt log in again.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Time unit" optional>

  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Cancel action on password reset" since="1.42.0">
    Indicates whether you want the user to be able to self-service unlock their account prior to the action duration by completing a password reset workflow.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Email user" since="1.42.0">
    Indicates you would like to email the user when the user's account is locked due to this action being taken. This requires the User Action specified by the <InlineField>User action</InlineField> to also be configured for email. If the User Action is not configured to be able to email the user, this configuration will be ignored.

    The email template configuration will be in the User Action.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

#### Rate limit settings

<EnterprisePlanBlurb />

The Rate limit settings allow you to set a number of times an action can be attempted within a specific time frame. When the limit is exceeded, that action is unavailable until the configured time frame elapses without a failed attempt. The settings are evaluated and enforced per user.

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Action">
    The action to be rate limited.

    *Note:* For the `Failed login` action, rate limiting can be used in combination with [Failed authentication settings](#failed-authentication-settings).
