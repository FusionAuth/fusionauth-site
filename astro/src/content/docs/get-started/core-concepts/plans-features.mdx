## Overview

<LicensingPremiumFeaturesIntro />

After giving a summary of some features differing between FusionAuth editions, this article will explain the differences between hosting FusionAuth yourself, and having it hosted and managed for you in the cloud.

## Plans and Features

FusionAuth has different plans which have different features.
They are also called editions.

* `Community` has all features not otherwise labeled in the documentation.
* `Licensed Community` has all licensed community features.
* `Starter` has all premium features, but some may have some numeric or usage limits.
* `Essentials` has all advanced and premium features, but some may have some numeric limits.
* `Enterprise` has all enterprise, advanced and premium features and no limits.

Please review the [features page](https://fusionauth.io/feature-list) for much more information on plans and features.

## Feature List

Here are the major features available in each licensed plan.

### Licensed Community Features

<Features plan="licensed" />

### Premium Features

<Features plan="premium" />

### Advanced Features

<Features plan="advanced" />

### Enterprise Features

<Features plan="enterprise"/>

## Feature Documentation

The FusionAuth documentation calls out features not part of the Community plan so you can make an informed decision about which plan works for you.

If a feature you are using requires a license, you may also encounter an error message in the administrative user interface or in an API message.

### Licensed Community Features

Throughout the documentation, you'll see features available to all licensed plans marked like so:

<LicensedPlanBlurb version="1.52.0" />

In the API documentation, you'll see licensed features marked like this:

<LicensedPlanBlurbApi feature="this feature" />

### Premium Features

Throughout the documentation, you'll see premium features marked like so:

<PremiumPlanBlurb />

In the API documentation, you'll see premium features marked like this:

<PremiumPlanBlurbApi feature="this feature" />


### Advanced Features

Throughout the documentation, you'll see advanced features marked like so:

<AdvancedPlanBlurb />

In the API documentation, you'll see advanced features marked like this:

<AdvancedPlanBlurbApi feature="this feature" />

### Enterprise Features

Throughout the documentation, you'll see enterprise features marked like so:

<EnterprisePlanBlurb />

In the API documentation, you'll see enterprise features marked like this:

<EnterprisePlanBlurbApi feature="this feature" />

## Self-hosted FusionAuth Versus Cloud-Hosted FusionAuth

Once you have chosen an edition of FusionAuth that has the features you want, you need to decide where to host FusionAuth. You can either host it yourself, on a dedicated server on your premises or with a cloud service company like Hetzner or AWS, or you can allow the FusionAuth creators, Inversoft, to host FusionAuth for you. The choice between self-hosting and cloud-hosting is completely independent of which FusionAuth edition you choose. Any edition of FusionAuth can be hosted either by you or by us. There is no difference in features between hosts.

Let's first consider how each hosting type works, and then the advantages of each.

### How Each Hosting Type Works

For self-hosting, you download the FusionAuth software (or more likely, a Docker image of the software), and run it together with a PostgreSQL server. (You might also run ElasticSearch, but it's unnecessary). You have full control over the configuration of FusionAuth, but have to manage and maintain all the following considerations:
- Database backups
- Monitoring and error checking
- Networking
- Upgrades to PostgreSQL and FusionAuth
- Server scaling and migration as your users increase

To learn how to run FusionAuth on your own host, read this [guide](https://fusionauth.io/docs/get-started/download-and-install/docker).

For cloud-hosting, you create a FusionAuth cloud account and choose an edition type. You can then start and stop as many instances of FusionAuth (called deployments) as you want through the web interface. You pay for each deployment for as long as it runs, but don't have worry about any of considerations of self-hosting.

Specifically, when cloud-hosting, you:
- Cannot edit the FusionAuth instance configuration page, like you can when self-hosting.
- Can choose when to upgrade FusionAuth to the latest version, but the process itself is automated.

To learn how use cloud hosting in detail, read this [guide](https://fusionauth.io/docs/get-started/run-in-the-cloud/cloud). To estimate the fees for the deployments in your account, use the [pricing calculator](https://account.fusionauth.io/pricing-calculator).

### Advantages Of Each Hosting Type

Self-hosting gives you complete control over FusionAuth, including the ability to use [Kickstart](https://fusionauth.io/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/kickstart) to start an instance with the exact configuration you need, including sample applications and users. You can use Kickstart in conjunction with Github or continuous deployment services to deploy any number and configuration of FusionAuth instances. The FusionAuth database runs on your host, and you can run any SQL queries you want against it to extract data for analytics, import users, or edit data in bulk.

Cloud-hosting offers you less work and more flexibility than self-hosting. Starting and stopping a deployment is a few clicks, as is upgrading. Deployments scale easily as your number of customers grow, using more powerful cloud instances that can handle a greater authentication workload. Backups are automated, and available if you need to roll back your database at any time. A team of FusionAuth experts manages the cloud environment, available if you need support. You can also purchase a 99.99% uptime SLA (service level agreement) to guarantee that your site will always be available.

Cloud-hosting offers less control than self-hosting in exchange for convenience. Be aware that you can't do the following things when cloud-hosting:
- Access the database to extract data or run SQL scripts. However, you can request the support team send you your database backup file, or extract data using the FusionAuth API.
- Create your own database backups. Backups are fixed in number and time by the plan you choose.
- Use Kickstart. You need to configure each deployment manually using the web interface, or by writing a script to call the FusionAuth API to set up applications, entities, and groups similar to how Kickstart does it.
- Access OpenTelemetry data to monitor your instance.
- Use different FusionAuth editions on different deployments. If you use FusionAuth for one product that has complex authentication needs, and a smaller service you offer that needs just a username and password, both deployments will have to use the more expensive FusionAuth license. Alternatively, you can create a separate cloud account with a separate FusionAuth license for the second service.

### Use Cases For Each Hosting Type

Self-hosting is free, which is perfect for testing FusionAuth, local development, or if you already have spare resources on an existing server. You can also host FusionAuth wherever you want, even on a private network, which may be a requirement for the data regulations of your organization. Self-hosting is a good choice if your team has the knowledge and time to manage FusionAuth.

Cloud-hosting is a good choice for small businesses that want to spend as little time as possible managing infrastructure, or that don't know enough about FusionAuth and server management to safely host FusionAuth themselves. Cloud-hosting is also useful when you might need to scale your authentication server up or down easily if you have variable numbers of users.

If there is no obvious advantage to you for either option, compare the cost of self-hosting and cloud-hosting to decide. Self-hosting is a good choice when you have an infrastructure team with spare time to monitor and maintain your own instances. Cloud-hosting costs money, but saves your infrastructure team time. You need to calculate the total cost of cloud-hosting your deployments against your employees' hours spent maintaining FusionAuth, and the potential cost of downtime if your local FusionAuth instance breaks.
