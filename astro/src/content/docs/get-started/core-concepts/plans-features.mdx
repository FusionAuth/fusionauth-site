## Overview

<LicensingPremiumFeaturesIntro />

After giving a summary of some features differing between FA editions, this article will explain the differences between hosting FA yourself, and allowing the FA organization to host it for you in the cloud.

## Plans and Features

FusionAuth has different plans which have different features.
They are also called editions.

* `Community` has all features not otherwise labeled in the documentation.
* `Licensed Community` has all licensed community features.
* `Starter` has all premium features, but some may have some numeric or usage limits.
* `Essentials` has all advanced and premium features, but some may have some numeric limits.
* `Enterprise` has all enterprise, advanced and premium features and no limits.

Please review the [features page](https://fusionauth.io/feature-list) for much more information on plans and features.

## Feature List

Here are the major features available in each licensed plan.

### Licensed Community Features

<Features plan="licensed" />

## Feature Documentation

The FusionAuth documentation calls out features not part of the Community plan so you can make an informed decision about which plan works for you.

If a feature you are using requires a license, you may also encounter an error message in the administrative user interface or in an API message.

### Licensed Community Features

## Self-hosted FA Versus Cloud-Hosted FA

Once you have chosen an edition of FA that has the features you want, you need to decide where to host FA. You can either host it yourself, on a dedicated server on your premises or with a cloud service company like Hetzner or AWS, or you can allow the FA organization to host FA for you. The choice between self-hosting and cloud-hosting is completely independent of which FA edition you chose. Any edition of FA can be hosted either by you or by us.

Let's first consider how each hosting type works, and then the advantages of each.

### How Each Hosting Type Works

For self-hosting, you download the FA software (or more likely, a Docker image of the software), and run it together with a PostgreSQL server. You might also run ElasticSearch, but it's unnecessary. You have full control over the configuration of FA. You have to manage and maintain all the following considerations:
- Database backups
- Monitoring and error checking
- Networking
- Upgrades to PostgreSQL and FA
- Server scaling and migration as your users increase
- Multiple environments for dev, QA, and production

###
Cloud limitations

no database access or sql scripts - only use api
backups are fixed by your plan, costly
deployment api vs fa api
no kickstart
no opentelemtry data for monitoring
one plan across all deployments on your account. if you want a deployment on a different plan, you need to create another fa account

## TODO

FA -> FusionAuth
rename branch to draft
