  <APIField name="Event">
    The event type, this value will be present in the JSON request to identify the message.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Description">
    The description of the event.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Enabled">
    When enabled this event can be sent by one or more webhook. You will also need to enable the event for a specific webhook to receive the event.

    This toggle allows you to optionally disable an event for all webhooks all at once.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Transaction setting">
    The transaction setting for this event. This setting will apply to all webhooks consuming this event type.


    <strong>No Webhooks are required to succeed</strong>:
    The event will succeed regardless of the webhook response status code. Use this setting when it is not important for a webhook to succeed or provide confirmation that the event has been received and processed successfully.
    <div class="border"/>

    <strong>Any single Webhook must succeed</strong>:
    The event will succeed as long as one or more of the webhooks respond with a status code between `200` and `299` (inclusive).
    <div class="border"/>

    <strong>A simple majority of Webhooks must succeed</strong>:
    The event will succeed if at least half of the webhooks respond with a status code between `200` and `299` (inclusive). This means 50% or more of the webhooks must respond successfully.
    <div class="border"/>

    <strong>A two-thirds majority of Webhooks must succeed</strong>:
    The event will succeed if a super majority of the webhooks respond with a status code between `200` and `299` (inclusive). A super majority is two-thirds (66.7%) or more of the configured webhooks.
    <div class="border"/>

    <strong>All of the Webhooks must succeed</strong>:
    The event will succeed if every configured webhook responds with a status code between `200` and `299` (inclusive). Use this setting when it is critical for every configured webhook to receive and process the event before considering it complete.
