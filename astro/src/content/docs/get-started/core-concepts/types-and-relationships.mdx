This overview summarizes all the FusionAuth types and how they relate. (To avoid confusion with FusionAuth Applications in this review, the service you provide your users will be called your "website", as opposed to an application, app, or service.)

The first set of FusionAuth types are: **Tenants**, **Applications**, **Groups**, **Roles**, and **Users**. These types manage users logging in to an application. (Applications are sometimes called clients in other systems).

The second set of types are: **Entity Types**, **Entities**, **Permissions**, and **Entity Grants**. These types were added to FusionAuth in 2021, after the original set of types in the previous paragraph. They are used for machine-to-machine authentication, and as a case-specific way to model things (entities), as opposed to organizations.

### Applications And Users

Think of a tenant as an entirely separate instance of FusionAuth, without actually running a separate instance. A tenant completely separates all users and applications from those in any other tenant, even when they have the same names and email addresses.

An application represents an organization, website, or service that a person (a user) logs in to. A user has personal data, an email address, and any amount of custom data stored in JSON. A user is a member of an application through a registration. Users can have registrations to many applications, or none.

Applications have roles. A role is just a string. A registration can add many roles to a user for an application. Your website can use a user's role however it wants: authorize a user to perform special actions or ignore the role entirely.

A group is a collection of users. A user can belong to multiple groups, so you can think of a group as a tag that can be applied to a user. A group can have many roles in many applications. If a user has a group, and the user is also registered with an application, that user will automatically be granted any roles in the application that the group has.

For example, consider an example of a bank website with clients and employees. The bank website is an application in FusionAuth. The application has two roles: client and employee. Your clients and employees are users, that each have a single registration in the bank application. Each registration may give the user either the client or employee role, or both.

If you want, you could make groups called client and employee, with the client and employee roles in the application respectively. Then you would add users to either or both groups, and register the users with the application, but would not need to give the users roles manually. This would be useful if you had a lot of roles. Another use of groups is to tag users with certain attributes, such as VIP users.

<Aside type="caution">
Digital security usually involves three types: users, roles, and permissions. A user can have many roles, and roles can have many permissions. The advantage of not granting users permissions directly are:
- You can add (or remove) permissions to a role and they automatically apply to every user in that role. You don't have to add a permission to a million users individually.
- A user can have multiple roles with multiple permissions, and the user automatically gets the superset of permissions from all their roles. You don't have to consider each user as an individual and specify the exact combination of permissions that their job requires.
- Your website can work only with permissions when checking if a user has rights to do something, and doesn't have to worry about mapping users through roles to permissions itself.

However, FusionAuth does not have permissions. There is a GitHub feature request to add them. Vote [here](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/15) if you want that feature.

There are two workarounds:

- Treat roles as permissions. In other words, instead of the employee role, make roles called "can edit clients", "can adjust salaries", and so on. When a user logs in with FusionAuth, your website will receive a list of exactly what "permissions" (roles) the user has. But now you have lost all the advantages of working with roles described above.
- Manage permissions in your website code. Keep the user and role associations in FusionAuth, but link roles to permissions in your website database, not in FusionAuth. When a user logs in with FusionAuth, your website will lookup in the database and retrieve all permissions you have associated with those roles and add them to the user. This treats FusionAuth more as an authentication system than an authorization system.

### Entities And Permissions

An entity in FusionAuth is just a name, and can represent anything — a company, document, or refrigerator. The only functional aspect to an entity is that it can be used for machine-to-machine authentication with the client credentials OAuth flow. In this case, an entity usually represents a service. Entities require a paid FusionAuth license and are not available in the free edition.

An entity has an entity type. The type of an entity cannot be changed once it has been created. An entity type can have many permissions, which are also just strings.

Both users and entities can be linked to entities by entity grants. An entity grant lists which permissions of an entity the linked user or entity has access to.

For example, you could make an entity type called Company with an entity called ChangeBank with permissions ReadAccess and WriteAccess. You could make another Company entity called ChangeInsurance with an entity grant to ChangeBank that has the ReadAccess permission. An employee who is a user, described in the previous section, could also have an entity grant with ReadAccess to the ChangeBank entity.

Like with roles, permissions have no functional meaning in FusionAuth. They are just strings passed to your website when a user logs in, and your website can use them however you like.

### A Diagram Of All FusionAuth Types

Below is a diagram illustrating the relationships in the examples from the previous sections, combining the type name with the example object of that type. Read the diagram from bottom to top to see who is a member of what, or who has what attributes.

Note that entities and applications cannot be related, even if they represent the same physical company. Only users can have entity grants to entities.

There are only two permission blocks in this diagram to avoid clutter. This isn't quite accurate, as in FusionAuth each entity grant would point to a separate permission — objects don't share permissions.
