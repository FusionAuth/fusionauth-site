FusionAuth is available in the following cloud marketplaces:

* [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=30ecc80d-f96e-4259-ae1c-fc3b994f90ea)
* [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/fusionauth-action) for CI/CD pipelines
* [DigitalOcean](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/fusionauth)

## Paid Features

Once you install FusionAuth using the marketplace, you can [add a license](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/licensing). Doing so will allow you to use [additional features](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/editions-features).

You can add a license:

* [using kickstart](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/development/kickstart#set-your-license-id) (for GitHub actions)
* manually using [the Reactor page in the Admin UI](/fusionauth.io/docs/get-started/core-concepts/licensing#adding-your-license-to-your-instance)
* using the [Reactor API](/docs/apis/reactor)
