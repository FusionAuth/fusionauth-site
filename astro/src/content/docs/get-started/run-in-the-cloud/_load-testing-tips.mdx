Performance bottlenecks are typically the database or the CPU nodes, depending on sizing of each of these components and primary functionality tested. For example, both logins and creating users use a lot of CPU due to password hashing. Make sure each of these components are monitored and sized appropriately.

If testing a multi-node system behind a load balancer, ensure that you have disabled sticky sessions, as they are not required for FusionAuth functionality.
