## Notes

Brief - https://docs.google.com/document/d/16ql1wY7kPI4MxESMzMaK2pLCa3ZdSxQcsqbT9tY5qq8/edit

### Brief

- Document how to set up Fusionauth in a CI environment (GitHub actions)
- Use kickstart to set the system up to a known state (example here: https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-python-client/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yaml)
- Use Selenium or some other tool (e.g. Playwright) to create an end-to-end  functionality test (e.g. can a user log in?)
- Bonus points if we can figure out how to get Fusionauth available in the GitHub marketplace so users can install it from there instead of manually on the CI runner.

## Introduction

Things users want to automate deployment of:

- Test that login works through terminal.
- Test login works from their app. A web page GUI tester.
- Upgrade FusionAuth to a new version.
- Leave FusionAuth untouched on server if no changes have been made to kickstart files or FusionAuth version.
- Set up CD functionality through a GitHub marketplace action.
