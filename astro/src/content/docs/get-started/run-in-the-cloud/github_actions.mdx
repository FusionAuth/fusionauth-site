## Notes

Brief - https://docs.google.com/document/d/16ql1wY7kPI4MxESMzMaK2pLCa3ZdSxQcsqbT9tY5qq8/edit

### Brief

- Document how to set up Fusionauth in a CI environment (GitHub actions)
- Use kickstart to set the system up to a known state (example here: https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-python-client/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yaml)
- Use Selenium or some other tool (e.g. Playwright) to create an end-to-end  functionality test (e.g. can a user log in?)
- Bonus points if we can figure out how to get Fusionauth available in the GitHub marketplace so users can install it from there instead of manually on the CI runner.

### Todo

- [x] plan project
- [x] read cloud docs on fa docs site
- [x] how does one upgrade fa without losing database? show example with different docker versions on dockerhub
- [x] choose tester:
  - selenium is java based
  - puppeteer is chrome only
  - cypress is complex and has a gui
  - playwright looks good - js. cross browser. headless.
- [x] make article outline
- [ ] make test repo
- [ ] run an lxc container with demo rust app, fa, and test login with gui tester (selenium, playwright, the thing i used for ekaya)
- [ ] do the same thing in a github action
- [ ] learn about github actions marketplace
- [ ] decide what the marketplace action should do (all 3 os?)
- [ ] write and deploy the action
- [ ] write the article

## Introduction

Things users want to automate deployment of:
- When pushing to main branch, deploy their app and FusionAuth to AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean, or a custom server.
- Test that login works through terminal.
- Test login works from their app. A web page GUI tester.
- Upgrade FusionAuth to a new version.
- Leave FusionAuth untouched on server if no changes have been made to kickstart files or FusionAuth version.
- Set up CD functionality through a GitHub marketplace action.

- Testing login works should be done in the action. The final test of logging to the deployed app can be done by hand when checking the site is actually up.
