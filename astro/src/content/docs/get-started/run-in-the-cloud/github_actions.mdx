## Notes

Brief - https://docs.google.com/document/d/16ql1wY7kPI4MxESMzMaK2pLCa3ZdSxQcsqbT9tY5qq8/edit

### Brief

- Document how to set up Fusionauth in a CI environment (GitHub actions)
- Use kickstart to set the system up to a known state (example here: https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-python-client/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yaml)
- Use Selenium or some other tool (e.g. Playwright) to create an end-to-end  functionality test (e.g. can a user log in?)
- Bonus points if we can figure out how to get Fusionauth available in the GitHub marketplace so users can install it from there instead of manually on the CI runner.
- Resources
  - https://fusionauth.io/community/forum/topic/898/how-do-i-use-fusionauth-in-my-ci-cd-system
  - https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-site/issues/1663
  - https://fusionauth.io/docs/get-started/run-in-the-cloud/

### Todo

- [x] plan project
- [x] read cloud docs on fa docs site
- [x] how does one upgrade fa without losing database? show example with different docker versions on dockerhub
- [x] choose tester:
  - selenium is java based
  - puppeteer is chrome only
  - cypress is complex and has a gui
  - playwright looks good - js. cross browser. headless.
- [x] make article outline
- [x] make test repo - https://github.com/ritza-co/fusionauth_github_actions
- [x] do the same thing in a github action
- [x] how to upgrade FA and backup
- [ ] how to deploy to prod
- [ ] learn about github actions marketplace
- [ ] decide what the marketplace action should do (all 3 os?)
- [ ] write and deploy the action to marketplace
- [ ] write the article
  - [ ] target audience - newbies to fa and actions
  - [ ] mention fa cloud paid service
  - [ ] secrets and .env
  - [ ] how to test live site
  - [ ] add images

## Introduction

This article explains:
- How to upgrade FusionAuth
- How to write automated tests of your application login with FusionAuth
- How to run these tests in a GitHub Action when pushing to the main branch
- How to automate deployment and testing on your live application

To understand this article, you need to know how to create a project in GitHub, but don't need to know anything about FusionAuth, GitHub actions, or automated testing. The basics are explained here.

## Some Definitions And Goals

FusionAuth provides all login functionality for your web application. It stores users in its own database, separate to the database your app uses to keep its data. Assuming you have built a login page that redirects a user to FusionAuth for login, your system will have the components shown below.

```mermaid
graph LR
  subgraph app [ ]
    direction TB
    1[App website] --> 2[Database]
  end

  subgraph auth [ ]
    direction TB
    3[FusionAuth website] --> 4[Database]
  end

  app <--> auth
```

You might have the following questions:
- How do I deploy all this to production?
- What happens when FusionAuth releases a new version? How do I upgrade it without losing data?
- How can I test that login still works after upgrading my app or FusionAuth?
- How do I separate and manage my development and production environments?
- Where do I keep database passwords safely and include them when deploying?

Automating these tasks above is called continuous integration / continuous deployment (CI/CD).
- CI refers to testing that changes to code you push to the main branch fits in with the existing system and everything still works.
- CD refers to deploying every push to the main branch to your production (live) site.

GitHub provides a tool for automating workflows called GitHub actions. It provides a virtual machine in which you can run scripts to check out your code, compile it, deploy alongside FusionAuth and other services, run tests, and deploy everything.

The flow looks like the diagram below.

```mermaid
graph TD
    1[üë®‚Äçüíª Programmer] --> 2[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Push to main branch on GitHub]
    2 --> 3[üé¨ GitHub action triggers]
    3 --> 4[üõ†Ô∏è Build app in a virtual machine]
    subgraph Inside GitHub Action
        4 --> 5[üî¨ Test app can log in with FusionAuth]
        5 -- Deploy --> 6[‚òÅÔ∏è AWS]
        5 -- Deploy --> 7[‚òÅÔ∏è Azure]
        5 -- Deploy --> 8[‚òÅÔ∏è Virtual server]
    end
```

```

## Dev, Test, QA, Preprod, And Prod Environments


- Testing login works should be done in the action. The final test of logging to the deployed app can be done by hand when checking the site is actually up.
