## Overview

This page contains the APIs that are used to manage User Registrations. A registration is the association between a User and an Application that they log into. Here are the APIs:

## Create a User Registration (for an existing user)

This API is used to create a new User Registration for an existing User. If the User has already created their global account but is now creating an account for an Application, this is the API you will use to create the new account. You must specify the User Id being registered on the URI. The Id of the Application the User is registering for is sent in the request body.

### Request

<APIAuthentication icon="lock">Create a User Registration for an existing User</APIAuthentication>
<APIURI method="POST">/api/user/registration/`{userId}`</APIURI>

#### Request Parameters

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="userId" type="UUID" required>
    The Id of the User that is registering for the Application.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

<XFusionauthTenantIdHeaderScopedOperation />

<UserRegistrationRequestBody http_method="POST" />

### Response

The response for this API contains the User Registration that was created. Security sensitive fields will not be returned in the response.

<StandardPostResponseCodes missing_message="The user specified by Id in the request parameter does not exist. The response will be empty." />

<UserRegistrationResponseBody registration_create_response />

## Create a User and Registration (combined)

This API is used to create a new User and a User Registration in a single request. This is useful if for example you have a main website that User's create their account on initially. The User is technically creating their global User object and a User Registration for that website (i.e. that Application). In this case, you will want to create the User and the User Registration in a single step. This is the API to use for that. You can optionally still provide an Id for the new User on the URI. If you don't specify an Id for the User, FusionAuth will create one for you.

### Request

<APIAuthentication icon="lock">Create a User and a User Registration in a single API call</APIAuthentication>
<APIURI method="POST">/api/user/registration/`{userId}`</APIURI>

#### Request Parameters

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="userId" type="UUID" optional>
    The Id to use for the new User. If you don't specify this, FusionAuth will generate a random UUID.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

<XFusionauthTenantIdHeaderCreateOperation />

<UserRegistrationCombinedRequestBody registration_create_response />

### Response

The response for this API contains the User and the User Registration that were created. Security sensitive fields will not be returned in the response.

<StandardPostResponseCodes create_user />

<UserRegistrationCombinedResponseBody registration_create_response />


## Retrieve a User Registration

This API is used to retrieve a single User Registration. This is the information about a User for a single Application.

### Request

<APIAuthentication icon="lock">Retrieve a User Registration for the User Id and Application Id</APIAuthentication>
<APIURI method="GET">/api/user/registration/`{userId}/{applicationId}`</APIURI>

#### Request Parameters

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="applicationId" type="UUID" required>
    The Id of the Application that the User is registered for.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="userId" type="UUID" required>
    The Id of the User whose registration is being retrieved.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

<XFusionauthTenantIdHeaderScopedOperation />

### Response

The response for this API contains the User Registration.

  <APIField name="applicationId" type="UUID" required since="1.25.0">
    The Id of the Application for which the User is registered.

    While required, this parameter may be provided in the request body as well. If the `applicationId` is provided in both the URL and the request body, the value on the URL will take precedence. Prior to version `1.25.0` this value must be provided in the request body.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="userId" type="UUID" required>
    The Id of the User that is updating their User Registration for the Application.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

<XFusionauthTenantIdHeaderScopedOperation />

<StandardPutResponseCodes />

<UserRegistrationResponseBody />


## Delete a User Registration

This API is used to delete a single User Registration.

### Request

<APIAuthentication icon="lock">Delete a User Registration by providing the User Id and the Application Id</APIAuthentication>
<APIURI method="DELETE">/api/user/registration/`{userId}/{applicationId}`</APIURI>

#### Request Parameters

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="applicationId" type="UUID" required>
    The Id of the Application for which the User will no longer be registered.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="userId" type="UUID" required>
    The Id of the User whose registration is being removed.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

<XFusionauthTenantIdHeaderScopedOperation />

### Response

The response for this API does not contain a body. It only contains one of the status codes listed below.

<StandardDeleteResponseCodes />

## Verify a User Registration

This API is used to mark a User Registration as verified. This is usually called after the User receives the registration verification email after they register and they click the link in the email.

### Request

<APIAuthentication icon="unlock">Verifies the User Registration using a `verificationId`.</APIAuthentication>

<APIURI method="POST">/api/user/verify-registration</APIURI>

<APIURI method="POST">/api/user/verify-registration/`{verificationId}`</APIURI>

#### Request Parameters

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="verificationId" type="String" required deprecated>
    The verification Id generated by FusionAuth used to verify the User's registration is valid by ensuring they have access to the provided email address.

    <span class="text-red-700">Deprecated in version 1.27.0</span>

    This value can still be provided on the URL segment as shown in the above example, but it is recommended you send this value in the request body instead using the <InlineField>verificationId</InlineField> field. If the value is provided in the URL segment and in the request body, the value provided in the request body will be preferred.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

#### Request Body

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="oneTimeCode" type="String" optional since="1.27.0">
    The short code used to verify the User's registration is valid by ensuring they have access to the provided email address. This field is required when the registration <InlineField>verification strategy</InlineField> on the Application is set to `FormField`.

    This field is required when the registration <InlineField>verification strategy</InlineField> on the Application is set to `Form field`.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="verificationId" type="String" required since="1.27.0">
    The verification Id generated by FusionAuth used to verify the User's registration is valid by ensuring they have access to the provided email address.

    When using the `Form field` strategy for registration verification, this value is used along with the `oneTimeCode` as a pair to verify the registration.

    If the <InlineField>verificationId</InlineField> is provided in the URL segment and in the request body, the value provided in the request body will be preferred.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

<XFusionauthTenantIdHeaderScopedOperation />

### Response

The response does not contain a body. It only contains one of the status codes below.

## Resend a User Registration Verification Email

This API is used to resend the registration verification email to a User. This API is useful if the User has deleted the email, or the verification Id has
 expired. By default, the verification Id will expire after 24 hours.

### Request

<APIAuthentication icon="unlock">Resend the registration verification email</APIAuthentication>
<APIURI method="PUT">/api/user/verify-registration`?applicationId={applicationId}&email={email}`</APIURI>

#### Request Parameters

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="applicationId" type="UUID" required>
    The unique Id of the Application for this User registration.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="email" type="String" required>
    The email address used to uniquely identify the User.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

<XFusionauthTenantIdHeaderScopedOperation />

<br/>
<APIAuthentication icon="lock">Resend the registration verification email using an API key</APIAuthentication>
<APIURI method="PUT">/api/user/verify-registration`?applicationId={applicationId}&email={email}&sendVerifyRegistrationEmail={sendVerifyRegistrationEmail}`</APIURI>

#### Request Parameters

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="applicationId" type="UUID" required>
    The unique Id of the Application for this User registration.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="email" type="String" required>
    The email address used to uniquely identify the User.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="sendVerifyRegistrationEmail" type="Boolean" optional defaults="true">
    If you would only like to generate a new `verificationId` and return it in the JSON body without FusionAuth attempting to send the User an email
    set this optional parameter to `false`.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

This may be useful if you need to integrate the Registration Verification process using a third party messaging service.
