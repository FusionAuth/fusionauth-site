  <APIField name="user[x].data.email" type="String" optional>
    This field will be used as the email address if no <InlineField>user.email</InlineField> field is found. This field may be modified by advanced registration forms or the API. Setting this value to another account's email address allows that account to, in some cases, access information about this user. 

    If user `richard` has a <InlineField>user.data.email</InlineField> with a value of `dinesh@fusionauth.io`, whoever controls `dinesh@fusionauth.io` has elevated access to the `richard` account. That user can now reset the password on the `richard` account, for example. This functionality may be useful in certain scenarios, such as when accounts must share an email address. Think through the security ramifications before using this feature.

    This feature was removed in version 1.26.0 and added back in in 1.27.2.
