#### Response Body

This response body is returned only when the first method is added. After that, this call does not return a JSON response body.

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="code" type="String" since="1.42.0">
    Code generated to complete a Two Factor login if `twoFactorId` is provided on the request.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="recoveryCodes" type="Array">
    A list of recovery codes. These may be used in place of a code provided by an MFA factor. They are single use.

    If a recovery code is used in a disable request, all MFA methods are removed. If, after that, a Multi-Factor method is added, a new set of recovery codes will be generated.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>
