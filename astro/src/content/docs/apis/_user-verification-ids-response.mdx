<APIField name="emailVerificationId" type="String" since="1.27.0">
  An email verification Id. When present, this will represent the user's current email verification Id.

  When using `FormField` verification strategy, this is the first part of the pair of verification Ids, and the <InlineField>emailVerificationOneTimeCode</InlineField> is the second part. When `ClickableLink` is the verification strategy, this value is sensitive in that this value by itself can be used to verify the user's email address.

  When `ClickableLink` is the verification strategy, this is the value that will have been emailed to the user in order to complete verification. If you have not configured SMTP, you may optionally use this value to use an out of band transport such as your own email service.

  Prior to version `1.49.0`, this value was only returned when using `FormField` verification strategy. Beginning in `1.49.0` the value is always returned when available.
</APIField>

<APIField name="emailVerificationOneTimeCode" type="String" since="1.49.0">
  An email one time code that will be paired with the <InlineField>emailVerificationId</InlineField>.

  When `FormField` is the verification strategy, this is the value that will have been emailed to the user in order to complete verification. If you have not configured SMTP, you may optionally use this value to use an out of band transport such as your own email service.

  This value will only be present when using the `FormField` verification strategy. When present, this is the value the user will need to enter to complete email verification.
</APIField>

<APIField name="verificationIds" type="Array" since="1.59.0">
  The list of all identity verifications that exist for a user. This includes the email and phone identities that a user may have. The values from <InlineField>emailVerificationId</InlineField> and <InlineField>emailVerificationOneTimeCode</InlineField> are legacy fields and will also be present in this list.
</APIField>

<APIField name="verificationIds[x].id" type="String" since="1.59.0">
  An identity verification Id.

  When using `FormField` verification strategy, FusionAuth provides two values, a verification Id (this value) and the <InlineField>verificationIds\[x].oneTimeCode</InlineField> value.

  When `ClickableLink` is the verification strategy, this is the value FusionAuth sends to the user in order to complete identity verification. If you have not configured SMTP or an SMS messenger, you may optionally use this value to use an out-of-band transport such as your own email service to deliver this value.

  Note that when `ClickableLink` is the verification strategy, this value is sensitive in that it can be used to verify the user's email address or phone number.
</APIField>

<APIField name="verificationIds[x].oneTimeCode" type="String" since="1.59.0">
  A one time code that will be paired with the <InlineField>verificationIds\[x].id</InlineField>.

  When `FormField` is the verification strategy, this is the value FusionAuth sends to the user in order to complete verification. If you have not configured SMTP or an SMS messenger, you may optionally send this value using an out-of-band transport such as your own email service.
