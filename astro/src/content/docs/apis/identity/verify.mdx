## Overview

<Aside type="version">
  This API has been available since 1.99.9
</Aside>

This page contains the APIs for verifying the identity of a user. This includes starting the verification process, sending verification requests, and completing the verification. This is similar to the [Verify Email](/docs/apis/users#verify-a-users-email) API but it supports all verifiable identity types (email and phone number).

## Start Identity Verification

This API allows you to generate a verification code for a user. This code can be sent to the user via email or SMS using the Send Identity Verification API. The user will then use this code to complete the verification process.

### Request

<API method="POST" uri="/api/identity/verify/start" authentication={["api-key"]}
     title="Start verification" />

<XFusionauthTenantIdHeaderScopedOperation />

#### Request Body

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="loginId" type="String">
    The login identifier of the user to begin verification for. The login identifier can be one of the following:
    * Email address
    * Phone number

    <Aside type="note">
      For <InlineField>email</InlineField>, the value will be used exactly as provided to resolve a user. If the provided value contains leading or trailing white space, these characters will not be removed, and then would only match if the values stored in FusionAuth also contain these same leading or trailing spaces.

      For <InlineField>phoneNumber</InlineField>, <InlineField>loginId</InlineField> can be any valid phone number (in E.164, national, or international format) and FusionAuth will canonicalize the value. Thus the user will be resolved if the user's E.164 formatted phone number matches the canonical E.164 phone number from <InlineField>loginId</InlineField>. If no country code is provided, a US/NANP country code of 1 is assumed.
    </Aside>
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="loginIdType" type="String">
    The identity type that FusionAuth will compare the <InlineField>loginId</InlineField> to. Can be one of the following:

    * `email`
    * `phoneNumber`
  </APIField>

  <APIField name="applicationId"></APIField>
  <APIField name="state"></APIField>
  <APIField name="verificationStrategy"></APIField>
</APIBlock>
