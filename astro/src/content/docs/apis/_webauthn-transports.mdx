FusionAuth treats the list of transports as strings to maximize authenticator compatibility. These values are used as hints during WebAuthn ceremonies and missing, extra, or unexpected values should not cause a ceremony to fail. Some common values are:

 * `internal` - the authenticator is integrated with the client device
 * `usb` - the authenticator can be contacted over USB
 * `nfc` - the authenticator can be contacted over Near Field Communication (NFC)
 * `ble` - the authenticator can be contacted over Bluetooth Smart (Bluetooth Low Energy, or BLE)
 * `cable` - "cloud-assisted" BLE. This transport is used for Android devices acting as an authenticator connected to the computer over Bluetooth
 * `hybrid` - replacement for the `cable` transport
