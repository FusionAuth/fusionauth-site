## Overview

This page contains the APIs that are used for actioning users.

<Aside type="note">
Refer to the [User Actions guide](/docs/lifecycle/manage-users/user-actions) for an overview of how to use User Actions.
</Aside>

Once you have created the User Actions, either via the administrative user interface or the [User Actions API](/docs/apis/user-actions), you use this API to invoke a User Action on a User.

## Take an Action on a User

This API is used to take a User Action on a User. User Actions are the method that FusionAuth uses to discipline, reward and interact with Users.

### Request

<APIAuthentication icon="lock">Take an action on a User</APIAuthentication>
<APIURI method="POST">/api/user/action</APIURI>

<XFusionauthTenantIdHeaderScopedOperation />

<ActionUserRequestBody />

### Response

The response for this API contains the User Action along with any event and email information that was generated by FusionAuth.

<StandardPostResponseCodes webhook_event />

<ActionUserResponseBody userActionIncludeHistory={false} userActionJSONFile="take-response.json" />


## Retrieve a Previously Taken Action

This API is used to retrieve a User Action that was previously taken on a User, this can be thought of as the log or historical record.

### Request

<APIAuthentication icon="lock">Retrieve a specific User Action Log by Id.</APIAuthentication>
<APIURI method="GET">/api/user/action/`{actionId}`</APIURI>

#### Request Parameters

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="actionId" type="UUID" required>
    The unique Id of the Action to retrieve.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

<XFusionauthTenantIdHeaderScopedOperation />

<APIAuthentication icon="lock">Retrieve all the Actions for a specific User by the User Id.</APIAuthentication>
<APIURI method="GET">/api/user/action`?userId={userId}&active={active}&preventingLogin={preventingLogin}`</APIURI>

#### Request Parameters

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="userId" type="UUID" required>
    The unique Id of the User for which to retrieve all of the Actions.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="active" type="Boolean" optional>
    When this parameter is provided and set to `true`, only active actions will be returned. When this parameter is provided and set to `false`, only the inactive actions will be returned. When this parameter is omitted, all actions will be returned.

    An active action is a time based action that has not yet expired or been canceled. An inactive action is either a time based action that has expired, canceled or an action that is not time based.

    This parameter and `preventingLogin` are mutually exclusive.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="preventingLogin" type="Boolean" optional since="1.4.0">
    When this value is provided and set to `true`, only active actions that are preventing the user from login will be returned. Omitting this parameter, or setting this parameter to `false` does not affect the API behavior.

    This parameter and `active` are mutually exclusive because an action that is preventing login is always active.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

<XFusionauthTenantIdHeaderScopedOperation />

### Response

The response for this API contains either a single User Action Log or a list of User Actions Logs for a User. If you specified an `actionId` on the URI the response will contain the User Action Log for that Id. If you pass in a `userId` as a URL parameter the response will contain all of the User Action Logs for that User. Both responses are defined below along with an example JSON response.

<StandardGetResponseCodes />

<ActionUserResponseBody userActionIncludeHistory userActionJSONFile="response.json" />

<ActionUserListResponseBody userActionIncludeHistory userActionJSONFile="response.json" />

## Update a Previously Taken Action

This API is used to update a User Action that was previously taken on a User. User Actions are the method that FusionAuth uses to discipline, reward and interact with Users.
