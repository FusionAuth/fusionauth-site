#### Request Body

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="displayName" type="String" required>
    The primary display name for the new passkey.
  </APIField>

  <APIField name="name" type="String" optional>
    The optional name for the passkey. This is meant to disambiguate passkeys with the same <InlineField>displayName</InlineField>. When this parameter is omitted, it will be defaulted to the user's email address. If the user does not have an email address, this parameter will be defaulted to their username instead.

    Prior to version `1.42.0` <InlineField>name</InlineField> was defaulted to a random four character alphanumeric string.

    <Aside type="note">
      The passkey <InlineField>name</InlineField> is set at the time the passkey is registered. There is currently no way to change the name of the passkey. Prompts displayed by the WebAuthn JavaScript API will continue to display the original value at the time the passkey was registered even if the user updates their email address or username. In order to display the updated email or username the user must register a new passkey.
    </Aside>
  </APIField>

  <APIField name="userAgent" type="String" optional>
    The user's browser's user agent string. This value is meant for troubleshooting issues with passkeys.
  </APIField>

  <APIField name="userId" type="UUID" required>
    The Id of the user registering the passkey.
  </APIField>

  <APIField name="workflow" type="String" required>
    The WebAuthn workflow this passkey is intended to be used with. Selecting the proper value will provide the best user experience by limiting the registration ceremony to authenticators which support the features needed for each workflow. The selected workflow will change the creation options on the response based on the tenant configuration. The possible values are:

     * `bootstrap` - The passkey is intended for use with the bootstrap workflow, which requires the user to "bootstrap" the authentication process by identifying themselves prior to the WebAuthn ceremony and can be used to authenticate from a new device using WebAuthn.
     * `general` - The passkey is not intended for any particular workflow. This value will allow for the most flexible use of the new passkey.
     * `reauthentication` - The passkey is intended for use with the re-authentication workflow, which provides a streamlined user experience for repeated logins from the same device.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>
