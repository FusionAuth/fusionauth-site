## Overview

This page contains the APIs that are used to authenticate users without passwords using magic links and codes.

You also may find the [Magic Links guide](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/passwordless/magic-links) helpful.

<Aside type="note" title="Please note">
Prior to version `1.41.0`, magic links and codes were the only form of passwordless authentication supported by FusionAuth.

Therefore the user interface and API use the term `passwordless`, even though versions `1.41.0` and beyond support multiple kinds of passwordless authentication.

## Start Passwordless Login

<Aside type="version">
This API has been available since 1.11.0
</Aside>

This API allows you to generate a passwordless code that can be used to complete login. This is the first step in completing a passwordless login.

If you plan to utilize the FusionAuth login page then you will not need to use this API. Instead, once passwordless authentication is enabled for the FusionAuth Application, a new button will be presented to the user on the login page which will allow them to request an email.

### Request

<API method="POST" uri="/api/passwordless/start" authentication={["api-key"]} title="Generate a passwordless login code"/>

<XFusionauthTenantIdHeaderScopedOperation />

#### Request Body

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="applicationId" type="String" required>
    The unique Id of the Application you are requesting to log into.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="loginId" type="String" required>
    The login identifier of the user. The login identifier can be either the <InlineField>email</InlineField> or the <InlineField>username</InlineField>.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="state" type="Object" optional>
    An optional object that will be returned un-modified when you complete the passwordless login request. This may be useful to return the user to particular state once they complete login using the passwordless code.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

## Send Passwordless Login

This API allows you to send an email to a user that will contain a code that can be used to complete login. This API should be used if you want to build your own login page.

If you plan to utilize the FusionAuth login page then you will not need to use this API. Instead, once passwordless authentication is enabled for the FusionAuth Application, a new button will be presented to the user on the login page which will allow them to request an email.

This API does not require authentication.

### Request

<Aside type="version">
Available Since Version 1.11.0.
</Aside>

<API method="POST" uri="/api/passwordless/send" authentication={["none"]} title="Send the provided code via email"/>

#### Request Body

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="code" type="String" required since="1.11.0">
    The unique code to send via email, used to complete the login request.  This value can be generated with a call to the [Start Passwordless Login](#start-passwordless-login) API.

<JSON title="Example Request JSON" src="passwordless/send-request-code.json" />

<API method="POST" uri="/api/passwordless/send" authentication={["none"]} title="Generate a code and send a login link via email"/>

<Aside type="caution" title="Deprecated usage">
  This usage of the API may be removed at a later date. Once available prefer the usage outlined above which is available beginning in `1.11.0` which means you will need to use the Start API prior to calling this API.

## Complete a Passwordless Login

This API is used to complete the passwordless login request. This API should be used if you want to build your own login page.

If you plan to utilize the FusionAuth login page then you will not need to use this API. Instead, once passwordless authentication is enabled for the FusionAuth Application, a new button will be presented to the user on the login page which will allow them to request an email.

This API does not require authentication.

### Request

<API method="POST" uri="/api/passwordless/login" authentication={["none"]} title="Login using the code sent via email"/>

#### Request Headers

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="X-Forwarded-For" type="String" optional>
    The IP address of a client requesting authentication. If the IP address is provided it will be stored for login history of the user. It is
    generally preferred to specify the IP address in the request body. If it is not provided in the request body this header value will be used
    if available, the request body value will take precedence.
    <XFusionauthTenantIdHeaderScopedOperationRowOnly />
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

#### Request Cookies

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="fusionauth.trust" type="String" optional>
    The Two Factor Trust identifier returned by the Two Factor Login API response. This value may be provided to bypass the Two Factor challenge when a User has Two Factor enabled. When this cookie exists on the request it will take precedence over the <InlineField>twoFactorTrustId</InlineField> if provided in the request body.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

#### Request Parameters

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="applicationId" type="String" optional>
    The unique Id of the Application you are requesting to log into.  If omitted, no application-specific settings such as lambdas or email templates will be applied.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="code" type="String" required>
    The unique code sent via email used to complete the login request.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="ipAddress" type="String" optional>
    The IP address of the end-user that is logging into FusionAuth. If this value is omitted FusionAuth will attempt to obtain the IP address of
    the client, the value will be that of the `X-Forwarded-For` header if provided or the last proxy that sent the request. The IP address will
    be stored in the User login history.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="metaData.device.description" type="String" optional>
    A human readable description of the device used during login. This meta data is used to describe the refresh token that may be generated for this login request.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="metaData.device.name" type="String" optional>
    A human readable name of the device used during login.  This meta data is used to describe the refresh token that may be generated for this login request.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="metaData.device.type" type="String" optional>
    The type of device represented by the `device` parameter. This meta data is used to describe the refresh token that may be generated for this login request.

    Prior to version 1.46.0, this value was restricted to the following types:

<DeviceTypeList />

    In version `1.46.0` and beyond, this value can be any string value you'd like, have fun with it!
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="noJWT" type="Boolean" optional defaults="false">
    When this value is set to true a JWT will not be issued as part of this request. The response body will not contain the `token` or `refreshToken` fields, and the `access_token` and `refresh_token` cookies will not be written to the HTTP response.

    This optional parameter may be helpful when performing high volume authentication requests and the JWT is not being utilized, in this scenario removing the additional latency required to issue and sign the JWT may have a measurable cumulative effect on performance.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="twoFactorTrustId" type="String" optional>
    The Two Factor Trust identifier returned by the Two Factor Login API response. This value may be provided to bypass the Two Factor challenge when a User has Two Factor enabled.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

### Response

<LoginResponseCodes />

<UserResponseBody passwordless_login_response />

#### Response Cookies

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="access_token" type="String">
    The encoded access token. This cookie is written in the response as an HTTP Only session cookie.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="refresh_token" type="String">
    The refresh token. This cookie is written in the response as an HTTP only persistent cookie. The cookie expiration is configured in the JWT
    configuration for the application or the global JWT configuration.
