If you are using a version of FusionAuth before version 1.44.0, `UsePopup` won't work. `UseRedirect` will continue to work. Please see [the 1.44.0 release notes](/docs/release-notes/#version-1-44-0) for more information. [This forum post](/community/forum/topic/2329/upcoming-google-identity-provider-changes) has more details on an available workaround and upgrade process.
