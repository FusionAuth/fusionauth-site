The user does not need to exist yet in FusionAuth to utilize this API, depending on the configured [linking strategy](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/identity-providers/#linking-strategies). The `SAMLResponse` returned from the provider will be used to retrieve the user's information. If that user does not yet exist in FusionAuth the user may be created.

If <InlineField>createRegistration</InlineField> has been enabled for this identity provider and the user does not yet have a registration for this application, a registration will be automatically created for the user.

The user will be assigned any default roles configured for the application. If <InlineField>createRegistration</InlineField> has not been enabled, a registration will not be created if one does not yet exist. This last scenario is useful if you wish to manually provision users and then subsequently allow them to login with this identity provider.
