<APIField name="X-Forwarded-For" type="String" optional>
  The IP address of a client requesting authentication. If the IP address is provided it will be stored in the user's login record. It is generally preferred to specify the IP address in the request body. If it is not provided in the request body this header value will be used if available. However, the request body value takes precedence.
