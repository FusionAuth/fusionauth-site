<APIField name="identityProvider.linkingStrategy" type="String" optional defaults={props.idp_linking_strategy} since={ props.idp_since < 12800 ?"1.28.0" : ''}>
  The linking strategy to use when creating the link between the {props.idp_display_name} Identity Provider and the user.

  The possible values are:

    * `CreatePendingLink` - Do not automatically link, instead return a pending link identifier that can be used to link to an existing user.
    * `LinkAnonymously` - Always create a link based upon the unique Id returned by the identify provider. A username or email is not required and will not be used to link the user. A reconcile lambda will not be used in this configuration.
    * `LinkByEmail` - Link to an existing user based upon email. A user will be created with the email returned by the identity provider if one does not already exist.
    * `LinkByEmailForExistingUser` - Only link to an existing user based upon email. A user will not be created if one does not already exist with email returned by the identity provider.
    * `LinkByUsername` - Link to an existing user based upon username. A user will be created with the username returned by the identity provider if one does not already exist.
    * `LinkByUsernameForExistingUser` - Only link to an existing user based upon username. A user will not be created if one does not already exist with username returned by the identity provider.

   {props.idp_enforce_email_verified_claim && <p>
    When the <InlineField>identityProvider.linkingStrategy</InlineField> is equal to <code>LinkByEmail</code> or <code>LinkByEmailForExistingUser</code> and the <code>email_verified</code> claim is present on the response from the {props.idp_display_name} Identity Provider and the value is <code>false</code> a link will not be established and an error will be returned indicating a link cannot be established using an unverified email address.
   </p>}
