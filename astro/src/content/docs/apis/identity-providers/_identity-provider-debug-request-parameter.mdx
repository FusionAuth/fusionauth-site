<APIField name="identityProvider.debug" type="Boolean" optional defaults="false" since={props.idp_since < 10703 ? "1.7.3": ''}>
  Determines if debug is enabled for this provider. When enabled, an Event Log is created each time this provider is invoked to reconcile a login.

  This is useful for debugging purposes, but is not intended to be left on during production. It should be enabled during integration or if you are experiencing an issue with this identity provider.
