<APIField name="registrationVerificationIds" type="Map<UUID, List<String>" since="1.27.0">
  A map of registration verification Id keyed by the `application`. When present, this will represent the user's current registration verification Ids.

  When using <code>FormField</code> verification strategy, this is the first part of the pair of verification Ids, and the one time code in the <InlineField>registrationVerificationOneTimeCodes</InlineField> map is the second part. When <code>ClickableLink</code> is the verification strategy, this value is sensitive in that this value by itself can be used to verify the user's registration.

  When <code>ClickableLink</code> is the verification strategy, you may optionally use this value to use an out of band transport such as your own email service.

  Prior to version <code>1.49.0</code>, this value was only returned when using <code>FormField</code> verification strategy. Beginning in <code>1.49.0</code> the value is always returned when available.
</APIField>

<APIField name="registrationVerificationOneTimeCodes" type="Map<UUID, List<String>" since="1.49.2">
  A registration one time code that will be paired with the verification Id in the <InlineField>registrationVerificationIds</InlineField> map.

  When <code>FormField</code> is the verification strategy, you may optionally use this value to use an out of band transport such as your own email service.

  This value will only be present when using the <code>FormField</code> verification strategy. When present, this is the value the user will need to enter to complete registration verification.
