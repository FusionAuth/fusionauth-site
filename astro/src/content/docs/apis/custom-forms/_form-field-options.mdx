import InlineField from 'src/components/InlineField.astro';

A list of options that are applied to `checkbox`, `radio`, or `select` controls.

The options for a field must conform to the <InlineField>field.type</InlineField>. If the <InlineField>field.type</InlineField> is `number`, the options must be numbers. If the <InlineField>field.type</InlineField> is `boolean`, only `true` and/or `false` are allowed.

You may localize the displayed values during registration by adding these values to your theme.

For example, if you specify the values `["red", "green", "blue"]` as the field options, these will be stored on the user in this lowercase form. By default the values `red`, `green` and `blue` will be rendered in the UI.

If you were to add the following messages to your theme, the capitalized form of the values will be shown to the end user. This allows you to provide a human-readable form of the value and optionally localize the displayed values.

```properties title="Default"
red=Red
green=Green
blue=Blue
```

```properties title="Spanish"
red=Roja
green=Verde
blue=Azul
```
