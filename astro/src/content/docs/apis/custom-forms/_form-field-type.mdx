import InlineField from 'src/components/InlineField.astro';

The data type used to store the value in FusionAuth. The possible values are:

 * `bool` the value must be a boolean value, `true` or `false`
 * `consent` the value will be used to complete self consent
 * `date` the value will be stored as a date. The value must be formatted as ISO-8601 or `YYY-MM-DD`, you may want to use a JavaScript data picker that can convert the selected value to this format.
 * `email` the value will be expected to be a valid email address
 * `number` the value will be stored as a numerical value
 * `string` the value will be stored as a string


{ props.form_field_request && <>
All user provided input will be validated to ensure it can be stored in this data type. If the user input cannot be converted a validation error will be shown to the user. When providing options for this control each option must also be compatible with this data type.

When using the `consent` type, the field <InlineField>consentId</InlineField> is required and must be included in the request.

The data type can only be set for custom fields, and if not provided the default value will be `string`. For all managed fields, such as `user.firstName`, the data type will be set by FusionAuth and it may not be modified.
