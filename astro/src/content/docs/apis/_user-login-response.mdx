<APIField name="pendingIdPLinkId" type="String" since="1.28.0" renderif={!!props.idp_response}>
  The pending identity provider link Id. This value is created when logging in with an identity provider configured with a linking strategy of <code>Create a pending link</code>.

</APIField>

  <APIField name="refreshToken" type="String">
  The refresh token that can be used to obtain a new access token once the provided one has expired.

  Because a refresh token is per user and per application, this value will only be returned when an <InlineField>applicationId</InlineField> was provided on the login request and the user is registered to the application.

  You must explicitly allow generation of refresh tokens when using the Login API.

  Configure the <InlineField>application.loginConfiguration.generateRefreshTokens</InlineField> setting via the API or enable the setting by navigating to the <strong>Application -&gt; My Application -&gt; Security</strong> tab.

  When the <InlineField>refreshToken</InlineField> is returned in the response, this field will also be returned. This unique Id is the persistent identifier for this refresh token, and will not change even when using one-time use refresh tokens. This value may optionally be used to revoke the token using the <a href="/docs/apis/jwt#revoke-refresh-tokens">Refresh Token API</a>.
