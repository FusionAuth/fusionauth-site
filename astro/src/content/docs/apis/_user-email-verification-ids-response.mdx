<APIField name="emailVerificationId" type="String" since="1.27.0">
  An email verification Id. When present, this will represent the user's current email verification Id.

  When using <InlineFieldValue>FormField</InlineFieldValue> verification strategy, this is the first part of the pair of verification Ids, and the <InlineField>emailVerificationOneTimeCode</InlineField> is the second part. When <InlineFieldValue>ClickableLink</InlineFieldValue> is the verification strategy, this value is sensitive in that this value by itself can be used to verify the user's email address.

  When <InlineFieldValue>ClickableLink</InlineFieldValue> is the verification strategy, this is the value that will have been emailed to the user in order to complete verification. If you have not configured SMTP, you may optionally use this value to use an out of band transport such as your own email service.

  Prior to version `1.49.0`, this value was only returned when using <InlineFieldValue>FormField</InlineFieldValue> verification strategy. Beginning in `1.49.0` the value is always returned when available.
