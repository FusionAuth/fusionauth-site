## Overview

<Aside type="version">
  This API has been available since 1.99.9
</Aside>

This page contains the APIs for verifying the identity of a User. This includes starting the verification process, sending verification requests, and completing the verification. This is similar to the [Verify Email](/docs/apis/users#verify-a-users-email) API, but it supports all verifiable identity types (email and phone number).

When using these APIs, the general workflow is to call the start API, optionally call the send API to have FusionAuth send the verification message to the User, then call the complete API based on what the User has provided to complete verification. You will not often need to call these APIs directly but the main use cases for calling these APIs are:

| Use Case                                              | Start API                | Send API                | Complete API                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| User update                                           | (handled by FusionAuth)  | (handled by FusionAuth) | N/A                                                                                                            |
| Hosted Pages - login                                  | N/A                      | N/A                     | (handled by FusionAuth)                                                                                        |

## Start Identity Verification

This API allows you to generate a verification code for a User's identity. This code can be sent to the User via email or SMS using the [Send Identity Verification API](#send-identity-verification), or can be delivered by some other method of your choosing. The User will then use this code to complete the verification process.

### Request

<API method="POST" uri="/api/identity/verify/start" authentication={["api-key"]}
     title="Start identity verification" />

<XFusionauthTenantIdHeaderScopedOperation />

#### Request Body

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="loginId" type="String" required>
    The login identifier of the User identity to begin verification for. The login identifier can be one of the following:
    * Email address
    * Phone number

    <Aside type="note">
      For <InlineField>email</InlineField>, the value will be used exactly as provided to resolve a User. If the provided value contains leading or trailing white space, these characters will not be removed, and then would only match if the values stored in FusionAuth also contain these same leading or trailing spaces.

      For <InlineField>phoneNumber</InlineField>, <InlineField>loginId</InlineField> can be any valid phone number (in E.164, national, or international format) and FusionAuth will canonicalize the value. The User will be resolved if the User's E.164 formatted phone number matches the canonical E.164 phone number from <InlineField>loginId</InlineField>. If no country code is provided, a US/NANP country code of 1 is assumed.
    </Aside>
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="loginIdType" type="String" required>
    The identity type that FusionAuth will use when comparing the <InlineField>loginId</InlineField>. Can be one of the following:

    * `email`
    * `phoneNumber`
  </APIField>

  <APIField name="applicationId" type="UUID" optional>
    An application Id. If this is not provided and there are multiple tenants, the <InlineField>X-FusionAuth-TenantId</InlineField> header is required.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="state" type="Object" optional>
    An optional object that will be returned un-modified when you complete verification. This may be useful to return the User to particular state once verification is completed.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="verificationStrategy" type="String" optional defaults="tenant value">
    The strategy to use when verifying the User. Can be one of the following:

    * `ClickableLink` - send the User a code with a clickable link.
    * `FormField` - send the User a short code intended to be manually entered into a form field

    The default, when `loginIdType` is `email`, is <InlineField>tenant.emailConfiguration.verificationStrategy</InlineField>. When `loginIdType` is `phoneNumber`, the default is <InlineField>tenant.phoneConfiguration.verificationStrategy</InlineField>.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

### Response

<StandardPostResponseCodes never_search_error />

#### Response Body

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="verificationId" type="String">
    The verification Id that was generated by this API request. This identifier should be used by the [Complete Identity Verification](#complete-identity-verification) API and may be used by the [Send Identity Verification](#send-identity-verification) API.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="oneTimeCode" type="String" optional>
    The verification One Time Code is used with the gated Email or Phone Verification workflow. The User enters this code to verify their email or phone number when the `ClickableLink` strategy is not in use.

    <Aside>
      This is only returned if the effective verification strategy is `FormField`, which is determined by the tenant configuration or the <InlineField>verificationStrategy</InlineField> field, if it was used in the request.
    </Aside>
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

## Send Identity Verification

This API allows you to send a verification code, previously generated by the [Start Identity Verification API](#start-identity-verification), to a User via email or SMS. This is typically used to notify the User that they need to verify their identity.

If the `verificationId` was generated for:
* an email identity - the message will be sent via email using the tenant's SMTP settings and <InlineField>tenant.emailConfiguration.verificationEmailTemplateId</InlineField>
* a phone number identity - the message will be sent via SMS using <InlineField>tenant.phoneConfiguration.verificationTemplateId</InlineField> and <InlineField>tenant.phoneConfiguration.messengerId</InlineField>

### Request

<API method="POST" uri="/api/identity/verify/send" authentication={["api-key"]}
     title="Send identity verification" />

<XFusionauthTenantIdHeaderScopedOperation />

#### Request Body

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="verificationId" type="String" required>
    The verification Id that was generated by the start API.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

### Response

This API does not return a JSON response body.

<StandardPostResponseCodes never_search_error />

## Complete Identity Verification

This API allows you to complete the identity verification process by providing the verification code sent to the User. If the code is valid, the User's identity will be verified and <InlineField>user.identities\[x].verifiedReason</InlineField> will be set to `Completed`.

### Request

<API method="POST" uri="/api/identity/verify/complete" authentication={["api-key"]}
     title="Complete identity verification" />

<XFusionauthTenantIdHeaderScopedOperation />

#### Request Body

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="verificationId" type="String" required>
    The verification Id generated by the [Start Identity Verification API](#start-identity-verification), used to verify the User's identity is valid by ensuring they have access to the provided email address or phone number.

    When using the `FormField` strategy for verification, this value is used along with the `oneTimeCode` as a pair to perform verification.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="oneTimeCode" type="String" optional>
    The short code used to verify the User's account is valid by ensuring they have access to the provided email address or phone number. This field is required when the verification strategy is `FormField`.
  </APIField>

</APIBlock>

### Response

<StandardPostResponseCodes never_search_error />

#### Response Body

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="state" type="Object">
    If <InlineField>state</InlineField> was provided during the [Start Identity Verification API](#start-identity-verification) request, this value will be returned exactly as it was provided.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>
