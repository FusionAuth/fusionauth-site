<Aside type="caution">
This API underwent breaking changes in version 1.26.

If you are using a version of FusionAuth prior to 1.26.0, you should upgrade. ðŸ˜Ž &nbsp; But if you cannot - here is the doc you are looking for: [old Two Factor doc](/docs/archive/apis/two-factor-1-25).
</Aside>

## Overview

This API allows you to manage multi-factor authentication (MFA) for users.

<Aside type="note">
  <DifferenceTwoFactorMultiFactor />
</Aside>

## Authentication

Some of these operations can use JWT authentication instead of API key authentication. In some cases, when you have a valid <InlineField>twoFactorId</InlineField>, neither a JWT nor an API key is required.

Learn more about [JWT authentication and see examples here](/docs/apis/authentication#jwt-authentication).

## TOTP Implementation

Support for Authy, Google Authenticator and other time based one-time password solutions are not premium features and are included in the Community plan.

<TwoFactorTotpLimits />

## Enable Multi-Factor

This API is used to enable Multi-Factor authentication for a single User. To use this API the User must provide a valid
Multi-Factor verification code.

If using message based delivery, you may <ScrollRef target="Send a Multi-Factor Code When Enabling MFA" /> to deliver a
code to the User. The User will then provide this code as input.

### Request

#### Request Parameters

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="userId" type="UUID" required>
    The Id of the User for whom to enable Multi-Factor authentication.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

## Disable Multi-Factor

This API is used to disable Multi-Factor authentication for a single User. To use this API the User must provide a valid
Multi-Factor verification code or recovery code.

If using message based delivery, you may <ScrollRef target="Send a Multi-Factor Code When Disabling MFA" /> to deliver a
code to the User. The User will then provide this code as input.

If a recovery code is provided, all methods will be removed.

## Generate a Secret

This API is used to generate a new multi-factor secret for use when enabling multi-factor authentication for a User. This is provided
as a helper to assist you in enabling multi-factor authentication.

If this secret will be used with a QR code to allow the User to scan the value, use the Base32 encoded value returned in the response.

### Request

<API method="GET" uri="/api/two-factor/secret" authentication={["api-key"]} title="Generate a multi-factor Secret"/>

<API method="GET" uri="/api/two-factor/secret" authentication={["jwt"]} title="Generate a multi-factor Secret"/>

### Response

The response for this API contains a Multi-Factor secret suitable for an authenticator like Google Authenticator.

<StandardGetResponseCodes never_missing no_errors />

#### Response Body

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="secret" type="String">
    A Base64 encoded secret that may be used to enable Multi-Factor authentication.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="secretBase32Encoded" type="String">
    A Base32 encoded form of the provided secret. This is useful if you need to provide a QR code to the User to enable Multi-Factor authentication.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

<JSON title="Example Response JSON" src="two-factor/secret/response.json" />

## Start Multi-Factor

Starts an multi-factor request. This would be used for only step up auth, such as when sensitive data is requested.

If you want to provide your own code and/or deliver the code out of band using your own delivery mechanism, this is the right API call. Do not combine this with a <ScrollRef target="Send a Multi-Factor Code During Login or Step Up" /> call, as calling that API will invalidate all other codes associated with the <InlineField>twoFactorId</InlineField>, including any you provide.

To require additional factors during login, <ScrollRef target="Enable Multi-Factor" /> for the User. Then FusionAuth will handle MFA code collection automatically, if you are using the hosted login pages, or send a status code in response to the login API if you are not.

### Request

<API method="POST" uri="/api/two-factor/start" authentication={["api-key"]} title="Start multi-factor authentication"/>

<XFusionauthTenantIdHeaderScopedOperation />

<TwoFactorStartRequestBody />

### Response

<StandardPostResponseCodes missing_message="The User does not exist. The response will be empty." />

<TwoFactorStartResponseBody />

## Retrieve Multi-Factor Status

Retrieves a user's multi-factor status. This is helpful to understand if a user has multi-factor authentication enabled, and if the user will be required to perform a multi-factor challenge during the next login request.

This API may also be used to identify if an existing multi-factor trust value obtained during a multi-factor login is expired, or valid for a specific application when configured to restrict multi-factor trust.

### Request

<API method="GET" uri="/api/two-factor/status/{twoFactorTrustId}" authentication={["api-key"]} title="Retrieve multi-factor status"/>

<XFusionauthTenantIdHeaderScopedOperation />

#### Request Parameters

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="applicationId" type="String" optional>
    A unique application Id. When Application multi-factor configuration is enabled, providing this parameter will ensure the returned status applies to the expected result when attempting to login into this application.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="twoFactorTrustId" type="String" optional>
    The existing multi-factor trust obtained by completing a multi-factor login. This is the value that allows you to bypass multi-factor during the next login attempt.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="userId" type="String" required>
    The unique Id of the user for which to retrieve multi-factor status.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

| 200  | The user does not have multi-factor enabled, or the provided trust is still valid for the next login.                                                                                                                                                |
| 242  | The user has multi-factor authentication enabled. Since version `1.42.0`, this status code is also returned when two factor authentication is required.  The user will be required to complete a two-factor challenge during the next login attempt. |
| 400  | The request was invalid and/or malformed. The response will contain an [Errors](/docs/apis/errors) JSON Object with the specific errors.                                                                                                             |
| 401  | You did not supply a valid Authorization header. The header was omitted or your API key was not valid. The response will be empty. See [Authentication](/docs/apis/authentication).                                                                  |
| 500  | There was an internal error. A stack trace is provided and logged in the FusionAuth log files. The response will be empty.                                                                                                                           |


#### Response Body

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="trusts" type="Array">
    An array of one or more trust configurations.

</APIBlock>

<JSON title="Example Response JSON" src="two-factor/status/response.json" />

## Send a Multi-Factor Code During Login or Step Up

This operation allows you to send a message with a code to finish a Multi-Factor flow, and requires an existing <InlineField>twoFactorId</InlineField>. No API key is required.

This should only be used if you want FusionAuth to send the code. Do not use this if you are sending a code out of band or are using a TOTP based authentication method.

You can use this to re-send a code with the same or a different method. Using this API will invalidate all other codes previously associated with the provided <InlineField>twoFactorId</InlineField>.

Sending a code invalidates all previous codes for the provided `twoFactorId`.

### Request

<API method="POST" uri="/api/two-factor/send/{twoFactorId}" authentication={["none"]} title="Send a multi-factor code to complete Multi-Factor Login"/>

#### Request Parameters

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="twoFactorId" type="String" required>
    The <InlineField>twoFactorId</InlineField> returned by the Login API or the Start multi-factor request.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>
