    Indicates if a JWT may be refreshed using a Refresh Token for this application. This configuration is separate from issuing new Refresh Tokens which is controlled by the `generateRefreshTokens` parameter. This configuration indicates specifically if an existing Refresh Token may be used to request a new JWT using the [Refresh API](/docs/apis/jwt#refresh-a-jwt).

    If you do not intend to use the Login API, and instead will only be using the OAuth endpoints, you may leave this set to `false` to ensure Refresh Tokens cannot be used outside of the Refresh Token Grant.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="application.loginConfiguration.generateRefreshTokens" type="Boolean" optional since="1.5.0">
    Indicates if a Refresh Token should be issued from the Login API.

    When configured, this value overrides the value configured by the <InlineField>tenant.multiFactorConfiguration.loginPolicy</InlineField>.

    Supported values include:

    * `Enabled` - Require a two-factor challenge during login when an eligible method is available.
    * `Disabled` - Do not require a two-factor challenge during login.

    When <InlineField>application.multiFactorConfiguration.loginPolicy</InlineField> is set to `Enabled` or `Required`, this trust policy is utilized when determining if a user must complete a two-factor challenge during login.

    For example, a normal two-factor login flow will result in a trust Id being returned if you set <InlineField>trustComputer</InlineField> equal to `true` when completing a Two Factor Login. The returned Trust identifier can be used on subsequent Login requests to keep from being required to complete a Two-Factor login. This configuration determines if that trust value can be utilized for another application.

    Supported values include:

    * `Any` - Trust obtained from any application is sufficient to bypass the two-factor challenge.
    * `This` - Only trust obtained for this application is sufficient to bypass the two-factor challenge.
    * `None` - Never trusted. The user will be required to complete a two-factor challenge during each login attempt.

  <APIField name="application.oauthConfiguration.authorizedOriginURLs" type="Array<String>" optional>
    An array of URLs that are the authorized origins for FusionAuth OAuth.

    For improved security, all FusionAuth hosted login pages add an HTTP response header of `X-Frame-Options: DENY`. This response header disallows loading the FusionAuth pages from an iframe. To utilize an iframe and load one or more of the FusionAuth hosted login pages, add the iframe page URLs to this property. For that host, FusionAuth will remove the `X-Frame-Options` header allowing the page to load in the iframe.

    Examples of valid authorized origin URIs:

     * https://example.com
     * com.myApp://example
     * com.myApp:/example

    <span class="text-green-600">Available since 1.32.0</span>

    You may now use URLs that do not begin with `http` to support native application origins. Prior to this version the value will be validated to begin with `http`. This also includes authorized origins that use a single slash to denote there is no naming authority for the scheme. Prior to this version a URL such as `com.myApp:/example` would fail validation as an invalid URL.

    <OauthWildcardUsage validation_policy_field_name="application.oauthConfiguration.authorizedURLValidationPolicy" validation_policy_wildcard="AllowWildcards" />
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="application.oauthConfiguration.authorizedRedirectURLs" type="Array<String>" optional>

     * com.myApp://redirect
     * com.myApp:/redirect

    <span class="text-green-600">Available since 1.7.0</span>

    You may now use URLs that do not begin with `http` to support native application redirect. Prior to this version the value will be validated to begin with `http`.

    <span class="text-green-600">Available since 1.12.0</span>

    You may now use URLs for application redirects that use a single slash to denote there is no naming authority for the scheme. Prior to this version a URL such as `com.myApp:/redirect` would fail validation as in invalid URL.

  </APIField>
  <APIField name="application.oauthConfiguration.consentMode" type="String" optional since="1.50.0" defaults="AlwaysPrompt">

    One or more authorized URLS that may be specified by the SAML v2 Service Provider in the Authentication request `[AssertionConsumerServiceURL]` element. If a requested URL is not in this list the request will be rejected by FusionAuth.

    This is the URL that FusionAuth will send the SAML response during a SAML login request, this URL is also referred to as the Assertion Consumer Service or ACS). If the Authentication request does not contain the `[AssertionConsumerServiceURL]` element, the first URL found in this list will be used to send the SAML response back to the Service Provider.

    The URL that the browser is taken to after the user logs out of the SAML service provider. Often service providers need this URL in order to correctly hook up single-logout.

    This is also the URL that will be sent the SAML v2 LogoutResponse using the same bindings that were used to initiate the logout request with the IdP. For example, if POST bindings were used to initiate the logout request, POST bindings will be used for this LogoutResponse request.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="application.samlv2Configuration.requireSignedRequests" type="Boolean" optional since="1.20.0">

    The possible values are:

     * `Assertion` - The XML signature will be added as a child element of the Assertion.
     * `Response` - The XML signature will be added as a child element of the Response.

    In most cases the default configuration will be adequate. If you encounter a SAML v2 Service Provider that requires the signature to be a child of the Response, use this configuration to change the signature location. Prior to version `1.21.0`, the XML signature was always located as a child element of the Assertion when the response was successful.
