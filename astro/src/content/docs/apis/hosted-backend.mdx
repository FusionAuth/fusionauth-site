## Overview

<Aside type="version">
This API has been available since 1.45.0
</Aside>

The hosted backend APIs provide a pre-built solution for getting your app up and running using the OAuth2 Authorization Code grant with PKCE. We have in the past shown you how to [create these endpoints yourself](/blog/2021/11/11/how-to-authenticate-your-react-app#create-the-express-server) but this solution allows you to get going with your app without writing any backend code. You just need FusionAuth!

## Prerequisites

Be sure to review the [Applications](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/applications#oauth) section of the FusionAuth user guide to ensure proper configuration before using the hosted endpoints.

The hosted backend endpoints will set the following cookies, which are `Secure` and have a `SameSite` value of `Lax`. This follows our [expert advice on client-side storage](/learn/expert-advice/oauth/oauth-token-storage#client-side-storage).

When you are making requests against these endpoints from your JavaScript application, ensure that you are sending cookies as well. The exact syntax varies, but for many frameworks, you must set `withCredentials` to `true` when you make the request.

_Cookies Set By the Hosted Backend_

| Name       | HttpOnly | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| app.at     | true     | The access token for the configured application. This is a JWT and can be presented to your APIs to access data and functionality.                                                              |
| app.rt     | true     | The refresh token for the configured application. Only present if the `offline_access` scope is requested. This can be presented to FusionAuth to retrieve a new access token.                  |
| app.idt    | false    | The Id token for the user for the configured application. Only present if the `openid` scope is requested. This is a JWT and can be accessed by JavaScript to display user account information. |
| app.at_exp | false    | The UNIX epoch timestamp indicating when the access token will expire. This can be checked by JavaScript to determine when a refresh token should be used to get a new access token.            |

FusionAuth will set the domain on these cookies to `.example.com` where `example` is the domain name that FusionAuth is serving from either from the domain or any subdomain, `com` is the top-level domain, and the `.` allows the cookie to match the domain and all subdomains. If the host is a simple host name or IP address FusionAuth will set the domain to that (i.e. `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`). If FusionAuth is on a nested domain, then it will set cookies on the broadest domain that is not a top-level domain.

What this means is that FusionAuth needs to be hosted on the same domain or a subdomain or sibling domain of the application that you intend to use with these endpoints.

<Aside type="caution">
  <HostedBackendWarning />
</Aside>

For example if your app is on `app.example.com` and FusionAuth is on `auth.example.com` the cookies would be usable by your application. If FusionAuth is on `auth.department.division.example.com` and the app lives on `app.otherdepartment.otherdivision.example.com`, the cookies would still be usable, since the cookies are set on the `example.com` domain.

## Login

This API will start an OAuth2 Authorization Code grant by building a valid request and then redirecting the browser to our `/oauth2/authorize` endpoint. If the user is not logged in the user will be presented with the login page and prompted for credentials before being redirected back to the [Callback](#callback) endpoint.

To use this API, redirect the browser to this route. This is not meant to be called by non-browser clients.

### Request

<API method="GET" uri="/app/login/{clientId}?redirect_uri={redirectUri}&state={state}&scope={scope}" authentication={["none"]} title="Start the login flow"/>

#### Request Parameters

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="clientId" type="UUID" required>
    The client Id for your Application.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="redirect_uri" type="String" optional>
    The URL encoded URL that the browser will be redirected to at the end of the login flow. If provided, this URL must be included in the <InlineField>Authorized Redirect URLs</InlineField> array for your application. If not provided, the default will be the first value in the <InlineField>Authorized Redirect URLs</InlineField> array configured for your application. This parameter is validated the same as if it were being passed to `/oauth2/authorize`, however when using this endpoint FusionAuth will pass [Callback](#callback) as the <InlineField>redirect_uri</InlineField> to `/oauth2/authorize` as that route will handle the token exchange.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="state" type="String" optional>
    The value of this parameter will be echoed back in the <InlineField>state</InlineField> parameter of the redirect URL at the end of the login flow.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="scope" type="String" optional defaults="openid offline_access">
    The OAuth2 <InlineField>scope</InlineField> parameter to be passed to the `/oauth2/authorize` endpoint. The format is a URL encoded, space-separated list of scopes (i.e `openid+offline_access` or `openid%20offline_access`).

    Available scopes:

    * `openid` - This scope is used to request the `app.idt` Id token cookie be returned in the response
    * `offline_access` - This scope is used to request the `app.rt` refresh token cookie be returned in the response
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

Example Request URL
```
https://auth.example.com/app/login/297ca84b-69a9-4508-8649-97644e1d0b3d?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.example.com%2Fcallback&state=yourStateData&scope=offline_access
```

### Response

Successful invocations of this route will return a  `302` redirect to `/oauth2/authorize`. Other status codes indicate an error.

_Response Codes_

| Code | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 200  | There was an error. The route will serve up an error page with HTML and details on what went wrong.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 302  | A successful request will redirect the user to `/oauth2/authorize` to log in.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 403  | A forbidden response typically means that the Origin of this request did not pass the FusionAuth CORS filter. Add your app origin to your [CORS Configuration](/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/cors) as an <InlineField>Allowed Origin</InlineField>. |
| 500  | There was a FusionAuth internal error. A stack trace is provided and logged in the FusionAuth log files.                                                                                                                                               |

## Register

This API will start a registration flow by building a valid request and then redirecting the browser to our `/oauth2/register` endpoint. This endpoint is nearly identical to the [Login](#login) endpoint; however the end result is user registration instead of a login. If the user is not logged in the user will be presented with the registration page and prompted for credentials before being redirected back to the [Callback](#callback) endpoint. If the user is logged in they will be redirected to `/oauth2/authorize` and subsequently to the [Callback](#callback) endpoint.

[Self-service Registration](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/applications#registration) will need to be enabled otherwise this endpoint will redirect to [Login](#login).

To use this API, redirect the browser to this route. This is not meant to be called by non-browser clients.

### Request

<API method="GET" uri="/app/register/{clientId}?redirect_uri={redirectUri}&state={state}&scope={scope}" authentication={["none"]} title="Start the registration flow"/>

#### Request Parameters

## Callback

<Aside type="note">
You do not need to call this endpoint directly. The browser will be redirected here automatically after a successful login or registration. This is the route that handles the token exchange and sets the cookies on the browser and will redirect the browser to the defined `redirect_uri`.

This endpoint is documented for educational purposes only.
