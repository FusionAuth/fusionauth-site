## Authenticate a User

The Login API is used authenticate a user in FusionAuth. The issuer of the One Time Password will dictate if a JWT or a Refresh Token may be issued in the API response.

### Request

By default, this API will require API key authentication when called with an <InlineField>applicationId</InlineField>. API key authentication may be disabled per Application, see <InlineField>application.loginConfiguration.requireAuthentication</InlineField> in the [Application API](/docs/apis/applications) or navigate to <Breadcrumb>Applications -> Edit -> Security</Breadcrumb> in the user interface.

Prior to version `1.5.0` this API did not accept an API key and never required authentication.

<API method="POST" uri="/api/login" authentication={['none', 'api-key']} title="Authenticate a User"/>

#### Request Headers

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="X-Forwarded-For" type="String" optional>
    The IP address of a client requesting authentication. If the IP address is provided it will be stored for login history of the user. It is
    generally preferred to specify the IP address in the request body. If it is not provided in the request body this header value will be used
    if available, the request body value will take precedence.
  </APIField>
  <XFusionauthTenantIdHeaderScopedOperationRowOnly />
</APIBlock>

#### Request Cookies

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="fusionauth.trust" type="String" optional>
    The Multi-Factor Trust identifier returned by the Multi-Factor Login API response. This value may be provided to bypass the Multi-Factor challenge when a User has Multi-Factor enabled. When this cookie exists on the request it will take precedence over the <InlineField>twoFactorTrustId</InlineField> if provided in the request body.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

#### Request Body

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="applicationId" type="UUID" optional>
  <LoginApplicationidParameter />
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="ipAddress" type="String" optional>
    The IP address of the end-user that is logging into FusionAuth. If this value is omitted FusionAuth will attempt to obtain the IP address of
    the client, the value will be that of the `X-Forwarded-For` header if provided or the last proxy that sent the request. The IP address will
    be stored in the User login history.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="loginId" type="String" required>
    The login identifier of the user. The login identifier can be either the <InlineField>email</InlineField> or the <InlineField>username</InlineField>.

    **Note:**
    The value will be used exactly as provided to resolve a user by <InlineField>email</InlineField> or the <InlineField>username</InlineField>. If the provided value contains leading or trailing white space these characters will not be removed, and then would only match a user by <InlineField>email</InlineField> or the <InlineField>username</InlineField> if the values stored in FusionAuth also contain these same leading or trailing spaces.

    You may optionally normalize this value prior to sending it to FusionAuth. If you are using a hosted login page, FusionAuth will use this API to complete login during an OAuth2 or SAML v2 workflow. In this case, you may optionally normalize or validate the user input client side using JavaScript or HTML 5 validation to achieve the same result.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

<LoginMetadataDevice />

  <APIField name="noJWT" type="Boolean" optional defaults="false">
    When this value is set to true a JWT will not be issued as part of this request. The response body will not contain the `token` or `refreshToken` fields, and the `access_token` and `refresh_token` cookies will not be written to the HTTP response.

    This optional parameter may be helpful when performing high volume authentication requests and the JWT is not being utilized, in this scenario removing the additional latency required to issue and sign the JWT may have a measurable cumulative effect on performance.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="password" type="String" required>
    The user's password or an Application specific [Authentication Token](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/application-authentication-tokens).
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="twoFactorTrustId" type="String" optional>
    The Multi-Factor Trust identifier returned by the Multi-Factor Login API response. This value may be provided to bypass the Multi-Factor challenge when a User has Multi-Factor enabled.
  </APIField>
<JSON title="Example Request JSON" src="login/request.json" />

### Response

The response for this API contains the User object.

<LoginResponseCodesAuthenticated />

<UserResponseBody login_response />

#### Response Cookies

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="access_token" type="String">
    The encoded access token. This cookie is written in the response as an HTTP Only session cookie.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="refresh_token" type="String">
    The refresh token. This cookie is written in the response as an HTTP only persistent cookie. The cookie expiration is configured in the JWT
    configuration for the application or the global JWT configuration.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

## Authenticate a User with a one time password

This API is used to login using a One Time Password that has been returned from the Change Password API. The login request is nearly identical, however the `oneTimePasswordId` will take the place of both the `loginId` and the `password` properties.

### Request

By default, this API will require authentication when called with an <InlineField>applicationId</InlineField>. Authentication may be disabled per Application, see <InlineField>application.loginConfiguration.requireAuthentication</InlineField> in the [Application API](/docs/apis/applications) or navigate to <Breadcrumb>Applications -> Edit -> Security</Breadcrumb> in the user interface.

    will be stored in the User login history.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

<LoginMetadataDevice />

  <APIField name="noJWT" type="Boolean" optional defaults="false">
    When this value is set to true a JWT will not be issued as part of this request. The response body will not contain the `token` field,
    and the `access_token` and `refresh_token` cookies will not be written to the HTTP response.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="trustComputer" type="Boolean" optional defaults="false">

    allow the Multi-Factor challenge to be bypassed.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="twoFactorId" type="String" required>
    An Id generated and returned in the response body during the initial authentication attempt.

    The default duration of this identifier is 5 minutes. This means that you have 5 minutes to complete the request to this API after calling the Login API. Once the identifier has expired you will need to call the Login API again to restart the process.

    This duration can be modified using the Tenant API or in the FusionAuth UI.

#### Response Cookies

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="access_token" type="String">
    The encoded access token. This cookie is written in the response as an HTTP Only session cookie.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="refresh_token" type="String">
    The refresh token. This cookie is written in the response as an HTTP Only persistent cookie. The cookie expiration is configured in the
    JWT configuration for the application or the global JWT configuration.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="fusionauth.trust" type="String">
    The Multi-Factor Trust identifier. This value is returned when `trustComputer` was set to `true` on the request. This value can be used by

## Update Login Instant

Sends a ping to FusionAuth indicating that the user has authenticated, and (optionally) automatically logged into an application.
When using FusionAuth's SSO or your own, you should call this if the user is already logged in centrally, but accesses an
application where they no longer have a session. This helps correctly track login counts, times and helps with reporting.

### Request

<API method="PUT" uri="/api/login/{userId}/{applicationId}?ipAddress={ipAddress}" authentication={["api-key"]} title="Update the login instant for a given User and Application"/>

#### Request Headers

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="X-Forwarded-For" type="String" optional>
    The IP address of a client requesting authentication. If the IP address is provided it will be stored for login history of the user. It is
    generally preferred to specify the IP address in the request body. If it is not provided in the request body this header value will be used
    if available, the request body value will take precedence.
  </APIField>
  <XFusionauthTenantIdHeaderScopedOperationRowOnly />
</APIBlock>

#### Request Parameters


<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="userId" type="UUID" required>
    The Id of the user logging in.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="applicationId" type="UUID" optional>

  <LoginApplicationidParameter />
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="ipAddress" type="String" optional>
    The IP address of the end-user that is logging into FusionAuth. If this value is omitted FusionAuth will attempt to obtain the IP address of
    the client, the value will be that of the `X-Forwarded-For` header if provided or the last proxy that sent the request. The IP address will
    be stored in the User login history.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>


<API method="PUT" uri="/api/login?ipAddress={ipAddress}" authentication={["jwt"]} title="Update the login instant for a given User and Application using a JWT"/>

The `userId` is not required on the request. The `userId` and `applicationId` values will be retrieved from the identity claims in the JWT payload.

#### Request Parameters

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="ipAddress" type="String" optional>
    The IP address of the end-user that is logging into FusionAuth. If this value is omitted FusionAuth will attempt to obtain the IP address of
    the client, the value will be that of the `X-Forwarded-For` header if provided or the last proxy that sent the request. The IP address will
    be stored in the User login history.
  </APIField>

## Logout a User

The Logout API is intended to be used to remove the refresh token and access token cookies if they exist on the client and revoke the refresh token. This
API does nothing if the request does not contain an access token or refresh token cookies.

The refresh token is only revoked if the request contains the `refresh_token` cookie or the `refreshToken` request parameter. 

This does not revoke the FusionAuth SSO session. Use [`/oauth2/logout`](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/endpoints#logout) to do so.

### Request

<API method="POST" uri="/api/logout" authentication={["none"]} title="Remove the access_token and refresh_token cookies if they exist on the client."/>

#### Request Cookies

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="access_token" type="String" optional>
    The access token cookie. When this cookie available in the request it will be deleted from the client.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="refresh_token" type="String" optional>
    The refresh token cookie. When this cookie available in the request it will be deleted from the client and revoked in FusionAuth.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

<XFusionauthTenantIdHeaderScopedOperation />

#### Request Body

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="global" type="Boolean" optional defaults="false">
    When this value is set to true all of the refresh tokens issued to the owner of the provided refresh token will be revoked. If no refresh token is provided on the request no refresh tokens will be revoked.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="refreshToken" type="String" optional>
    The `refresh_token` as a request parameter instead of coming in via a cookie. If provided this takes precedence over the cookie.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

### Response

This API does not return a JSON response body.
