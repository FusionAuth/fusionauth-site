## Overview
Entities are arbitrary objects which can be modeled in FusionAuth. Anything which is not a user but might need permissions managed by FusionAuth is a possible entity. Examples might include devices, cars, computers, customers, companies, etc.

FusionAuth's Entity Management has the following major concepts:

* Entity Types categorize Entities. An Entity Type could be `Device`, `API` or `Company`.
* Permissions are defined on an Entity Type. These are arbitrary strings which can fit the business domain. A Permission could be `read`, `write`, or `file-lawsuit`.
* Entities are instances of a single type. An Entity could be a `nest device`, an `Email API` or `Raviga`.
* Entities can have Grants. Grants are relationships between a target Entity and one of two other types: a recipient Entity or a User. Grants can have zero or more Permissions associated with them.

You can use the Client Credentials grant to see if an Entity has permission to access another Entity.

You can learn more about [Entities in the Core Concepts section](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/entity-management).

The following APIs are available.

* [Entities](/docs/apis/entities/entities)
* [Entity Types](/docs/apis/entities/entity-types)
* [Grants](/docs/apis/entities/grants)
