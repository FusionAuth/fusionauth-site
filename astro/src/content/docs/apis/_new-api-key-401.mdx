FusionAuth caches API keys for a faster lookup. There is an internal distributed cache and notification policy for multi-node deployments. When you create a new key, it will take time for the API key to be usable. Usually this less than one second. In rare cases where node communication fails, it may take up to 60 seconds.

This means that if you create a new API key using the [API Key API](/docs/apis/api-keys#create-an-api-key) and use it immediately, you may receive a 401 status code. This typically indicates you didn't supply a valid API key, but in this case means that the new key is not yet usable.

The workaround to wait for a period, using exponential backoff and then retry the request.
