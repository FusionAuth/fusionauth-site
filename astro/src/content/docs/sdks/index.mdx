## Overview

Client libraries and SDKs will help you quickly integrate your application with FusionAuth. All of our client libraries are open source and hosted on our [GitHub account](https://github.com/FusionAuth). You can fork and tweak them as well as look over the code to learn how the client libraries work.

## SDKs vs Client Libraries

At FusionAuth, a **client library** is a thin wrapper over our FusionAuth APIs, and it provides complete coverage over all public FusionAuth API endpoints. A client library is like a set of legos, to be put together by a developer who wants to extend or manipulate FusionAuth to meet their needs.

You can use a client library to manage FusionAuth. For instance, if you wanted to rotate client secrets regularly, you could use a client library to do so.

It can also be used to integrate with a custom application to offer login experiences that are different from those that are offered out of the box. If, in your app, you wanted to prompt someone for a username first, then do a lookup, then offer them a custom password field, then prompt them to enter their favorite color, use a client library to perform these complicated, custom operations.

At FusionAuth, an **SDK** is an opinionated set of higher level constructs. These focus on a subset of functionality. These are like an assembled lego set.

These let you quickly accomplish the common tasks and are often targeted at developers working on the front end: mobile/React/Vue/Angular/JavaScript developers. 

FusionAuth SDKs have:

* A button/function for logging in
* A button/function for logging out
* A button/function to register the user
* A filter/some way to examine roles and limit information displayed to a given role or set of roles
* A way to refresh a token without asking the user to reauthenticate.
* Secure access and refresh token storage

SDKs should require minimal customization to use.

If you want both the easy solutions provided by an SDK and the fine-grained control provided by a client library, you can use an SDK and a client library in the same application.

## Languages

If we are missing a language, open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues) as a Feature Request if you don't see it already listed as an open feature.

* [Angular SDK](/docs/sdks/angular-sdk) 
* [Dart Client Library](/docs/sdks/dart)
* [Go Client Library](/docs/sdks/go)
* [Java Client Library](/docs/sdks/java)
* [.NET Core Client Library](/docs/sdks/netcore)
* [OpenAPI Client Library](/docs/sdks/openapi)
* [PHP Client Library](/docs/sdks/php)
* [Python Client Library](/docs/sdks/python)
* [React SDK](/docs/sdks/react-sdk) 
* [Ruby Client Library](/docs/sdks/ruby)
* [Typescript Client Library](/docs/sdks/typescript)
* [Vue SDK](/docs/sdks/vue-sdk) 

There are also [community contributed client libraries for other languages](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-contrib/blob/master/client-libraries.md).

### Deprecated Client Libraries

These client libraries still work and are built for every release, but are deprecated. For new projects, prefer the alternative.

* [JavaScript Client Library](/docs/sdks/javascript) (deprecated, prefer [Typescript Client Library](/docs/sdks/typescript))
* [Node Client Library](/docs/sdks/node) (deprecated, prefer [Typescript Client Library](/docs/sdks/typescript))

## Maintenance Policy

As Client Libraries and SDKs use other packages and language runtimes to actually run the code, they have a strong coupling on the release process of these external tools.

Our Client Libraries and SDKs will be updated to newer versions of those libraries and language runtimes every 6 months, which will be the only one actively maintained. The previous version will enter a **deprecated state** and only receive critical bug fixes and security issues for the next cycle of 6 months, and we'll sunset any version older than that.

If we decide to deprecate an entire Client Library and/or SDK, it will also only receive critical bug fixes and security issues for 6 months, until it finally reaches end-of-support, with no releases and updates anymore. Users may still use deprecated libraries at their own discretion via public package managers and/or GitHub repositories, which may be archived.
