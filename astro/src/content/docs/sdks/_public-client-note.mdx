You may use this client library in an application that cannot securely store secrets, such as a native mobile application or a single page application running in the browser. 

In this scenario, you should disable <InlineField>Require authentication</InlineField> in the FusionAuth Application configuration and use [PKCE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636) to secure communication with the Token endpoint.

You can use the `exchangeOAuthCodeForAccessTokenUsingPKCE` client method to do so.
