## Overview

FusionAuth configuration is managed in a number of ways, depending on the item being configured. The majority of application level settings are managed in the UI or the APIs. 

Other items such as memory, ports, and other system configuration options are managed through a lookup process. 

This process uses environment variables, Java system properties, and the key value pairs in the `fusionauth.properties` file.

## Lookup Process

Available Since Version 1.19.0.

The lookup process was introduced in version [`1.19.0`](/docs/release-notes/archive#version-1-19-0) and allows any configuration option to be specified in one of three ways: environment variables, Java system properties, or in the `fusionauth.properties` configuration file. Here is the process for looking up configuration options (NOTE: that the name of the configuration options are listed below):

1. Check if an environment variable is defined with the configuration option name
2. Check if an environment variable is defined with the configuration option name translated by upper-casing it and replacing periods and dashes with underscores
3. Check if there is a Java system property with the configuration option name
4. Check if the configuration option is defined in the `fusionauth.properties` configuration file

To better illustrate how the lookup works, let's take one of the common configuration options for FusionAuth and walk through each step. We'll use `database.url` which defines the JDBC URL where the database is located. Here's how the lookup will work:

1. Check for an environment variable named `database.url`
2. Check for an environment variable named `DATABASE_URL`
3. Check for a Java System property defined like this: `-Ddatabase.url=foo`
4. Check if there is a line in `fusionauth.properties` like this: `database.url=foo`

This lookup order is consistent for every configuration option listed below.

## Configuration File

Assuming you installed in the default locations, the configuration file may be found in the following directory. If you have installed in an alternate location the path to this file will be different.

```plaintext title="Linux and macOS"
/usr/local/fusionauth/config/fusionauth.properties
```

```plaintext title="Windows"
\fusionauth\config\fusionauth.properties
```
