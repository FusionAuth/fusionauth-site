## Overview

Cookies are a critical part of web applications.

When you call certain APIs, such as the Login API, cookies may be set. Such cookies are specified in the [API documentation](/docs/apis/).

When you use the [hosted login pages](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/integration-points#hosted-login-pages), FusionAuth uses cookies to enable functionality.

## Domains

The domain of all cookies is the domain on which the FusionAuth instance is running. You can control the domain FusionAuth uses by [setting up a proxy](/docs/operate/deploy/proxy-setup).

In other words, if FusionAuth serves requests at `auth.piedpiper.com`, it will only set cookies for this value: `auth.piedpiper.com`. It will never set cookies for `.piedpiper.com`. The ability to control the domain of the cookie set is an [open feature request](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1991).
