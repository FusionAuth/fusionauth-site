## Overview

Cookies are a critical part of web applications.

When you call certain APIs, such as the Login API, cookies may be set. Such cookies are specified in the [API documentation](/docs/apis/).

When you use the [hosted login pages](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/integration-points#hosted-login-pages), the [hosted backend](/docs/apis/hosted-backend) or [interact with the APIs](/docs/apis/), FusionAuth uses cookies to enable functionality.

## Domains

The domain of all cookies is the domain on which the FusionAuth instance is running. You can control the domain FusionAuth uses by [setting up a proxy](/docs/operate/deploy/proxy-setup).

In other words, if FusionAuth serves requests at `auth.piedpiper.com`, it will only set cookies for this value: `auth.piedpiper.com`. It will never set cookies for `.piedpiper.com`. The ability to control the domain of the cookie set is an [open feature request](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1991).

Additionally, most cookies set by FusionAuth will use the [SameSite](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#samesitesamesite-value) value of `Strict` or `Lax`. This is to protect against [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf). Practically, it means a browser will block those cookies on a cross-site request unless the browser is navigating to the origin site from an external site, which is something to consider if you intend to access FusionAuth from a different domain using something like an IFRAME.
