## GDPR Compliance in FusionAuth

FusionAuth is designed with GDPR compliance in mind, incorporating essential features to protect user data and privacy. This guide outlines the key aspects of FusionAuth's GDPR compliance and how it helps your application meet regulatory requirements.

## Core Compliance Features

FusionAuth offers several built-in features that support GDPR compliance:

### Data Protection

FusionAuth employs strict server security, firewalls, and encryption to protect hosted customer data1.

### Data Isolation

As a single-tenant solution, FusionAuth ensures:

-   User data is not co-mingled with other companies
-   Data can be hosted in specific countries as required
-   Data Retrieval and Deletion

FusionAuth provides APIs for:

-   Collecting all stored user data, including custom data
-   Deleting all user data, including behavioral data like IP addresses and login timestamps

With the appropriate license, FusionAuth provides a user accessible UI for collecting and modifying all stored user data, including custom data.

### User Data Pseudonymization

FusionAuth uses opaque tokens and complex user IDs to pseudonymize user data, making it difficult to match IDs to user data without database access.

### Password Security

FusionAuth includes:

-   Customizable password rules to ensure compliance with NIST regulations
-   Configurable password hashing algorithms, including BYO algorithm
-   Ability to upgrade hashing algorithms during user login

### Breach Notification

FusionAuth maintains a strict breach notification policy, aiming to notify customers of any breach or suspected breach within 24 hours.

## Implementation Benefits

By using FusionAuth, developers can focus on their application's core functionality while ensuring GDPR compliance for user management. FusionAuth's security-first approach and continuous updates to best practices provide a robust and flexible solution for modern authentication and access management1.
