import InlineField from 'src/components/InlineField.astro';

Prior to version 1.37.0 this was a tenant or application scoped event. It can be sent to all applications or to one or more specified applications.

The ability to limit the generation of an event for only certain applications is legacy functionality and is removed as of version 1.37.0. In earlier versions, you almost certainly want to enable this event at the tenant level and optionally filter on the <InlineField>tenantId</InlineField> when consuming the event.

In version 1.37.0 and later this is a tenant scoped event. It can be sent to all tenants or to one or more specified tenants. Those tenants will only be sent events related to their tenant. You can optionally also filter on the <InlineField>applicationId</InlineField> when consuming the event.
