## Overview

Events and Webhooks are a core architecture feature of FusionAuth. This feature provides a publish-subscribe pattern to developers and integrators of FusionAuth. In this architecture pattern, the Webhook is the subscriber and FusionAuth is the publisher.

This system is designed to provide feedback to your system when events occur within FusionAuth. Events are sent via an HTTP `POST` request with a JSON request body. The request will be sent with the a `Content-Type` header of `application/json`. This is the same style of API that the FusionAuth App uses to handle API requests from your application.

Here's a brief video covering some aspects of webhooks:

See the corresponding [Webhook APIs](/docs/apis/webhooks) if you'd prefer to programatically configure FusionAuth Webhooks.

Here are the topics in this section:

* [Writing a Webhook](/docs/extend/events-and-webhooks/writing-a-webhook) - Covers how to write a Webhook that will process events from FusionAuth.
* [Securing a Webhook](/docs/extend/events-and-webhooks/securing) - Covers how to ensure your webhooks are secured properly.
* [Signing a Webhook](/docs/extend/events-and-webhooks/signing) - Covers how to sign webhook events
* [Events](/docs/extend/events-and-webhooks/events/) - Covers all of the event types that FusionAuth sends to Webhooks

Continue reading below to see how the events and webhooks are configured using the FusionAuth user interface.

## Tenant Settings

To prepare to consume FusionAuth events you'll first need to enable the event and select a transaction level that is compatible with your requirements in the tenant. 

<Aside type="note">
You do not need to configure the tenant settings for any system level webhook events, such as the `Audit Log Create` event.
</Aside>

To do so, navigate to <strong>Tenants -> Webhooks</strong> to enable events and optionally modify the default transaction level for each event type.

### Webhooks

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Webhooks">
    Enable the webhooks you wish to receive events from this tenant. All webhooks will be shown, but if the webhook is a `global` webhook then you will not be able to unselect it here. That must be done in the [Webhook Settings](/docs/extend/events-and-webhooks/#tenants)
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

### Event Settings

<TenantWebhooksTable />

### Transaction Failures

As mentioned above, if you configure your transaction settings to require one or more webhooks to succeed, success occurs if the requisite number of webhooks returns a status code between 200 and 299.

If they do not, however, the webhook transaction fails. When this occurs, any API calls you are making will receive a response with the status code `504`. 

The response will be a JSON object with more details:

```json title="Example Error Response JSON"
{
  "generalErrors": [
     {
	"code": "[WebhookTransactionException]",
	"message": "One or more webhooks returned an invalid response or were unreachable. Based on your transaction configuration, your action cannot be completed."
      }
   ]
}
```

## Add Webhook

After you have enabled the events that you will be using, create a webhook definition to indicate where FusionAuth should send the JSON events. Navigate to <strong>Settings -> Webhooks</strong> to create a new webhook.

See the example screenshot below, at a minimum you will need to provide the URL the endpoint that will accept the FusionAuth JSON events. You can see in this screenshot that even though an event may be enabled globally you can still select which events will be sent to this webhook.

If you need to configure an Authorization header or other credentials to allow FusionAuth to make a request to your webhook, you may do so in the Security tab.

    A check indicates this event is a system event and is not scoped to a tenant.
  </APIField>
  <APIField name="Enabled">
    This toggle indicates if the event is enabled and may be sent to configured webhooks. This toggle affects all webhooks, a specific webhook may still be configured to ignore this event.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

### Security

The security settings may be used to require authentication in order to submit an event to the webhook.

<img src="/img/docs/extend/events-and-webhooks/webhook-settings-security.png" alt="Webhook Settings - Security" width="1200" role="shadowed top-cropped" />

#### Form Fields

<APIBlock>

    The [Key](/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/key-master) containing an SSL certificate to be used when connecting to the webhook.

    If you need to add a certificate for use with this webhook, navigate to <strong>Settings -> Key Master</strong> and import a certificate. The certificate will then be shown as an option in this form control.

    You can also select the `Manually enter certificate in the textarea.` option to manually specify the SSL certificate in PEM format on the webhook configuration.

    When a Key is selected or a certificate is provided, an in memory keystore will be generated in order to complete the `https` connection to the webhook.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>


### Tenants
<Aside type="version">
Available since 1.37.0
</Aside>

Here's the configuration when a webhook will be sent for all tenants.

<img src="/img/docs/extend/events-and-webhooks/webhook-settings-tenants.png" alt="Webhook Settings - All applications" width="1200" role="shadowed bottom-cropped top-cropped" />

Here's the configuration when a webhook should be sent for certain tenants.

<img src="/img/docs/extend/events-and-webhooks/webhook-settings-tenants-selection.png" alt="Webhook Settings - Select Applications" width="1200" role="shadowed bottom-cropped top-cropped" />


#### Form Fields

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="All tenants">
    When this toggle is enabled, events for all tenants will be sent to this webhook.
  </APIField>

  <APIField name="Tenants">
    When the <InlineField>All tenants</InlineField> setting is disabled, this field will be exposed. Select the tenants for which you would like to receive events.

    Most events are scoped to a tenant. Selecting one more more tenants will cause FusionAuth to send events only for those tenants.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

The exceptions to this are the following system events which are not tenant specific:

* `audit-log.create`
* `event-log.create`
* `kickstart.success`

These events are configured at the system level and cannot be scoped to a certain tenant.

### Headers

<img src="/img/docs/extend/events-and-webhooks/webhook-settings-headers.png" alt="Webhook Settings - HTTP Headers" width="1200" role="top-cropped" />

#### Form Fields

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="Name">
    The name of the header to add to the HTTP request when sending the event to the webhook
  </APIField>

  <APIField name="Value">
    The header value to add to the HTTP request when sending the event to the webhook
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

### Applications
<ApplicationWebhooksWarning />

<img src="/img/docs/extend/events-and-webhooks/webhook-settings-applications.png" alt="Webhook Settings - All applications" width="1200" role="shadowed bottom-cropped top-cropped" />

<img src="/img/docs/extend/events-and-webhooks/webhook-settings-applications-selection.png" alt="Webhook Settings - Select Applications" width="1200" role="shadowed bottom-cropped top-cropped" />

#### Form Fields

<APIBlock>

  <APIField name="All applications" deprecated>
    When this toggle is enabled, all events will be sent to this webhook.

    <APIDeprecatedRemoved version="1.37.0" description="In version 1.37.0 and beyond, webhooks are scoped to tenants." />
  </APIField>

  <APIField name="Applications" deprecated>
    When the <InlineField>All applications</InlineField> is disabled, this field will be exposed. Select the application for which you would like to receive events.

    Not all events are considered application specific and selecting an application will limit you to only receiving application events. The following events are considered Application events:

    * `jwt.public-key.update`
    * `jwt.refresh-token.revoke`
    * `user.action`

    In most cases you will want to use the <InlineField>All applications</InlineField> configuration.

    <APIDeprecatedRemoved version="1.37.0" description="In version 1.37.0 and beyond, webhooks are global or are scoped to tenants." />
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

## Test a Webhook

Once you have a webhook up and running and configured to receive JSON events from FusionAuth you may wish to test it by sending different events. FusionAuth has built in a test capability to allow you to construct any event and send it to your webhook.

Navigate to <strong>Settings -> Webhooks</strong> and select the purple <Icon name="exchange" /> icon for the webhook you wish to test. Select the event type to test, optionally modify the JSON to test a specific scenario and then use the send button in the top right to send the event to the webhook.

<img src="/img/docs/extend/events-and-webhooks/webhook-test.png" alt="Webhook Test" width="1200" role="shadowed" />

Modifications to event JSON will be preserved across tests. If you want to reset the JSON for a given event, select that event and click the <Icon name="undo" /> Reset button.

### Form Fields

<APIBlock>
  <APIField name="URL">
    The URL of the webhook you are testing. If you wish to test a different webhook return to the webhook menu and select the test action on another webhook.
  </APIField>

  <APIField name="Event type">
    The selected event type to send to the webhook.
  </APIField>

  <APIField name="Event">
    The JSON event to send to the webhook. This is a generated example and it may be modified before sending to replicate a specific scenario.
  </APIField>
</APIBlock>

## FAQs

**Q:** I have successfully tested my Webhook, but why am I not receiving specific live events?

**A:** In order to receive events to your webhook endpoint, ensure the following items are configured:

* Set up the Tenant events. Navigate to <strong>Tenants -> Webhooks</strong> and enable the specific events.
* Set up Webhook tenants. Navigate to <strong>Settings -> Webhooks -> Tenants</strong> and ensure the Webhook is configured either for <InlineUIElement>All tenants</InlineUIElement> or your desired tenant or tenants.
* Set up the Webhook events. Navigate to <strong>Settings -> Webhooks -> Events</strong> and ensure the specific events are enabled for the Webhook.

Unless all three of these configurations are correct, you won't receive events to your configured endpoint.
