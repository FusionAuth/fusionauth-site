## Securing Webhooks

FusionAuth sends JSON events to your configured Webhooks that might include user information or other sensitive data. Therefore, it is important to ensure that your Webhooks are secured properly to prevent data from being leaked or stolen.

This document covers the standard methods for securing Webhooks. You can also [learn more about verifying webhook message integrity](/docs/extend/events-and-webhooks/signing).
