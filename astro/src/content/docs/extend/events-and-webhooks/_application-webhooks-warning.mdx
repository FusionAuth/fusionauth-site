<Aside type="caution">
This documentation is for versions earlier than 1.37.0. Application scoped events are not supported on versions later than 1.37.0. If you are on a version earlier than 1.37.0 and you want to get events for certain applications, the preferred method is to send events for a tenant. Filter on the `applicationId` when consuming the event and discard events from any applications not of interest.

**Please don't use application scoped webhook functionality.**
</Aside>

Prior to version 1.37.0 these events could be application scoped:

* `jwt.public-key.update`
* `jwt.refresh-token.revoke`
* `user.action`
