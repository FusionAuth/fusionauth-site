To use FusionAuth with Permify, you need to do the following:

Let's look at each of these in more detail.

## Jargon

Permify using the term entities to refer to anything that can have a relation in an authorization model. This is distinct and different from [FusionAuth entities](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/entity-management).

For the remainder of this document, when the term entities is used, it refers to Permify entities.


## Installing Permify

To install Permify, please refer to the [Permify deployment guides](https://docs.permify.co/setting-up/installation/intro). These also offer guidane on system requirements and how to deploy the software into Kubernetes and other environments.

For local development you can install Permify using Docker compose in the same file as FusionAuth.

## Set Up The Permify Schema

The next step is to set up the schema. This defines the relationships between different entities in Permify.



You can test your custom schema using the [Permify playground](https://play.permify.co/) which lets you verify correctness as well as visualize your permission structures.
