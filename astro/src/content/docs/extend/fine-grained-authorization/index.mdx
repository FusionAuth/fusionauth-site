## Overview

Fine-grained authorization (FGA) makes granular decisions about what data and features users can access within your applications.

Unlike the role-based access control (RBAC) provided by FusionAuth [roles](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/roles) and [applications](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/applications), fine-grained authorization enables you to define custom permissions for specific resources. You can also implement attribute-based access control (ABAC), relationship based access control (ReBaC), or create custom permission models tailored to your application's requirements.

## Examples

Here are examples of systems where FGA is useful:

* Facebook Groups, where all members can post, but only the original poster or group admins can edit a post.
* A healthcare system, where a doctor can only create, view or modify records for their patients. Patients can view their records or delegate access to a guardian. Only admins can delete a record.
* Google Drive, where a user can be granted permissions to a single file, a folder of files, or a drive containing many folders.
* A fintech application, where an organization can require approvals over a certain amount require either an admin to approve, or two organization members to approve
