## Overview

Fine-grained authorization (FGA) is an access control approach that enables you to make precise, granular decisions about what users can and cannot do within your applications. Rather than determining whether a user can access features or applications as a whole, fine-grained authorization lets you control access to particular features, data, and actions based on criteria like permissions, resource ownership, and contextual factors.

FusionAuth handles user authentication and manages application registrations and roles, fine-grained authorization using Permify takes things further by allowing you to implement complex permission schemes that go beyond role checks. 

This might include defining who can view, edit, or delete specific resources, implementing attribute-based access control (ABAC), or creating custom permission models tailored to your application's unique requirements.

FusionAuth provides several mechanisms to support authorization, including application roles, entity management for modeling resources and relationships, custom OAuth scopes for API access control, and entity grants for managing permissions between users and resources. When these aren't enough, reach for Permify for true attribute based access control (ABAC), relationship based access control (ReBAC), or more flexible role-based access control (RBAC).

## Examples

Here are some examples of FGA in action:

* Facebook Groups, where members can post, but only the original poster or group admins can edit a post.
* A healthcare system, where a doctor can only create, view or modify records for their patients. Patients can view their records and delegate access to a guardian. Only admins can delete a record.
* Google Drive, where a user can be granted permissions to a single file, a folder of files, or a drive containing many folders.
* A fintech application, where an organization can require approvals over a certain amount require either an admin to approve, or two organization members to approve
