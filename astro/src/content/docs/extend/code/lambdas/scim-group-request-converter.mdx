If you would like to convert an incoming SCIM Group request into a Group, you must specify a lambda in the SCIM configuration. This lambda will be invoked prior to the Group being acted upon.

When you create a new lambda using the FusionAuth UI we will provide you an empty function for you to implement.

## Lambda Structure

If you are using the API to create the lambda you will need to ensure your function has the following signature:

```javascript
function convert(group, members, options, scimGroup) {
  // Lambda code goes here
}
```

This lambda must contain a function named `convert` that takes four parameters. The parameters that the lambda is passed are:

* `group` - the FusionAuth Group object. You can modify this object.
* `members` - the members in this FusionAuth Group. You can modify this object.
  * `members[x].userId` - The Id of the FusionAuth User
  * `members[x].data.$ref` - The URI to retrieve the SCIM User representation of the FusionAuth User

    * ex. `https://login.piedpiper.com/api/scim/v2/Users/902c246b-6245-4190-8e05-00816be7344a`

* `options` - request options. You can modify this object.
  * `options.roleIds`
* `scimGroup` - the SCIM request object. This object is read-only.

The FusionAuth object is well documented in the [Group API](/docs/apis/groups) documentation. The SCIM Group object is a JavaScript object containing the SCIM Group request JSON payload. See [SCIM Group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-4.2).

You may add or modify anything in the `group`, `members` and `options` objects.

## Assigning The Lambda

Once a lambda is created, you must assign it to a Tenant. See the SCIM tab in the Tenant configuration.

## Default Lambda

A default SCIM Group Request Converter Lambda that converts an incoming SCIM Group request to a FusionAuth Group is available and may be used or modified. The lambda function is documented below.

```javascript
function convert(group, members, options, scimGroup) {
  // Un-comment this line to see the scimGroup object printed to the event log
  // console.info(JSON.stringify(scimGroup, null, 2));

  // Request options
  // FusionAuth allows you to assign one or more application roles to a group.
  // To use this feature, assign one or more application Ids here.
  // options.roleIds = [];

  // Set the name of the group using the SCIM Group displayName
  group.name = scimGroup.displayName;

  // Build a members array with a userId and a $ref in custom data
  if (scimGroup.members) {
    for (var i = 0; i < scimGroup.members.length; i++) {
      members.push({
        userId: scimGroup.members[i].value,
        data: {
          $ref: scimGroup.members[i]['$ref']
        }
      });
    }
  }
}
```
