## Nintendo Reconcile lambda

When an Nintendo identity provider is used to complete a federated login request to reconcile a user. Please note, there are multiple linking strategies when attempting to reconcile the user. Nintendo defaults to `CreatePendingLink`. You may optionally utilize a lambda to customize the user and user registration during this authentication event.

When you create a new lambda using the FusionAuth UI we will provide you an empty function for you to implement.

If you are using the API to create the lambda you will need to ensure your function has the following signature:

```javascript
function reconcile(user, registration, userInfo) {
  // Lambda code goes here
}
```

This lambda must contain a function named `reconcile` that takes three parameters. The parameters that the lambda is passed are:

<ReconcileLambdaUserRegistrationParameters />
* `userInfo` - the JSON payload returned by the Nintendo Token Info API. This is read-only.

The two FusionAuth objects are well documented here in the [User API](/docs/apis/users) and [Registration API](/docs/apis/registrations) documentation. The `userInfo` may contain various user claims depending upon the user's Nintendo configuration.

## Assigning the lambda

Once a lambda is created, you may assign it to the Nintendo identity provider in the IdP configuration.

Navigate to <strong>Settings -> Identity Providers</strong> and select your existing Nintendo configuration or click <strong>Add provider</strong> and select Nintendo if it has not yet been configured.
