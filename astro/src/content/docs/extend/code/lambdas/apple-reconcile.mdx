<ReconcileLambdaIntro identity_provider_name="Apple" prefix="an" />

## Lambda Structure

If you are using the API to create the lambda you will need to ensure your function has the following signature:

```javascript
function reconcile(user, registration, idToken) {
  // Lambda code goes here
}
```

This lambda must contain a function named `reconcile` that takes three parameters. The parameters that the lambda is passed are:

<ReconcileLambdaUserRegistrationParameters />
* `idToken` - the JSON payload of the validated and decoded Id Token returned from Apple. This object is read-only.

The two FusionAuth objects are well documented in the [User API](/docs/apis/users) and [Registration API](/docs/apis/registrations) documentation. The Id Token object that contains the payload returned by Apple and may contain well known OpenID Connect registered claims as well as any custom claims defined by Apple.

## Assigning The Lambda

Once a lambda is created, you may assign it to the Apple identity provider in the IdP configuration.

Navigate to <strong>Settings -> Identity Providers</strong> and select your existing Apple configuration or click <strong>Add provider</strong> and select Apple if it has not yet been configured.

## Default Lambda

A default Apple reconcile lambda is available in FusionAuth that may be used or modified. The default Apple lambda function is documented below.

```javascript
// This is the default Apple reconcile, modify this to your liking.
function reconcile(user, registration, idToken) {
  // Un-comment this line to see the idToken object printed to the event log
  // console.info(JSON.stringify(idToken, null, 2));

  // During the first login attempt, the user object will be available which may contain first and last name.
  if (idToken.user && idToken.user.name) {
    user.firstName = idToken.user.name.firstName || user.firstName;
    user.lastName = idToken.user.name.lastName || user.lastName;
  }
}
```
