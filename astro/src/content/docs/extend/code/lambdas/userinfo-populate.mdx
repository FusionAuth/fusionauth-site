If you would like to augment the claims provided in the UserInfo response, you can specify a lambda in the Application's OAuth configuration.

When you create a new lambda using the FusionAuth UI we will provide you an empty function for you to implement.

## Lambda Structure

If you are using the API to create the lambda you will need to ensure your function has the following signature:

```javascript
function populate(userInfo, user, registration, jwt) {
  // Lambda code goes here
}
```

This lambda must contain a function named `populate` that takes four parameters. The parameters that the lambda is passed are:

* `userInfo` - the claims object to be returned as a JSON payload
* `user` - the FusionAuth User object. This is read-only.
* `registration` - the FusionAuth UserRegistration object. This is read-only.
* `jwt` - the claims object from the provided JWT. This is read-only.

The two FusionAuth objects are well documented here in the [User API](/docs/apis/users) and [Registration API](/docs/apis/registrations) documentation. The JWT object is a JavaScript object containing the JWT payload. See [OpenID Connect & OAuth 2.0 Token](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/tokens).

You may add, remove, or modify anything in the `userInfo` object except for certain reserved claims. The following claims are considered reserved and modifications or removal will not be reflected in the final UserInfo response:

- `email`
- `email_verified`
- `sub`
- `tid`

## Assigning The Lambda

Once a lambda is created, you must assign it to an Application. See the <Breadcrumb>OAuth</Breadcrumb> tab in the Application configuration.

## Example Lambda

Here is an example of a simple Lambda that adds a few extra claims to the UserInfo response.

```javascript
function populate(userInfo, user, registration, jwt) {
  // Add a new claim named 'favoriteColor' from a custom data attribute on the user
  userInfo.favoriteColor = user.data.favoriteColor;
  // Add a new claim named 'dept' using a custom data attribute on the registration
  userInfo.dept = registration.data.departmentName;
  // Copy a claim named 'applicationId' from the provided JWT
  userInfo.applicationId = jwt.applicationId;

  // Create an event log of type 'Debug' when the lambda has Debug enabled
  console.debug('Added custom claims to the UserInfo response');
}
```
