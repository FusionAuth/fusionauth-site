During logins, password changes, and MFA Status API calls, FusionAuth performs various validations to decide whether to challenge the user on one of their MFA methods. Using this lambda function, you may extend this functionality to change FusionAuth's MFA decision for that user and/or trigger a suspicious login event.

The MFA Requirement Lambda has access to: the action being taken, FusionAuth's out of the box MFA decision, the user record, the user's registration for the application they're trying to authenticate to if applicable, the MFA policy settings on the tenant and application, and meta-data about the request. While Lambda HTTP Connect may be used in this function in order to utilize external resources to perform validation, please be aware that adding latency will likely be observable to your end user.

When you create a new lambda using the FusionAuth UI we will provide you an empty function for you to implement.

## Lambda Structure

If you are using the API to create the lambda you will need to ensure your function has the following signature:

```javascript
function validate(action, user, result, application, policies, context) {
  // Lambda code goes here
}
```
