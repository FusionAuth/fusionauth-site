If you would like to augment the claims provided in the JWT before it has been signed you can specify a lambda in the JWT configuration. This lambda will be invoked prior to the token being signed and issued as a result of the client credentials grant, on behalf of an Entity.

When you create a new lambda using the FusionAuth UI we will provide you an empty function for you to implement.

## Lambda Structure

If you are using the API to create the lambda you will need to ensure your function has the following signature:

```javascript
function populate(jwt, recipientEntity, targetEntities, permissions) {
  // Lambda code goes here
}
```

This lambda must contain a function named `populate` that takes four parameters. The parameters that the lambda is passed are:

* `jwt` - the claims object to be signed and return as the JWT payload. You can modify this object.
* `recipientEntity` - the Recipient Entity. This object is read-only. See an example below.
* `targetEntities` - the Target Entities. This object is read-only. See an example below.
* `permissions` - the permissions assigned to the Entity. This object is read-only. Example below.

The `recipientEntity` and `targetEntities` objects are well documented in the [Permissions & Entity Types APIs](/docs/apis/entities/entity-types) and [Entities API](/docs/apis/entities/entities) documentation. The JWT object is a JavaScript object containing the JWT payload. See [here for more](/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/oauth/tokens).

You may add or modify anything in the `jwt` object. However, you may not modify the header keys or values of the JWT. FusionAuth also protects certain reserved claims. The following claims are considered reserved and modifications or removal will not be reflected in the final JWT payload:

- `aud`
- `exp`
- `iat`
- `permissions`
- `sub`
- `tid`

The `tid` claim was added in version 1.36.0.

## Assigning The Lambda

Once a lambda is created, you must assign it. To do so via the administrative user interface, navigate to <Breadcrumb>Tenants -> Your Tenant -> OAuth</Breadcrumb> and update the <InlineField>Client credentials populate lambda</InlineField> setting.

### Example Entities And Permissions Objects

For these example objects (available in the lambda) there are three entities created (`reminder`, `todo`, and `email`) with an `api` entity type with `read` and `write` user defined permission values.
