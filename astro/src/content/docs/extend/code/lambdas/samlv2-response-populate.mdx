In order to handle complex integrations with SAML service providers, you can specify a lambda to be used by the FusionAuth SAML identity provider. This lambda will be invoked prior to the SAML response being sent back to the service provider.

When you create a new lambda using the FusionAuth UI we will provide you an empty function for you to implement.

## Lambda Structure

If you are using the API to create the lambda you will need to ensure your function has the following signature:

```javascript
function populate(samlResponse, user, registration) {
  // Lambda code goes here
}
```

This lambda must contain a function named `populate` that takes three parameters. The parameters that the lambda is passed are:

* `samlResponse` - the SAML v2 response object. You can modify this object.
* `user` - the FusionAuth User object. This object is read-only.
* `registration` - the FusionAuth UserRegistration object. This object is read-only.

The two FusionAuth objects are well documented in the [User API](/docs/apis/users) and [Registration API](/docs/apis/registrations) documentation. The SAML response object mimics the format of the XML document, but is designed to be much simpler to use than dealing with the DOM object model. Here is a list of the fields you have access to manipulate in the SAML response:

<SamlResponseFields />

## Assigning The Lambda

Once a lambda is created, you may assign it to one or more applications in the SAML configuration. See the SAML tab in the Application configuration.

## Example Lambda

Here is an example of a simple Lambda that sets a few extra parameters into the SAML response from the User, including some custom data:

```javascript
function populate(samlResponse, user, registration) {
  // Set an attribute named 'roles' from the User assigned roles for this registration
  samlResponse.assertion.attributes['roles'] = registration.roles || [];
  // Set an attribute named 'favoriteColor' using the custom data attribute named 'favoriteColor'
  samlResponse.assertion.attributes['favoriteColor'] = [user.data.favoriteColor];
}
```
