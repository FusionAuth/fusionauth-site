## Lambda Structure

If you are using the API to create the lambda you will need to ensure your function has the following signature:

```javascript
function reconcile(user, registration, userInfo) {
  // Lambda code goes here
}
```

This lambda must contain a function named `reconcile` that takes the following parameters. The parameters that the lambda is passed are:

<ReconcileLambdaUserRegistrationParameters />
* `userInfo` - data returned by the Epic Games Account API. This object is read-only.

The two FusionAuth objects are well documented in the [User API](/docs/apis/users) and [Registration API](/docs/apis/registrations) documentation. The `idToken` may contain various user claims depending upon the user's Epic Games configuration.

## Assigning The Lambda

Once a lambda is created, you may assign it to the Epic Games identity provider in the IdP configuration.

Navigate to <strong>Settings -> Identity Providers</strong> and select your existing Epic Games configuration or click <strong>Add provider</strong> and select Epic Games if it has not yet been configured.
