When {props.prefix} {props.identity_provider_name} identity provider is used to complete a federated login request FusionAuth will use the configured linking strategy to reconcile the user; that is to match the user to an existing account or create a new one. You may optionally utilize a lambda to customize the user and user registration during this authentication event.

When you create a new lambda using the FusionAuth UI we will provide you an empty function for you to implement.
