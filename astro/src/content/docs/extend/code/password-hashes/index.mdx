## Overview

FusionAuth provides a plugin mechanism that loads plugins at startup rather than at runtime. This provides much better performance than a runtime plugin system. 

<Aside type="note">
You must restart FusionAuth anytime a plugin is installed.
</Aside>

There are two steps to adding a plugin to FusionAuth:

1. Write the plugin by implementing the correct plugin interface
2. Install the plugin into your FusionAuth installation

Currently the only extension points offered by plugins are custom password hashing schemes.
