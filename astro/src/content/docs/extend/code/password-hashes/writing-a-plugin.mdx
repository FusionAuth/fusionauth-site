## Install Java 8

If you haven't already, you need to download the Java 8 JDK. This contains all of the tools you need to compile Java projects and create JAR files. You can download the Java 8 JDK from the Oracle at the following link.

- https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html

### Get the Example Code

To begin, clone the following GitHub repository. This example code will assume you are able to use the Maven build commands.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-password-encryptor.git
cd fusionauth-example-password-encryptor
mvn compile package
```

If the above commands were successful you have now downloaded the example code and performed and initial build of the jar. If last command was not found, you do not yet have Maven build tool installed. You may utilize whatever Java build system you prefer, such as Maven, Ant, Gradle or Savant. This example will use the Maven build system.

The following is a representation of the plugin project layout.

```plaintext title="Plugin Project Layout"
fusionauth-example-password-encryptor
  |
  |- src
  |   |- main
  |   |   |- java
  |   |
  |   |- test
  |       |- java
  |
  |- pom.xml
```

Following the Java convention of using packages for all classes, you will want to create sub-directories under src/main/java and src/test/java that identify the package for your plugin. For example, you might create a directory under each called `com/mycompany/fusionauth/plugins` that will contain your plugin code.

In the example code you are beginning from, you will find the Plugin `MyExamplePasswordEncryptor` in the package `com/mycompany/fusionauth/plugins`.

Your project is now ready for you to start coding.

## Edit Your Build File

To modify the name of your plugin, edit your build file.  Below is a small portion of the build file, you may change whatever you like, but to start with you will want to change the `groupId` and the `artifactId`. These values are used to name the jar that will be built later.


```xml title="pom.xml"
  <groupId>io.fusionauth</groupId>
  <artifactId>fusionauth-example-password-encryptor</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0</version>
```

## Code the Plugin

This is where you get to code! Ideally you would have one or two known passwords in the data you will be importing to FusionAuth so that you can test your plugin prior to installing it in FusionAuth.

Begin by modifying the `MyExamplePasswordEncryptor` class found in `src/main/java`.

You will find a test ready for you to use called `MyExamplePasswordEncryptorTest` in the package `com/mycompany/fusionauth/plugins` in the `src/test/java` directory. Use this test to assert on one or two known plain text passwords to ensure that the hash you calculate is equal to the actual hash that you will be importing from your existing system.

You can run the test like so: `mvn test`.

You will also find a few other example plugins that are written and tested that you can review to get an idea of how they work. You may delete any of the example code you do not want in your final jar.

### Matching Salt and Encryption

The only two required methods for you to implement are `defaultFactor()`, and `encrypt(String password, String salt, int factor)`.  There are two additional methods that are optional: `generateSalt()` and `validateSalt(String salt)`.

If you do not implement these methods in your plugin, the default implementations below will be used:

*`PasswordEncryptor` interface with default `generateSalt` and `validateSalt` methods*
<RemoteCode url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-plugin-api/main/src/main/java/io/fusionauth/plugin/spi/security/PasswordEncryptor.java" lang="java" />

If your plugin requires a specific salt length differing from the default implementation, implement these methods in your plugin to generate a salt that meets your requirements.

In other words, the salt generated by your plugin should be consumable by the custom `encrypt` method.

### Using Dependencies

Oftentimes you'll have dependencies for your plugin code.
This is especially true if you are leveraging other cryptographic libraries to ensure password hashes are created correctly.

If you are using FusionAuth `1.36.0` or later and have dependencies, you can place dependencies along with your password plugin into a single directory and that will be loaded in a separate class loader. Please note, that while your plugin will be loaded into a new class loader, it will still share the classpath with FusionAuth. For this reason, you should still be cautious when including dependencies. If at all possible reduce dependencies to a minimum.

If you are using FusionAuth version `1.35.0` or before, and have dependencies, make sure you use the `maven-shade-plugin` plugin to shade your dependencies, or a similar plugin to combine the jar files. Using this strategy, your plugin must be deployed as an uberjar.

## Create the Guice binding

FusionAuth uses Guice for dependency injection and also to setup plugins. No matter what type of plugin you are writing, you need to add a single Guice module to your project.

<Aside type="caution">
In order for FusionAuth to locate your plugin, the package you put your plugin module into must include a parent package named either plugin or plugins. For example, a plugin class cannot be named `com.mycompany.fusionauth.MyExampleFusionAuthPluginModule`. Instead, it must be named `com.mycompany.fusionauth.plugins.MyExampleFusionAuthPluginModule`.
</Aside>

Edit the example Guice module in the `src/main/java` directory: `com/mycompany/fusionauth/plugins/guice/MyExampleFusionAuthPluginModule.java`.

Here is an example of what you will find in the example Guice module referenced above.

<RemoteCode title="Guice Module" lang="java" url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-password-encryptor/main/src/main/java/com/mycompany/fusionauth/plugins/guice/MyExampleFusionAuthPluginModule.java" />

Notice that this plugin is annotated with the class `io.fusionauth.plugin.spi.PluginModule`. This is how FusionAuth locates the Guice module and installs your plugin.

## Building

This will assume you using the Maven build tool. You are welcome to utilize any Java build tool that you wish.

```shell
mvn clean compile package
ls -lah ./target/*.jar
-rw-r--r--  1 robotdan  staff   4.5K Apr 24 08:06 ./target/fusionauth-example-password-encryptor-0.1.0.jar
```

The above command will compile and build a jar artifact that we will install onto FusionAuth. The jar found in the `target` directory is your plugin.

## Install the Plugin

After you have completed your plugin code and all of your unit tests pass, you are ready to install the plugin into FusionAuth.
You will utilize the jar build output file from the previous step.

Next, you need to create the plugin directory in your FusionAuth installation. Depending on where you installed FusionAuth, you will create the plugin directory in the `FUSIONAUTH_HOME` directory. This directory is the directory right above the `FUSIONAUTH_HOME` directory. Here are some examples for the plugin directory:

```plaintext title="Linux and macOS"
/usr/local/fusionauth/plugins
```

```plaintext title="Windows"
\fusionauth\plugins
```

The location of this directory might be different if you install using the ZIP bundles and placed FusionAuth somewhere else.

Next, you copy this JAR file from your plugin project into the plugin directory like this:

```shell title="Linux/Mac/Unix"
cp target/fusionauth-example-password-encryptor-0.1.0.jar /usr/local/fusionauth/plugins
```

```plaintext title="Windows"
cp target\fusionauth-example-password-encryptor-0.1.0.jar \fusionauth\plugins
```

Now you can restart FusionAuth to load your plugin.

If you plugin is found and loaded successfully, you should see a message like this in the logs:

```
INFO  io.fusionauth.api.plugin.guice.PluginModule - Installing plugin [com.mycompany.fusionauth.plugins.guice.MyExampleFusionAuthPluginModule]
INFO  io.fusionauth.api.plugin.guice.PluginModule - Plugin successfully installed
```

At this point, you should be able to log in to the administrative user interface, navigate to <strong>Tenants -> Your Tenant -> Password</strong> and scroll to the <strong>Cryptographic hash settings</strong> section. Your new hashing scheme will appear in the <InlineField>Scheme</InlineField> field. This is another way to verify the plugin is installed in FusionAuth.

<img src="/img/docs/extend/code/password-hashes/hash-settings-new-plugin.png" alt="Tenant settings with a new plugin installed." width="1200" />

Do not set the <InlineField>Scheme</InlineField> field to that new plugin value unless you want all users in that tenant to use that hash.

### Installing On FusionAuth Cloud

The above instructions document how to install a plugin on a self-hosted FusionAuth system, where you have access to the file system and/or container image where FusionAuth is running. 

[FusionAuth Cloud](/docs/get-started/run-in-the-cloud/cloud) does not allow such access, among [other limits](/docs/get-started/run-in-the-cloud/cloud#limits).

If you have a FusionAuth Cloud deployment and want to install a custom plugin, please [open a support ticket](https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support). Make sure you include the jar file as an attachment.

The FusionAuth support team will then coordinate with you to install the plugin and restart FusionAuth.

## Multiple Plugins

You are allowed to have as many plugins as you want. This may occur if you are consolidating multiple systems into FusionAuth, each with their own password hashing algorithm.

When you do so, ensure you have unique values for the classname, the test name and the binding name.
They may remain in the same package and maven artifact or jar file.

<Aside type="caution">
If you do not ensure that each hashing class has a unique name and binding value, system behavior is undetermined.
</Aside>

For example, to have two plugins based on the above example plugin project, copy the following files:

* `MyExamplePasswordEncryptor.java` to `MyOtherExamplePasswordEncryptor.java`
* `MyExamplePasswordEncryptorTest.java` to `MyOtherExamplePasswordEncryptorTest.java`

Then modify the `MyOtherExamplePasswordEncryptor` files to implement and test the new hash.

Finally, add the following to the `MyExampleFusionAuthPluginModule.java` file:

```java
passwordEncryptorMapBinder.addBinding("custom-other-hash").to(MyOtherExamplePasswordEncryptor.class);
```

Please note, when selecting the string value that will be used as your `encryptionScheme`, please do prefix it with `custom-` or your company such as `acme-` to avoid the possibility of a name collision if FusionAuth were to add additional hashing schemes in the base product.

You can then build and install the plugin in the same fashion as you would with one plugin.

### Multiple Plugin Projects

You may also have multiple plugin projects. This may make sense if you want more logical separation between the plugin code.

In that case, ensure that the guice module class, the package name and the `artifactId` values are distinct.

If you have two projects, you'll have to build and deploy each of the artifacts to the correct location in FusionAuth.
