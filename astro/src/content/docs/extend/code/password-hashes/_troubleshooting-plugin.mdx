import InlineUIElement from 'src/components/InlineUIElement.astro';

If your plugin is not installed, ensure:

* You added the binding with a unique name to a Guice module.
* The jar file is valid and contains both the Guice module and the implementation of the `PasswordEncryptor` class.
* The plugin jar file is in the top level `plugins` directory (the peer to the `bin` and `config` directories). This directory may need to be created.
* The jar file and the `plugins` directory are accessible to the FusionAuth instance.

If you have verified the plugin is installed via the administrative user interface or log messages, but a user with a known password cannot login successfully:

* Ensure that users are imported using the correct name in the <InlineField>encryptionScheme</InlineField> field. Review other settings such as the factor as well.
* Add tests to double check that you are hashing the passwords in the way you expect.
