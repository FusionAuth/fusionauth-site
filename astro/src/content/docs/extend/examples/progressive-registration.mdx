Registration is one of the most important parts of authentication. Getting as much information as possible in registration is crucial for your app, especially if you are working on critical fields or need some information. 

However, UX is important, and bombarding potential users with multiple fields is bad for UX. FusionAuth provides a feature for progressive registration, where users can enter information incrementally on various pages or components. This can be done using the FusionAuth admin dashboard or the API. 

Either way, in this guide, you will learn how to implement progressive registration in your application. We will also explore two methods to achieve this, whether by the admin dashboard, or the FusionAuth API.

## Requirements

To implement progressive registration, you will need a FusionAuth license to access more advanced registration features. This guide will be based on the 
ChangeBank application, that we will extend to include progressive registration. However, the steps are applicable to any application, while you 
know the requirements for your application.

Reading this guide also let us suppose that you have already an application created, and an API key created.

## Implementing

The registration flow in this guide will go in two steps: 
- The user will be presented with a form to enter their basic information such as first name, last name, email.
- The user will be then presented with a form to enter their password and register completely.

The challenge here is how to manage the routing to the home page, even more when you might need the user to enter specific information, on the home page
after a successful registration. This can be for example, entering a credit card number or being prompted to create an entity such as a project 
or anything else that might be required to use the application.

This next steps will cover two methods to achieve this, using the FusionAuth admin dashboard or the FusionAuth API.

### Using FusionAuth Admin

Using the FusionAuth admin dashboard, you can create a registration form that will be used to collect the basic information, and then a second form 
that will be used to collect the password and complete the registration. Once you have activated a license for your FusionAuth instance, you can create an advanced registration form at 
**Home > Customizations > Forms**. On this page, click on the **Add** button. You will be presented with a form to create a new form with fields such as 
`name` that can be arbitrary, the `type` that in this case should be** Registration** and the **Form steps** section where you will be 
customizing the registration form.

Once the name and type are set, you can add the fields you want to collect. In this case, we will add a field for the first name, a field for the last name, 
and a field for the email for the first step. The second step will be used to collect the password and complete the registration.

After that, you will need to do two things:
- Enable Self Registration on the application on **Applications > Your Application > Registration** and select the form 
to use for registration.

- Configure a wildcard on the Authorized redirect URLs in **Applications -> Edit Application -> OAuth**. Ensure that the URL validation setting is configured to `Allow wildcards`. This wildcard will be used 
to know if the user is coming from the registration page or not.

Once this is done, you can view the details about your application, and you will see the registration URL.
