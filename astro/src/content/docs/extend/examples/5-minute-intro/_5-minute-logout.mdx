import {RemoteCode} from '@fusionauth/astro-components';

Of course, for every login, there should be a corresponding logout. Log out by clicking on the "Logout" link. This will log you out of both FusionAuth and the application.

Here's the pug code which builds a link to log the user out.

<RemoteCode lang="javascript"
            title="The Logout Link"
            url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-5-minute-guide/main/views/index.pug"
            tags="logoutLink" />

When you visit this link, you're sent to FusionAuth, where the FusionAuth session is destroyed, and then to the application's logout URL. This URL was configured when you set up the Application in FusionAuth, and has the value of `http://localhost:3000/logout`.

That route destroys the local session, logging you out from the Node.js application, and then sending you back to the home page.

<RemoteCode lang="javascript"
            title="Destroying the Local Session"
            url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-5-minute-guide/main/routes/index.js"
            tags="logoutRoute" />

Now you are logged out.
