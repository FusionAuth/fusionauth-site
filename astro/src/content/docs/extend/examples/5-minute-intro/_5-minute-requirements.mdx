  You need to have either a MySQL or PostgreSQL database installed. You also need a superuser name and password for the database; this user needs to be able to create schemas and databases.

  If you do not have a database installed, follow the instructions in our [Database Installation Guide](/docs/get-started/download-and-install/database) to install a database. Below, you see commands to test if the PostgreSQL command line tool, `psql`, is present.
