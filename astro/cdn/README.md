FusionAuth Email Signatures

The FusionAuth email signature files (noted by the "email-signature" in the file name) are specific assets that should not be modified without checking with the Digital Creative Director or Design.

If you are to modify the asset or change the URL source all team emails will break. 

Be careful if you're to change anything with "email-signature" in the file name within this folder.

Thanks!
