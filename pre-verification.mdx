## Overview

As of version 1.62.0, FusionAuth can be configured to verify a user's identities during the registration process, prior to creating the user.

To enable pre-verification, do the following:
* For phone: Create/configure a Messenger
* For email: Configure the Tenant Email Server
* Enable verification for the identity types(s) on the tenant
* Create an advanced registration form with the verification step(s) added
* Enable self-service registration in your app and assign the advanced registration form

Let's step through each of these, but first, there are some required prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

<PremiumPlanBlurb />

- This tutorial assumes you are running FusionAuth version 1.62.0 or greater. If you aren't, head on over to the [installation guide](/docs/get-started/download-and-install) or the [upgrade guide](/docs/operate/deploy/upgrade) to update to a version with support for this feature.

- This tutorial also assumes you have a paid plan and valid license. If you need to buy a plan, please visit the [pricing page](/pricing). If you need to activate your instance, please visit the [Reactor page](/docs/get-started/core-concepts/licensing).

### Gating vs Verification vs. Pre-Verification

<Aside type="note">
    Email Verification, pre-verification, and Application Registration Verification are not premium features, however enforcing pre-verification with Advanced Registration Forms is. 
</Aside>

FusionAuth ships with registration verification and identity verification flows. These verification flows update the `verified` and `verifiedReason` attributes on a user's registration or on a user identity. You have the option to gate the user (or prevent them from "continuing" auth) based on these attributes when writing your application and integration code.

With paid FusionAuth plans, you can elect to have _FusionAuth_ "gate" your users based on these verification attributes. Gating in this sense, would prevent the user from authenticating further or obtaining a JWT and _would be enforced by the FusionAuth User Interface_. Gating happens *after* user creation.

Pre-verification applies the same concept, but user identities must be verified *before* user creation.

## Common Questions

**Question**: Why is my verification step not showing up in registration?

**Answer**: There are several reasons why this can happen:
1. The tenant the user is created with does not have verification enabled (forms can be shared with multiple tenants, so there is no guarantee, when the form is created, which tenant the form will be used with).
2. If the <InlineField>user.email</InlineField> or <InlineField>user.phoneNumber</InlineField> field is optional and the user chooses not to enter a value, then verification steps for those fields will be skipped.
3. When registration is being completed for an existing user, to an application, verification steps are skipped, because they only apply to new users. For existing users, see [Gate Users Until They Verify Their Email
](/docs/lifecycle/manage-users/verification/gate-accounts-until-user-email-verified) or [Gate Users Until They Verify Their Phone Number
](/docs/lifecycle/manage-users/verification/gate-accounts-until-user-phone-verified) for more details.

## Next Steps

Now that you've successfully set up gated phone verification, take the next steps to integrate this functionality into your application:

* Discover how to [modify your theme](/docs/customize/look-and-feel/) to make the phone verification gate pages look like your application.
* Learn more about [email/message templates](/docs/customize/email-and-messages/) and how to customize them.
